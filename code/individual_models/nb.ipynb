      "the truth about cbdcs design choice by ecb fed analysed both are aiming at tight control or account interest and spending a digital prison is being built in the shadow due diligence the truth about cbdcs ominous design realed a digital prison is being built in the shadow massi orreach of central bank underway they are designing a new kind of money allowing them to establish centralized settlement of all payment tie digital identity to all transaction and record them on a central bank ledger forer force built in feature such a limit on how much cbdc you can ha in your account negati interest rate account charge in line with regulatory objectis and cap on conrsions and spending create money that is traceable programmable taxable and subject to the monetary whim of central planner st out spending without permission and slowly phase out cash the war on money continues the aim to replace cash with a system of centralized control or all transaction and account balance this report explains exactly what to expect from central bank digital currency cbdcs it look at the possible design option what central bank ha decided so far and the likely outcome the ugly conclusion is that cbdcs are a new form of currency that allows a small group of unelected people control or what we can and cannot do with our own money lt what is going on a lot ha been said and written about cbdcs most wa speculation but now evidence emerges of what is being built gin that our financial system is complex one cannot just click a button and introduce a cbdc a of now much work ha already been e and much is still to be e this report trace the historical path of the delopment of cbdcs we start with looking at what cbdcs are then we look at why we need them a explained by the bank of international settlement bi next we look at how cbdcs are designed a the central regulator of central bank the bi made an inntory of all the different design option for cbdcs it also provided an honest account of the potential benefit and downside of those choice with this knowledge we can analyze the design choice made so far we obser how the european central bank ecb is going full steam ahead with their cbdc we come to the shocking discory that the most important design choice ha already been made and that there ha en been company hired to start programming next we analyze what is happening in the u the u federal reser fed is not a far advanced with their cbdc a the ecb hower their frank report real that their cbdc design choice result in similar control mechanism a that of the ecb and it en expose possible sinister motis to put it bluntly what central bank are choosing for design so far tell u all we need to know about where this is heading authority are downplaying what is going on and pretending that all is open for debate and subjected to the democratic process but the design they are secretly pushing forward open the door to the dystopian future we all fear lt what are central bank digital currency before we can continue we ha to define cbdcs after all we already ha digital money but cbdcs and what we currently use a digital money are ry different thing what we currently refer to a digital money is not issued by the central bank in the modern financial system the central bank only creates money in the form of cash bill and coin and cash deposit with bank all other money is created by private bank that s right the digital money currently in use is created by private institution the digital unit in your bank account are issued by a private bank cbdcs on the contrary are digital public money issued by the central bank cbdcs are a totally new kind of money with many new feature to summarize we go from two type to three type of retail money cash public money current digital money private money current cbdc public money new source ecb digital euro our future money note that cbdcs are essentially just different form of the same currency one unit of cash is on par with one unit of cbdc they are interchangeable for reason explained later these form of money are also intended to exist alongside each other for the foreseeable future to summarize central bank are issuing a new rsion of money which is a liability of the central bank a such cbdcs are not just another form of digital money a public money they are more comparable to the other form of public money cash this begs the question why do we need an addition replacement for cash lt why do we need cbdcs according to central bank there is much debate on why cbdcs are being rolled out to avoid speculation we will stick with what the bi ha said about why we need cbdcs this approach help u to understand the decision central bank ha taken and what the logical outcome will be financial stability and the reduced role of public moneyor the past few year cash ha become le popular this present a problem use a shown cash is currently the only form of public money used by the public retail and so when cash is phased out so is public money a principal concern of central bank is that if in the future cash were no longer widely accepted or available a sere financial crisis in the private financial system might create further havoc by disrupting day to day business and retail transaction cbdcs would be a way to keep the economy functioning monetary policyanother benefit of cbdcs touted by the bi is that they allow for a more direct influence on monetary policy argument for issuing a cbdc include potential strengthening of the pas through of the policy rate to money market and deposit rate and helping to alleviate the zero or effecti lower bound constraint the bi also argues for direct stimulus let s take a look at each benefit strengthening of the pas through of the policy rate mean more control or the interest rate charged throughout the financial system central bank wish to bypass private bank and set rate directly from the moment that household consider a cbdc to be an alternati to commercial bank deposit bank will ha le scope for independently setting the interest rate on deposit of the general public the zero lower bound describes the limit of negati interest rate in short in an environment of increasingly lower interest rate on bank account people might pull their money out of the bank it is after all better to hold cash than money in an account that charge deep negati interest rate to address this issue the imf circulated a paper called breaking through the zero lower bound it explores the idea of having different interest rate for different form of money for exle an additional interest rate on cash can ry easily be charged on private bank through what is known a the cash window at the central bank the central bank charge the regular bank for the use of cash and the bank then charge the user through extra fee on withdrawal and deposit this way the use of cash can be made more expensi than digital form of money this mechanism can be applied to steer the use of different form of money and en be a stepping stone on the road to a cashless society a you ll see later the imf s idea of different interest rate for different kind of money is vigorously embraced by central bank for exle the nigerian central bank used this idea to restrict cash shortly after introducing their unpopular cbdc and finally according to the bi cbdcs could facilitate a more direct distribution of fiscal stimulus to those member of the general public who need it this could make such policy more effecti than general helicopter money or distribution through the indirect and imperfect banking channel which ha been used in the past financial inclusionanother buzzword central bank like to use is financial inclusion with a cbdc eryone could ha access to basic financial service this would be especially interesting for people not serd by the current financial system which is a situation more prevalent outside the deloped world but a always like much else in the dirsity and inclusion agenda these rosy goal are mostly a facade one of the most prominent organisation behind financial inclusion is the united nation for whom the financial inclusion agenda allows the unlocking of public and private resource to fund their sustainable delopment goal the un in turn coordinate it policy through the better than cash alliance an ngo acting a a front for the interest of among others the bill melinda gate foundation citi bank mastercard and visa inc in this light inclusi finance can be seen a the conrsion of the unbanked into tax and debt serf who pay transaction fee and ser a collateral for the financial system financial innovationthe bi is discussing all sort of other feature all made possible by the idea of programmable money a we will see most of this innovation is in the interest of central bank one of the promised benefit of cbdcs is that it can make international payment much more efficient and transparent use these kind of liability are being built from scratch cbdcs are billed a offering a unique opportunity to facilitate easier cross border payment lt cbdc design choicesbefore we continue it is important to note that there ha been few official decision made a to how to mo forward the introduction of a cbdc requires significant work and central bank are moving slowly in order not to break anything in this next section we look at the orviews the bi ha made on designing cbdcs lot of research ha been e across academia financial institution and the central bank and the bi ha created a nice summary of the design option it also real what the benefit and downside of these design choice are with this knowledge we can then look at the design decision that ha already been made by the ecb and fed and hence conclude what is happening behind the scene token v identity basedfirst of all a choice ha to be made a to whether the cbdc is to be token based or tied to an identity through an account according to the bi it ha to be either one or the other source bi quarterly review march a token based system would work like other crypto currency those with the private key can spend the money but the drawback according to the bi are sere one is the high risk of losing fund if end user fail to keep their private key secret furthermore it would be challenging to design an effecti regulatory framework for such a system law enforcement agency would run into difficulty when seeking to identify claim owner or follow money flow just a with cash or bearer security in addition a token system would nullify the central bank objectis discussed abo the other option is that the use and ownership of a cbdc is accessible through an account tied to an identity similar to how the current banking system operates to make this happen the bi call for strong identity for all account holder where each individual is tied to one identifier across the entire payment system the disadvantage of an account based system according to a paper of the bi are that you cannot ha anonymity vi a vi the central bank and there cannot be private peer to peer transaction without an intermediary a is currently possible with cash see graph source bi committee on payment and market infrastructure cbdcs direct or indirect liability the next question should people ha an account directly with the central bank or through intermediary financial institution here the consideration are not just about what is desirable but also what is practically feasible currently central bank simply do not ha the infrastructure to hold account for hundred of million of citizen in addition there are regulatory obligation such a kyc and customer due diligence that central bank do not ha the infrastructure and mandate for the most logical outcome would be for central bank to use the existing financial company to roll out cbdcs on a more technical lel the question then becomes is the cbdc to be a liability on the balance sheet of the central bank or on the balance sheet of a financial intermediary with the latter option the cbdc would be an indirect liability of the central bank also known a a synthetic cbdc the bi doe not like this idea centralized v decentralizedanother choice need to be made between using a decentralized settlement system or a centralized one firstly for regulator decentralized doe not mean the same thing a it doe to the industry they see it a a few regulated entity validating the settlement system moreor regular consensus mechanism ha too much orhead and are too slow for the large number of transaction needed an issue the bi ha with a decentralized cbdc is that it mean that a decentralized network make adjustment to the balance sheet of the central bank this increase the risk to the system according to the bi programmabilityone of the main question a central bank ha to ask itself is whether it is going to create programmable money what is programmable money the u federal reser provides a good definition a digital form of money and a mechanism for specifying the automated behavior of that money through a computer program this mechanism is termed programmability in this note across the pond in individual country within the eu the need for programmable money is being debated hower a you will see in the following section programmability is an essential part of cbdcs the ecb ha en already released an api for institution to start programming financial stability requirementsthe fact that cbdcs are going to be exchangeable for digital currency result in some major risk to the financial system after all cbdcs make it easy to pull your money out of a private institution risk and deposit it with the central bank no risk if cbdcs could be freely traded the moment rumor spread that a bank is having issue all account holder will conrt their account balance to cbdcs guaranteed by the central bank you could ha instant bank run and collapse in the financial system would happen a quickly a they do in the crypto space in addition adding cbdcs increase the total amount of money in circulation creates en more inflation at a time when people are already having problem paying their bill a a result any cbdc need a built in mechanism to limit the amount of total cbdc that can be issued and limit how much can be exchanged for digital currency in short a programmable aspect of the cbdc ha to come into play we will see later how both the ecb and fed are already committed to using financial stability a an excuse to take full control or how cbdcs can be held charged and exchanged monetary policyone of the main activity of central bank or the last decade ha been trying to manage the economy through monetary policy up until now these interntions ha not always been effecti in kick starting the economy cbdcs can gi the central bank when properly designed much more direct tool for implementing monetary policy privacyprivacy is one of the main concern of regulator or at least it is the main concern for their potential user so this issue ha to be addressed in the design of the coin it is worth noting that privacy mean something different for central banker and for end user in the crypto space it mean that the technology make it impossible for anyone to track your purchase from the point of view of central bank privacy mean that the organisation monitoring and facilitating your payment are under constraint a to what they can and ha to do with your data moreor central bank compare the privacy of cbdcs with data mining private financial service company and with transaction being e on public blockchains they argue that in that light public institution are better at safeguarding privacy for the design of a cbdc a central bank ha to make a decision a to what lel of privacy a coin will ha taking into account that full privacy is considered incompatible with other policy objectis such a kyc and aml compliance a we will see there are strong indication that privacy a it is understood by the crypto industry is not going to be built into the cbdc system interoperabilitycentral bank will ha to make certain design choice such a whether foreigner are to be able to hold account with the central bank or if there is to be some sort of exchange facility perhaps similar to what the crypto industry call an atomic swap a coordinated cbdc design effort could take a clean slate perspecti and incorporate cross border payment option right from the start private v public chainon a final note instors in existing blockchains such a xlm or xrp ha been publicly claiming that cbdcs will be built with their chain a the base layer this is simply not going to happen a previously mentioned cbdcs are liability on the balance sheet of the central bank there is no way that they are going to base this on an existing blockchain use it would mean they would ha to take full control or the network now that we understand the different design choice available we can look behind the scene at how central bank are applying them starting with the ecb lt the digital euro ecb design choicesto understand the process of the creation of the digital euro we ha to recap how the eu work this is well described by todd huizinga a former american diplomat to the eu he explains in detail that the eu is run by elite who wish to create an er closer union regardless of the desire of the population of individual eu country a a result the eu ha created a culture where policy are presented a still being debated and subject to democratic principle whilst in fact behind closed door the direction is being agreed upon in backroom deal the same seems to apply to the eu s cbdc the digital euro the design and building of the digital euro is at an advanced stage while officially nothing ha been decided the reality hower is that the issuing of the euro and logically also the design of the digital euro is delegated to the european central banking system and a you will see in the remainder of this section the digital euro train left the station a long time ago with funding already secured and company being hired to build the required infrastructure a it stand now legislation is to be finalized in q and only in q will the decision on the digital euro be formally approd note that by then the design will be finished the design choice of the digital euroin the ecb published their report on the digital euro it see the future euro a a safe digital asset with advanced functionality and with profound implication for key area of central banking for the broader economic and financial system and ultimately for the life of european citizen the digital euro would be first of all another way to supply euro conrtible at par with other form of the euro a digital euro will be a liability of the eurosystem and therefore by definition risk free central bank money programmabilitythe digital euro should keep pace with state of the art technology at all time in order to best address the need of the market among required attribute are usability connience speed cost efficiency and programmability it should be made available through front end solution throughout the entire euro area and should be inter operable with private payment solution programmability is going to be required for a number of desired feature there are going to be control on how much money can be exchanged between different form of the euro different interest rate on different form of the euro and limit on what one can hold and or transact in crisis situation there will likely be a maximum amount of cbdc which can be held by one person at no additional cost in term of monetary policy the digital euro should be remunerated at interest rate s that the central bank can modify or time and with different interest rate applied in different case to get an idea of how much digital euro each account owner is allowed to own before being faced with restricti measure such a negati interest rate the dutch central bank suggests that euro should be enough for most dutch citizen a it represents one month s living expense and a financial buffer for unforeseen expense next to the account feature there is work being e on special payment instruction such a payment e between machine in short the digital euro is going to be programmable and not in a way that impros financial freedom account based access and the digital identitythe bi report taught u that central bank can issue a token or an account based system the ecb indeed discus both a possible option a pure bearer token system a exemplified by regular crypto currency would take away the control of the ecb thus according to the ecb such a system can only be allowed when both user are uniquely identified for exle with biometrics e g fingerprint and iris recognition the account based system on the other hand would be operated in the same way a the current banking system this is the preferred system of the ecb where they operate the back end while existing supervised intermediary operate the front end a we see shortly financial service provider ha already been hired to build this system a we speak the infrastructure for the digital euro is being built along with an eu wide digital id this digital id gorned by the eidas regulation aim to help business citizen and public authority carry out electronic interaction this digital id will contain your relevant data such a name address biometrics drir s licence medical data and will be used to facilitate transaction open bank account online shopping financial service such a insurance and god know what else this digital id wa approd in early december but like the cbdc wa already being built and funded long before that central or decentralized controlthe ecb s report repeat the bi s option of having a decentralized settlement system hower the ecb is not going for this model they state that the central bank will control the back end and ha control or all the unit that are to be created other possible featuresother design option are discussed such a the possibility for hardware wearable virtual card with additional feature such a shorter expiration date and spending limit and a pan european merchant solution privacy only for low value transaction the abo statement is from a more recent letter by fabio panetta the driving force behind the digital euro according to him the ecb will explore if they can allow some anonymity in the system the ecb is addressing privacy in response to a public consultation where the ecb asked european citizen what they thought of a european cbdc it receid an avalanche of negati response and privacy wa the most cited worry but the statement of the ecb on privacy are contradictory in public official tout it a an important feature but if you then look at their most recent internal presentation on privacy they explain that user anonymity is not a desirable feature a this would make it impossible to control the amount in circulation and to prent money laundering the truth is that a gradual shift to digital payment implies le privacy by default the ecb suggests that the digital euro should be designed so that the eurosystem should only be able to see the minimum transaction data hower they are settling the transaction and will need to know who is paying what to whom it is quite clear that privacy is not built into the system the ecb suggests that some privacy can be allowed for certain low value payment and offline functionality hower higher value transaction would remain subject to standard control lt programming the european cbdc ecb software packageon the th of december the ecb published a package for financial intermediary to start building application for the digital euro the publication contained cor letter confirming the design choice discussed abo but also a software package with the application programming interface api a set of defined rule that explain how the computer of bank are to communicate with those of the central bank source ecb website digital euro api package this package provides a programming standard for bank and payment provider that ser the general public it allow them to process payment digitally while the eurosystem settle the payment the ecb is testing a system where intermediary get to program different kind of transaction fi company ha been selected to build software integration on a settlement layer hosted by the ecb each will test a different type of transaction a an annex to the article one can download the code of the actual api from the source code a number of additional conclusion can be drawn about the model currently being pursued the digital euro will ha intermediary deal with client and the ecb ultimately settling all the transaction the intermediary creates the payment the eurosystem appro and then a callback confirms the detail of the transaction with detail on the time and date it settled despite the non stop bashing of bitcoin by the ecb the current proposal us the same technology utxo pub private signature and en the same security model secpk a bitcoin the ecb is literally creating a bitcoin rip off and may en be re using open source bitcoin code the ecb will respond to ery payment request with either settled or failed meaning that it ha the ultimate control or what payment do and do not get approval it is unclear what condition would result in a failed payment gin the large number of transaction the ecb will ha to process and the risk of running complex software at a settlement layer it is hard to imagine the ecb programming payment condition for specific case hower running a payment through a sanction list or a list with basic condition might be feasible moreor it seems likely that programming feature will be enforced at the layer abo the settlement layer for exle the ecb is working on a dedicated programmability platform layer between the settlement layer and the intermediary layer source ecb programmable payment in digital euro the documentation explains how intermediary create wallet address on behalf of their client it is only this address the ecb see the more sensiti account detail are kept with the financial service provider this is explained a safeguarding privacy hower a permanent record of all transaction is stored all the ecb need to do is match a name to each address and it see erything it is a of yet unclear how monetary and financial stability objectis are going to be coded into this system it also is not clear how the ecb aim to reconcile the contradiction of limit on account balance and their privacy goal the latest ecb progress update doe not alleviate these worry it state that for online payment the eurosystem itself will record transaction and perform associated rification task and it happens to be that online payment are the category of payment with the broadest set of high lel use case now ask yourself how large a share of payment in a digital currency will be e online in any case it is safe to assume there is not going to be real privacy in this system use with this design either the central bank or the intermediary know the identity of the user behind each transaction u federal reser design of the digital dollarcompared to the ecb the american central bank the federal reser is not a far advanced with designing their cbdc hower in january the fed did release their report money and payment the u s dollar in the age of digital transformation in the opening paragraph the fed repeat the familiar take that cbdcs are a different kind of money compared to existing form and state that in their opinion a cbdc is a digital liability of the federal reser that is widely available to the general public it would be the safest digital asset available to the general public with no associated credit or liquidity risk the report point to the fact that the federal reser act doe not allow direct federal reser account for individual the fed will therefore ha to adopt an intermediary model where the private sector would offer account or digital wallet to facilitate the management of cbdc holding and payment just a with the ecb you will not ha an account directly with the fed but although commercial bank and non bank would offer these service to individual the cbdc itself would be a liability of the federal reser further on the fed argues that a future cbdc should be intermediated widely transferable and identity rified while at the same time being privacy protected these are again contradicting objectis a a use case the fed note that gornments could use a cbdc to collect tax or make benefit payment directly to citizen additionally a cbdc could potentially be programmed to for exle delir payment at certain time again programmable money additionally a cbdc could potentially be used to carry out micro payment and streamline cross border payment by using new technology crucially the fed recap the risk unlimited use of cbdcs pose to the stability of the financial system a such the fed also proposes the variation of interest rate on different kind of money and limit on the amount an end user could hold moreor to prent a flight to safety it proposes limit to the amount a user could accumulate in a short period of time and last but not least the fed discus it monetary policy and the need to expand it balance sheet to accommodate cbdc growth part of this could be mitigated by shifting away from existing non reser liability yes the fed is suggesting withdrawing cash to make room for cbdcs new york fed testing of wholesale cbdcsthere were a number of recent headline reporting that the new york fed had started a week test of their first cdbc hower this project is mostly about exploring the concept of a wholesale cbdc this is a form of cbdc that is only used to settle the liability of regulated financial institution although interesting it doe not tell u much about the future of retail cbdcs which are the main subject of this report fednow payment systemfednow is another project under delopment by the fed that is sometimes confused with a cbdc this facility will enable individual and business to send instant payment between account while the idea of instant settlement reminds u of crypto currency what is settled are not central bank liability a such fednow is not a cbdc system lt conclusion the cbdc prison being builtcentral bank around the world ha started building cbdcs these need to be designed and each design ha consequence when looking at the design choice made so far we can see where thing are headed and it doesn t look good a of now no formal decision ha been made in the jurisdiction discussed regardless the eu s direction seems clear perhaps the u congress still ha a say in the future of money we shall see what we see in the work is a system where small group of unelected people get to appro all payment there will be no privacy it ha purposefully designed feature that control how much money you can hold and what kind of charge and negati interest rate apply a system of constant surillance and the centralization of sensiti information and then we han t en talked about all the other policy increasingly being enforced through the financial system such a a personal co budget or other social credit system the re directing of private resource towards public policy goal blended finance and the exclusion of political undesirable cbdcs replace cash with a kind of money you ner legally own you can directly be charged interest and fee on and cannot spend without permission do you want this source this post is larger than character so i remod the footnote from this post full list of footnote can be found here download this article in pdffor a pdf rsion of this article to store or share click tldr cbdcs are liability directly with the central bank they are a new kind of money next to cash and digital money currently held in private bank the bank of international settlement made an orview of all research into cbdcs it show that each design ha consequence the ecb ha chose for a design where intermediary deal with the client but the ecb settle all payment there is no real privacy in the system to ensure financial stability the ecb wish to maintain control or account balance apply variable interest charge and monetary policy stimulus the digital euro is in a far stage of delopment the federal reser act force the fed to go through intermediary a well the digital usd will be programmable and identity rified to ensure financial stability the fed wish to maintain control on interest charge and maximum account balance the fed also argues that cbdcs might ha to replace cash to maintain a healthy balance sheet the digital usd appears to not be in a far stage of delopment \n",

      "the fictitiousness of the consensus algorithm the failure of decentralization and the emergence of nonblockchain the content is ry long pre scrolling is recommended definitionthe blockchain is operated based on a plurality of node configured in a pp method countless transaction are submitted moment by moment from client all or the world towards countless node spread all or the world the result of these transaction are recorded on all node and in particular the content should be the same orall in order to realize this the rule that all node must follow is the consensus algorithm to describe it more conceptually it can be defined a a method in which a specific node is selected by a certain rule especially by the decentralization principle the selection and execution order of transaction is determined by the selected node and other good willed node independently rify and execute the content of individual transaction and store them in their database a such consensus algorithm can be clearly defined hower many people are misunderstanding this definition the subject of consensusthere is a serious misunderstanding about it of the general public misunderstands this point and most of the dapp programmer who ha not built the mainnet themsels are misunderstood or ambiguous this is en shown on ethereum's official website there is no understanding of the definition of the consensus algorithm mentioned abo or it is ambiguous the fundamental cause of this problem is the illusion about the subject of consensus in short en though the content of the transaction that's the authenticity of the author is not a subject of consensus it is often mistaken the only subject of the consensus are the selection of transaction and the order in which they are implemented a the content of the transaction exactly the authenticity of the author the transaction that a sends eth to b is electronically signed with a private key and deployed to the blockchain network the authenticity of the transaction creator is judged by each of all pp node it doesn't get help from anyone outside and it doesn't ask anyone outside hower most ordinary people and surprisingly many dapp programmer mistake the authenticity of the content or the author's authenticity a the subject of consensus hower this is not the subject of consensus but of anti consensus a famous pharase about this is the following do not trust rify a a result en if all other node in ethereum conspired to forge the transaction and store it in the database the honest node doe not care about it at all and rifies the transaction by itself and store it in it own database and new node joining afterwards will follow the honest node b selection and execution order of transactionsthese are the genuine subject of consensus no more no le not all transaction submitted to the blockchain are selected and the selected transaction are not executed in the order in which they are submitted this is use it is theoretically impossible a long a the concept of a block of finite capacity is premised therefore there arises a problem of deciding how many transaction to accept in one block and in what order to execute them it is the problem of the consensus algorithm and in itself this becomes the definition of it i selection of transactionsfor exle assuming that suddenly one billion transaction are pushed in one second it becomes impossible to put them in one block therefore we ha no choice but to choose some of them in this case most mainnets collect transaction in the order of high gas price and put them in block therefore en transaction submitted first in time may not be included in the block if the gas price is low they also run later than other transaction with high gas price en if they are contained in block for reference the existing centralized system sol this problem by creating a queue so en if a billion transaction suddenly hit in a second it can theoretically accept and process the whole transaction ii order of execution of transactionsthis is also usually determined based on gas price maybe all the mainnets are doing that and i' ner heard of that exception in this case it is natural that the possibility of manipulation occurs the answer of existing blockchain protocol to this are a follows code is law it mean that you are responsible for not checking the law in advance this is simply an irresponsible attitude for exle if an incompetent legislator incorrectly entered the amount of parking fine and added another zero the legislator is not at fault and you are an idiot for not checking the law this is the current state of the blockchain in the dao crisis the law wa entually forced to be revised now it should be law is code the order of execution of transaction must be in the order in which they were submitted at least they should try to do that hower the existing mainstream platform insist that the current gas price auction system is the right way offering only poor excuse of course eryone know that it is a lazism the birth of the block conceptas described abo the current consensus algorithm ha a fundamental problem nertheless the reason satoshi and buterin adopted this method wa to make centralized manipulation impossible in the selection and execution order of transaction that's they sacrificed the general principle of pre submissionism to pursue decentralization by the way in order to pursue decentralization in the satoshi sense the order of selection and execution of transaction must be determined by a node rather than a specific node hower if countless client submit their transaction to a myriad of node the unity of the orall database will be broken if the transaction are executed in the order submitted for each node therefore he wa forced to seek way to select and order transaction by any random node and to allow other node to accept them to this end it is needed to establish rule on who will make decision on selection and who will follow them a selected by a duly elected selection decision maker other node follow it and execute each transaction and store it in their own database thereby maintaining the orall database uniformity it wa the pow that satoshi came up with a a way to determine who ha the authority to make the abo selection decision that mean that the person who sol the high lel math problem the fastest will be gin the right to decide on the selection of transaction hower in order to do this you need time to sol math problem and during that period the transaction queue is accumulated at this point satoshi came up with the concept of the ry block it is the miner who succeeds in solving the math problem satoshi established a rule that the miner selects all or some of the transaction accumulated during the period of solving mathematical problem put them in one block and executes them and all other node follow the rule the block concept of blockchain wa born in this con limitation of the meaning of decentralization in blockchainas such the block concept emerged a a methodical element to make it impossible to manipulate in the adoption and order of execution of transaction it wa the best way within the limit of satoshi's intelligence the reason satoshi adopted the block concept wa of course to achie the idea of decentralization despite innumerable problem such a the execution delay of transaction during the block generation time the rersal of the transaction execution order and uncertainty of being selected in the block satoshi belied that decentralization would be guaranteed if a node wa selected from among the innumerable good willed node spread around the world and those node determined the selection and execution order of transaction and he thought that if only the decentralization wa guaranteed he could endure a number of problem caused by block generation if so it is necessary to calmly examine the advantage of the decentralization compared to the centralization system at the expense of such considerable cost for this it is good to make a comparison in other word it is assumed that there is one centralized node and that this node determines the selection and execution order of transaction and other node follow suit next the decentralization system is compared with this first there is no difference in the content of the transaction whether it is a centralization method or a decentralization method this is use forgery is impossible thus the transaction in which a transfer bitcoin to b work exactly the same on these two system and is also stored in the database in the same way it is also impossible for the centralization system operator to produce the abo manipulated transaction from the beginning and both system are the same in this respect hower there are difference between the two system in the selection of transaction and in determining the order of execution the problem is that it is necessary to examine whether the difference is essential or relati speaking from the conclusion the difference is only a relati difference and in particular in term of fairness that is prention of manipulation it can be said that there is nothing better than a centralized system in a decentralized system let's look at this in detail the manager x of the centralized system can arbitrarily manipulate the selection and execution order of the first transaction in which a transfer bitcoin to b and the second transaction in which a transfer bitcoin to c so if x hate b los c and a's current balance is bitcoin x can make the bitcoin which is normal to be transferred to b be transferred to c by manipulating the order of transaction or omitting the first transaction at all satoshi wa aware of the abo problem and a a countermeasure he studied how to empower random node operator to decide the selection and order of execution of transaction the result of the study wa mining and the concept that arose a an inevitable result of the mining wa the block finally at first it seemed that satoshi's idea could be realized without obstacle if there are innumerable node and an arbitrary or random node operator determines the selection and execution order of the transaction it can be admitted that virtually no one can manipulate it hower the reality did not go a satoshi thought the first typical situation wa the emergence of the mining king in china he wa able to exert the power of the operator of a centralized node to some extent based on the enormous hash power and most of all the critical scene wa the dao incident ethereum foundation and a series of sympathizer ha artificially manipulated the selection and execution order of the transaction to generate an artificial fork since then countless artificial fork ha been implemented in the blockchain ecosystem a a result satoshi's logic of decentralization ha virtually collapsed a an inevitable result the block concept ha now fallen into a relati rather than an absolute concept in the blockchain in fact en if it wa not the chinese mining king or the dao crisis there wa always a possibility of manipulation by arbitrary node operator that is the case when a node operator is preparing to manipulate at that time in case he succeeds in mining if he prepares manipulated code and allows the code to be executed when he succeeds in mining or is selected a a validator he can manipulate them for exle with simple code manipulation it is possible to change the selection and order of execution of transaction in a low rather than high order of gas price a such decentralization through mining and block wa originally an incomplete method it wa not a digital but an analog concept that is on a different lel from the absolute concept of the impossibility of forgery by electronic signature and this result applies equally to po whether the stake is large or small a node operator can manipulate the selection and execution order of transaction a long a he is selected a a validator but the problem 't end here it's time to ask a more fundamental question is it reasonable to fundamentally determine the selection and order of execution of transaction based on gas price to say the conclusion in advance it is a manipulation in itself it's nothing more and nothing le than to benefit someone who ha offered more bribe let's look at it in detail in general it is right to execute the transaction receid first for exle no matter how much remittance fee are offered to a bank it ner change the remittance order use it is a principle of nature to process remittance in chronological order there is no reason to treat this principle differently in blockchain therefore if the order is to be rersed a corresponding unavoidable reason must be presented satoshi's answer to this is a follows by extracting transaction in the order of higher gas price the platform can prent infinite repetiti attack this is not a reasonable presentation this is a simple security issue and a topic unrelated to decentralization that's it is not an issue to be considered in the stage of building the core of the blockchain that should be considered once the essential structure of the blockchain is completed in other word in the core stage it is right to complete the basic structure so that the transaction are executed in chronological order therefore the infinite repetition attack problem should be considered in the process of considering various secondary problem of the basic structure that ha been completed primarily in the process it is the right programming mindset to devise and install a new appropriate additional device separately also such a device is easily conceivable for exle you can find a lot of great method en at the lel of common sense such a conducting transaction in chronological order receiving cost in term of security rather than gas and returning them if there are no problem later unfortunately it is assumed that satoshi did not ha time to come up with such an idea a a result the gas cost were forcibly inserted into the core part of the blockchain under the wrong name that's the security cost were inserted under the name of gas cost the aftereffect of satoshi's decision on subsequent blockchains were sere in conclusion satoshi's decentralized method could not achie it original purpose the selection and execution order of transaction could be manipulated and more fundamentally determining them based on the gas price is just manipulation in itself the gas cost priority policy is an unusual manipulation against the common sense that the transaction receid first should be implemented first and the reason for that manipulation wa also poor in conclusion it is inevitable to raise fundamental question about satoshi's decentralization method that is the block method itself this is not just an issue for bitcoin but a problem for ethereum and all other blockchains disappearance of the blockif all transaction can continue from beginning to end without manipulation and the database can be stored equally on all node the purpose of the blockchain is achied a curious result emerges here that is the fact that the concept of a block is not necessary to achie that purpose in addition the fact that none of the existing blockchains achied the essential purpose of the blockchains mentioned abo perfectly at least satisfactorily make u surprised that mean that the block is a failed concept a shown by the comparison of the two system abo it cannot be guaranteed that the decentralized pp system of satoshi or ethereum ha special advantage or the centralized pp system instead by adopting a centralized system but strengthening the device that control the central main node to prent abuse of authority it is possible to make a more fair and unmanipulatable system than the existing decentralized system for exle a main node temporarily monopolizes the selection and execution of transaction and is forced to select and execute transaction in chronological order then the other node monitor it constantly and if it operates against principle disqualify it and appoint one of the other standby node a the main node in any case both centralized pp and decentralized pp cannot manipulate the content of a transaction that's both method already ha sold the byzantine general problem the remaining issue are of what to select and how to set execution order but rather a centralized system can operate them more fairly the transaction submited first is executed first and the gas cost may not be receid at last we come to a final conclusion the concept of the block is remod a long a the transaction are executed in the order submitted there is no reason to divide and put them in block this is no different from executing transaction in chronological order receid by bank or credit card company they no longer need the concept of block the concept of the block wa only satoshi's desperate measure and it is by no mean a logically necessary concept to achie the purpose of the block chain and the most important fact is that it is desirable to remo the concept of a block a much a possible therefore it come to the conclusion that the block concept will entually disappear the only thing that remains is the transaction chain now the blockchain must be renamed the transaction chain which will revolutionize the blockchain ecosystem the appearance of nonblockchainat least it is possible to remo the concept of block while maintaining the current lel of fairness of decentralization in bitcoin or ethereum more precisely it mean that there are theoretically infinite way to eliminate the concept of the block to impro the selection and execution order of transaction while securing fairness beyond the current lel of the fairness of decentralization in bitcoin or ethereum then what will the consensus algorithm look like if the block concept is actually remod first of all the chain is made up of only transaction this transaction chain also ha no fear of forgery at least in the content of the transaction a long a pp is the premise there is no fear of forgery or falsification of the content of a transaction whether it is on a centralized or decentralized system if so the only thing left is the selection and order of transaction who will decide them this mean going back to the point when satoshi created bitcoin based on experience or the past year satoshi ha failed on this issue for now therefore we must return to satoshi's initial starting point en if we 't like that and we ha to start or from scratch what need to be obserd here is one thing and that is enough that's the lel of fairness must be abo the current lel of bitcoin or ethereum complete fairness is impossible it's not impossible in theory but it's practically impossible unless an innovati new technology like rsa emerges the easiest thing to think about is appointing a main node in appointing the main node the status may be endowed permanently or only temporarily the most appropriate answer will be somewhere in the middle of the two it is virtually impossible to appoint and replace the main node only temporarily i e only once for each transaction satoshi wa confronted with this ry problem at that time satoshi imagined the concept of block and from this blockchain wa born and year later it wa confirmed that the concept of block wa a failure in this case the most common sense that can be thought of is to appoint a main node under a certain standard and constantly monitor it a a method you may use the platform's own code or you may use a smartcontract and if manipulation or laziness of the main node is detected a method of replacing the main node automatically or by poll is introduced en at this lel the fairness is not inferior to the former chinese mining king or specific foundation led artificial fork creation abo all this method ha the advantage of being able to set the operating standard in advance in a smartcontract a a result arbitrary fork generation is fundamentally blocked this is use the fork generation principle itself that other node follow the longest blockchain ha been remod then it can be said that it is relatily more fair than the existing decentralization system in the end that can be called proof of democracy pod decentralization which is le fair than pod is no longer decentralized entually the religion of decentralization also collapse many people still belie in this myth it is superstition use there is no technical basis the trustlessness ha a technical basis called a electronic signature hower there is no such definite technique for the permissionlessness an essential element of decentralization a demonstrated abo the block failed the decentralization ha failed in both theoretical and practical way therefore in this situation calling for decentralization is nothing more than calling for it a a simple ideology it is no more than a cry for th century anarchism decentralization without technical support is nothing more than a mere cry of ideology in reality pow and po are also fundamentally operated under the control of pod they are no longer decentralized thing let's look more specifically pow is not a mining certification method but a mining manipulation method a can be seen from china's mining king po is also only a method that can be manipulated by stakeholder there is currently no technology or method to prent the manipulation the dao crisis and the numerous fork that ha been conniently attempted since then only pro that the blockchain is accepting democracy it ultimate bastion that is it may be seen that the pow or po is only a kind of pod at present in other word all existing consensus algorithm are pod pure decentralization independent of democracy doe not currently exist therefore the method of selection and ordering of transaction can only be explored based on pod at present advantage of nonblockchain satoshi's block ended in failure hower it ha since become the standard for all blockchains most blockchains fundamentally do not deviate from satoshi's basic framework entually all of them disappear or remain only for museum use personally bitcoin's block will survi forer on the other hand ethereum is ry unstable there is absolutely no reason to maintain the block concept in the ethereum c ethereum's attempt to maintain the current block concept is an obvious long term impossibility nonblockchain ha many advantage once you can stick to the principle that is transaction may be executed in the order of reception or submission a in the previous exle if the tree method with the main node a the top is applied transaction can be executed in the order receid by the main node furthermore all transaction can be accepted without omission this is the same a the queue concept in a general computer o there is nothing special the nonblockchain would normally adopt a tree structure of course in preliminary the horizontal pp method of the current blockchain may be adopted a an auxiliary method it depends on the mainnet deloper's choice anyway if the tree structure is adopted it can boast the fastest speed theoretically there can no longer be a rapid structure the nonblockchain doe not require a concept such a gas price to determine eligibility to be included in a block use the concept of a block doe not exist in the first place it is enough to accept and implement in fact the gas cost of existing blockchains are virtually irrelevant to the node's operating cost this is use the execution of transaction and the storage of data are performed in all node but the gas cost are only probabilistically paid to miner or validators to be exact gas cost should be distributed fairly to all node in this respect the existing gas cost system is extremely unreasonable instead it is desirable to institutionalize a separate method of payment of operating expense newly and that is possible but that will not be specifically mentioned here the real purpose of existing blockchains collecting gas cost is not for operating expense the mining reward are sufficient to pay operating expense in fact the real purpose of the gas cost wa security cost this is being confessed by ethereum's official site in short gas fee help keep the ethereum network secure by requiring a fee for ery computation executed on the network we prent bad actor from spamming the network the nonblockchain collect security cost not gas cost if malicious intent is not positily recognized due to the review the collected gas cost will be returned in this way the security cost may be set high enough without resistance entually by returning the gas cost they become zero a described abo the advantage of the nonblockchain are considerable and there are no theoretical or practical obstacle to it adoption so of course the existing block concept must be discarded and a system consisting only of a pure transaction chain will inevitably emerge the nonblockchain consensus algorithm is bound to be pod for the time being for now we ha no choice but to wait for the emergence of consensus algorithm that can achie decentralization in the true sense by a genius who will appear someday until then it will only be in the form of a pod conclusionthe block wa just satoshi's impromptu idea the necessity for hash to be contiguous is only between transaction not between block a a result the name of the blockchain itself is meaningless the blockchain is only one method proposed by satoshi to realize the ideology of the transactionchain the block is not the truth the block concept wa only one of the myriad way to realize the transactionchain and it ha now reached the point of disposal the byzantine general problem wa not sold by satoshi but wa just a problem that had already been sold by cryptography it wa the electronic signature looking inside the blockchain at the current stage there are no particularly remarkable technology other than the electronic signature other technology are only those that ha already existed or can be deloped by ordinary programmer it is absurd to try to achie decentralization with only such poor equipment in other word the crypto world at this stage doe not ha the ability to realize the ideal of blockchain a an inevitable result the consensus algorithm cannot go beyond pod this is the reality of today's blockchain but the spirit of commercialism want to hide these limitation on the other hand glorify the block to this end they feature the emperor's new clothes the representati clothes are ethereum's future plan the complexity of this plan is indescribable the complexity wa all caused by the concept of the block these are temporary complication that will all disappear when the block concept is remod or at least a fundamental platform that heals the problem appears for the time being of course they are successful in dazzling people \n",

Take a look at the ` --datadir.ancient` option. The most common use of this is to put the blockchain (all the historical blocks) on an HDD so that you only need to store the state and a bit of extra gubbins on SSD. I'm not sure where the state snapshots generated by an archive node go, but that might work for you. That way you may only need to buy a 1TB or 2TB SSD, then use an HDD for your monster archive.\\n\\nPS. At the risk of being that guy there really aren't a lot of cases where running an archive node (the 40TB thing) is the best option. You can get all the transactions from just a regular node on a 2TB SSD or a 1TB SSD + a 1TB HDD. For most cases it's probably better to run you own script indexing each block into a database (maybe with The Graph which puts it in PostgreSQL) designed for querying whatever it is that you're trying to query.\",\n",

Using RAID 0 or RAID 10 could give you enough of a performance boost to make it feasible, but this isn't something I've tried personally and I'm not sure if statistics exist to show that this would work before actually trying it. \\n\\nYou might be able to try one of the minority clients like Erigon- I've heard that they've managed to greatly improve the archive node architecture and make it much easier to run. If you have a spare 2TB HDD, you could just try syncing Erigon (make sure you have lots of RAM) and see where it gets you. If it works, then you can scale up and do an archive node.\",\n",

ethereum,"# …The Truth About CBDCs… Ominous Design Revealed… A Digital Prison Is Being Built in the Shadows…

**Massive overreach of Central Banks underway.They are designing a new kind of money allowing them to:**

* Establish centralized settlement of ALL payments…
* Tie digital identities to all transactions and record them on a central bank ledger forever…
* Force built-in features such as limits on how much CBDC you can have in your account, negative interest rates, account charges in line with regulatory objectives, and caps on conversions and spending…
* Create “money” that is traceable, programmable, taxable, and subject to the monetary whims of central planners…
* Stamp out spending without permission and slowly phase out cash…

The war on money continues. The aim: to replace cash with a system of centralized control over ALL transactions and account balances.

This report explains exactly what to expect from Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs); it looks at the possible design options, what central banks have decided so far, and the likely outcomes.

The ugly conclusion is that CBDCs are a new form of currency that allows a small group of unelected people control over what we can, and cannot do with our own money…

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;What is Going On?_

A lot has been said and written about CBDCs; most was speculation. But now, evidence emerges of what is being built.

Given that our financial system is complex, one cannot just click a button and introduce a CBDC. As of now, much work has already been done, and much is still to be done.

This report traces the historical path of the development of CBDCs. We start with looking at what CBDCs are. Then we look at why we need them, as explained by the Bank of International Settlements (**BIS**).

Next, we look at how CBDCs are designed. As the central regulator of central banks, the BIS made an inventory of all the different design options for CBDCs. It also provided an honest account of the potential benefits and downsides of those choices. With this knowledge, we can analyze the design choices made so far.

We observe how the European Central Bank (**ECB**) is going “full steam ahead” with their CBDC. We come to the shocking discovery that the most important design choices have already been made, and that there have even been companies hired to start programming…

Next, we analyze what is happening in the US. The US Federal Reserve (FED) is not as far advanced with their CBDC as the ECB. However, their frank report reveals that their CBDC design choices result in similar control mechanisms as that of the ECB—and it even exposes possible sinister motives…

To put it bluntly, what central banks are choosing for design so far tells us all we need to know about where this is heading. Authorities are downplaying what is going on and pretending that all is open for debate and subjected to the democratic process. But the designs they are secretly pushing forward open the door to the dystopian future we all fear…

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;What Are Central Bank Digital Currencies?_

Before we can continue, we have to define CBDCs; after all, we already have digital money. But CBDCs and what we currently use as digital money are VERY different things.

What we currently refer to as digital money is not issued by the central bank. In the modern financial system, the central bank only creates money in the form of cash (bills and coins), and cash deposits with banks. All other money is created by private banks.

That’s right: the digital money currently in use is created by private institutions. The digital units in your bank account are issued by a PRIVATE bank. CBDCs, on the contrary, are digital PUBLIC money, issued by the central bank. CBDCs are a totally new kind of money―with many new features.

To summarize, we go from two types, to three types of retail money:

1. Cash (public money = current)
2. Digital money (private money = current)
3. CBDC (public money = new)

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: ECB, Digital euro – our future money](https://preview.redd.it/nllt4m6u8naa1.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f51c67177c3bb1a51d2f49512dd924ba6ff34b6)

Note that CBDCs are essentially just different forms of the same currency. One unit of cash is on par with one unit of CBDC; they are interchangeable. For reasons explained later, these forms of money are also intended to exist alongside each other for the foreseeable future.

To summarize: central banks are issuing a new version of money which is a liability of the central bank. As such, CBDCs are not just another form of digital money. As PUBLIC money, they are more comparable to the other form of public money: cash.

This begs the question: why do we need an addition/replacement for cash?

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Why Do We Need CBDCs? (According to Central Banks)_

There is much debate on why CBDCs are being rolled out. To avoid speculation, we will stick with what the BIS has said about why we need CBDCs. This approach helps us to understand the decisions central banks have taken, and what the logical outcome will be…

## Financial Stability and the Reduced Role of Public Money

Over the past few years, cash has become less popular. This presents a problem because, as shown, cash is currently the only form of public money used by the public (retail). And so when cash is phased out, so is public money.

A principal concern of central banks is that if, in the future, cash were no longer widely accepted or available, a severe financial crisis in the private financial system might create further havoc by disrupting day-to-day business and retail transactions.**1)** CBDCs would be a way to keep the economy functioning.

## Monetary Policy

Another benefit of CBDCs touted by the BIS is that they allow for a more direct influence on monetary policy. Arguments for issuing a CBDC include potential “strengthening of the pass-through of the policy rate” to money markets and deposit rates, and helping to “alleviate the zero (or effective) lower bound constraint.”**2)** The BIS also argues for direct stimulus. Let’s take a look at each benefit…

Strengthening of the pass-through of the policy rate means more control over the interest rates charged throughout the financial system. Central banks wish to bypass private banks and set rates directly. From the moment that households consider a CBDC to be an alternative to commercial bank deposits, banks will have less scope for independently setting the interest rate on deposits of the general public.**3)**

The zero lower bound describes the limit of negative interest rates. In short, in an environment of increasingly lower interest rates on bank accounts, people might pull their money out of the bank. It is, after all, better to hold cash than money in an account that charges (deep) negative interest rates.

To address this issue, the IMF circulated a paper, called “Breaking Through the Zero Lower Bound.”**4)** It explores the idea of having different interest rates for different forms of money. For example, an additional interest rate on cash can very easily be charged on private banks through what is known as the “cash window” at the central bank. The central bank charges the regular banks for the use of cash, and the banks then charge the users through extra fees on withdrawals and deposits. This way, the use of cash can be made more expensive than digital forms of money.**5)**

This mechanism can be applied to steer the use of different forms of money, and even be a stepping stone on the road to a cashless society.**6)** As you’ll see later, the IMF’s idea of different interest rates for different kinds of money is vigorously embraced by central banks.

For example, the Nigerian central bank used this idea to restrict cash shortly after introducing their unpopular CBDC.**7)**

And finally, according to the BIS, CBDCs could facilitate a more direct distribution of fiscal stimulus to those members of the general public who need it. This could make such policies more effective than general helicopter money or distribution through the indirect and imperfect banking channels which have been used in the past.**8)**

## Financial Inclusion

Another buzzword central banks like to use is financial inclusion. With a CBDC, everyone could have access to basic financial services. This would be especially interesting for people not served by the current financial system, which is a situation more prevalent outside the developed world.

But as always, like much else in the diversity and inclusion agenda, these rosy goals are mostly a facade. One of the most prominent organisations behind financial inclusion is the United Nations, for whom the financial inclusion agenda allows the unlocking of \*“public and private resources”\***9)** to fund their “Sustainable Development Goals.”**10)** The UN, in turn, coordinates its policies through the “Better Than Cash Alliance”,**11)** an NGO acting as a front for the interests of, among others, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Citi Bank, MasterCard and Visa Inc.**12)**

In this light, inclusive finance can be seen as the conversion of the unbanked into tax and debt serfs, who pay transaction fees and serve as collateral for the financial system.

## Financial innovation

The BIS is discussing all sorts of other features, all made possible by the idea of “programmable money.” As we will see, most of this innovation is in the interests of central banks.

One of the promised benefits of CBDCs is that it can make international payments much more efficient and transparent. Because these kinds of liabilities are being built from scratch, CBDCs are billed as offering a unique opportunity to facilitate easier cross-border payments.**13)**

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;CBDC Design Choices_

Before we continue, it is important to note that there have been few (official) decisions made as to how to move forward. The introduction of a CBDC requires significant work, and central banks are moving slowly in order not to break anything.

In this next section, we look at the overviews the BIS has made on designing CBDCs. Lots of research has been done across academia, financial institutions and the central banks; and the BIS has created a nice summary of the design options. It also reveals what the benefits and downsides of these design choices are. With this knowledge, we can then look at the design decisions that have already been made by the ECB and FED, and hence conclude what is happening behind the scenes.

## Tokens vs Identity based

First of all, a choice has to be made as to whether the CBDC is to be token-based, or tied to an identity through an account. According to the BIS, it has to be either one or the other.

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: BIS Quarterly Review - March 2020](https://preview.redd.it/ihzthl1x8naa1.png?width=798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aaa76a447727bc8e88168b4101c32f9bb6d151b)

A token-based system would work like other crypto-currencies; those with the private keys can spend the money. But the drawbacks, according to the BIS, are severe. One is the high risk of losing funds if end users fail to keep their private key secret. Furthermore, it would be challenging to design an effective regulatory framework for such a system. Law enforcement agencies would run into difficulties when seeking to identify claim owners or follow money flows, just as with cash or bearer securities.**14)** In addition, a token system would nullify the central bank objectives discussed above.

The other option is that the use and ownership of a CBDC is accessible through an account tied to an identity, similar to how the current banking system operates. To make this happen, the BIS calls for “strong” identities for all account holders; where each individual is tied to one identifier across the entire payment system.**15)**

The disadvantages of an account-based system, according to a 2018 paper of the BIS, are that you cannot have anonymity vis-a-vis the central bank, and there cannot be private peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary as is currently possible with cash \[see graph\].**16)**

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: BIS - Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures - CBDCs \(2018\)](https://preview.redd.it/1pxpyuw09naa1.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf5c3c5467472b281c27bfac36e393a765e42b4b)

## Direct or indirect liabilities?

The next question: should people have an account directly with the central bank, or through intermediary financial institutions? Here, the considerations are not just about what is desirable, but also what is practically feasible.

Currently, central banks simply do not have the infrastructure to hold accounts for hundreds of millions of citizens. In addition, there are regulatory obligations, such as KYC and customer due diligence, that central banks do not have the infrastructure and mandates for.**17)**

The most logical outcome would be for central banks to use the existing financial companies to roll out CBDCs. On a more technical level the question then becomes: is the CBDC to be a liability on the balance sheet of the central bank, or on the balance sheet of a financial intermediary? With the latter option, the CBDC would be an indirect liability of the central bank, also known as a “synthetic CBDC.” The BIS does not like this idea.**18)**

## Centralized vs Decentralized

Another choice needs to be made between using a decentralized settlement system, or a centralized one.

Firstly, for regulators, “decentralized” does not mean the same thing as it does to the industry; they see it as a few regulated entities validating the settlement system.**19)** Moreover, regular consensus mechanisms have too much overhead and are too slow for the large number of transactions needed.**20)**

An issue the BIS has with a decentralized CBDC is that it means that a decentralized network makes adjustments to the balance sheet of the central bank. This increases the risks to the system (according to the BIS).**21)**

## Programmability

One of the main questions a central bank has to ask itself is whether it is going to create programmable money. What is programmable money? The US Federal Reserve provides a good definition:

“a digital form of money and a mechanism for specifying the automated behavior of that money through a computer program (this mechanism is termed “programmability” in this note).”**22)**

Across the pond, in individual countries within the EU, the need for programmable money is being debated. However, as you will see in the following sections, programmability is an essential part of CBDCs. The ECB has even already released an API for institutions to start programming!

## Financial Stability Requirements

The fact that CBDCs are going to be exchangeable for digital currencies results in some MAJOR risks to the financial system. After all, CBDCs make it easy to pull your money out of a private institution (risk), and deposit it with the central bank (no risk).

If CBDCs could be freely traded, the moment rumors spread that a bank is having issues, all account holders will convert their account balances to CBDCs guaranteed by the central bank. You could have instant bank runs, and collapses in the financial system would happen as quickly as they do in the crypto space.

In addition, adding CBDCs increases the total amount of money in circulation, creates even more inflation at a time when people are already having problems paying their bills.

As a result, any CBDC needs a built-in mechanism to limit the amount of total CBDC that can be issued, and limit how much can be exchanged for digital currency. In short, a programmable aspect of the CBDC has to come into play. We will see later how both the ECB and Fed are already committed to using financial stability as an excuse to take full control over how CBDCs can be held, charged, and exchanged.

## Monetary Policy

One of the main activities of central banks over the last decade has been trying to manage the economy through monetary policy. Up until now, these interventions have not always been effective in kick-starting the economy. CBDCs can give the central banks, when properly designed, much more direct tools for implementing monetary policy.

## Privacy

Privacy is one of the main concerns of regulators. Or at least, it is the main concern for their potential users. So this issue has to be addressed in the design of the coin.

It is worth noting that privacy means something different for central bankers and for end users. In the crypto space, it means that the technology makes it impossible for anyone to track your purchases. From the point of view of central banks, privacy means that the organisations monitoring and facilitating your payments are under constraints as to what they can and have to do with your data.**23)**

Moreover, central banks compare the privacy of CBDCs with data-mining private financial service companies, and with transactions being done on public blockchains. They argue that in that light, public institutions are better at safeguarding privacy.**24)**

For the design of a CBDC, a central bank has to make a decision as to what level of privacy a coin will have, taking into account that full privacy is considered incompatible with other policy objectives such as KYC and AML compliance. As we will see, there are strong indications that privacy (as it is understood by the crypto industry) is not going to be built into the CBDC system.

## Interoperability

Central banks will have to make certain design choices such as whether foreigners are to be able to hold accounts with the central bank, or if there is to be some sort of exchange facility, perhaps similar to what the crypto industry calls an atomic swap.

A coordinated CBDC design effort could take a clean-slate perspective and incorporate cross-border payment options right from the start.**25)**

## Private vs public chain

On a final note, investors in existing blockchains, such as XLM or XRP, have been publicly claiming that CBDCs will be built with their chain as the base layer. This is simply NOT going to happen.

As previously mentioned, CBDCs are liabilities on the balance sheet of the central bank. There is no way that they are going to base this on an existing blockchain, because it would mean they would have to take full control over the network.

Now that we understand the different design choices available, we can look behind the scenes at how central banks are applying them―starting with the ECB!

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;The Digital Euro; ECB Design Choices_

To understand the process of the creation of the digital Euro, we have to recap how the EU works. This is well described by Todd Huizinga, a former American diplomat to the EU. He explains in detail that the EU is run by elites who wish to create an “ever closer union,” regardless of the desires of the populations of individual EU countries.**26)**)

As a result, the EU has created a culture where policies are presented as still being debated and subject to democratic principles, whilst in fact, behind closed doors, the direction is being agreed upon in backroom deals.

The same seems to apply to the EU’s CBDC, the digital Euro. The design and building of the digital Euro is at an advanced stage, while officially nothing has been decided.

The reality however is that the issuing of the Euro, and logically also the design of the digital Euro, is delegated to the European Central banking system.**27)** And as you will see in the remainder of this section, the digital Euro train left the station a long time ago, with funding already secured and companies being hired to build the required infrastructure.

As it stands now, legislation is to be finalized in Q1 2023. And only in Q3 2023 will the decision on the digital Euro be formally approved (note that by then the design will be finished).**28)**

## The design choices of the digital Euro

In 2020 the ECB published their “Report on the digital Euro.”**29)** It sees the future Euro as a “safe digital asset with advanced functionalities”**30)** and with “profound implications for key areas of central banking, for the broader economic and financial system, and, ultimately, for the life of European citizens”**31)**

The digital Euro would be first of all another way to supply Euros, convertible at par with other forms of the Euro. A digital Euro will be a liability of the Eurosystem and therefore by definition risk-free central bank money.**32)**

## Programmability

The digital Euro should keep pace with state-of-the-art technology at all times in order to best address the needs of the market. Among required attributes are: usability, convenience, speed, cost efficiency and programmability. It should be made available through front-end solutions throughout the entire Euro area and should be inter-operable with private payment solutions.**33)**

Programmability is going to be required for a number of desired features. There are going to be controls on how much money can be exchanged between different forms of the Euro,**34)** different interest rates on different forms of the Euro, and limits on what one can hold and/or transact in crisis situations.**35)** There will likely be a maximum amount of CBDC which can be held by one person at no additional cost.**36)** In terms of monetary policy, the digital Euro should be remunerated at interest rate(s) that the central bank can modify over time,**37)** and with different interest rates applied in different cases.**38)**

To get an idea of how much digital Euros each account owner is allowed to own before being faced with restrictive measures (such as negative interest rates), the Dutch central bank suggests that 3.000-4.000 Euro should be enough for most Dutch citizens, as it represents one month’s living expenses and a financial buffer for unforeseen expenses(!).**39)**

Next to the account features, there is work being done on special payment instructions, such as payments done between machines.**40)** In short, the digital Euro is going to be programmable, and not in a way that improves financial freedom.

## Account Based Access and the Digital Identity

The BIS report taught us that central banks can issue a token or an account based system. The ECB, indeed, discusses both as possible options.\*\*41)\*\*A pure bearer (token) system, as exemplified by regular crypto currencies, would take away the control of the ECB. Thus, according to the ECB, such a system can only be allowed when both users are uniquely identified, for example with biometrics, e.g. fingerprint and iris recognition.**42)**

The account-based system, on the other hand, would be operated in the same way as the current banking system. This is the preferred system of the ECB, where they operate the back-end while (existing) supervised intermediaries operate the front-end.**43)** As we see shortly, financial service providers have already been hired to build this system.

As we speak, the infrastructure for the digital Euro is being built, along with an EU-wide digital ID. This digital ID, governed by the eIDAS Regulation,**44)** aims to help business, citizens and public authorities carry out electronic interactions. This digital ID will contain your relevant data, such as name, address, biometrics, driver’s licence, medical data, and will be used to facilitate transactions, open bank accounts, (online) shopping, financial services (such as insurance) and God knows what else. This digital ID was approved in early December 2022 (but, like the CBDC, was already being built and funded long before that).

## Central or Decentralized Control

The ECB’s 2020 report repeats the BIS’s options of having a decentralized settlement system. However, the ECB is not going for this model; they state that the central bank will control the back-end, and has control over all the units that are to be created.**45)**

## Other Possible Features

Other design options are discussed, such as the possibility for hardware “wearables”,**46)** virtual cards with additional features such as shorter expiration date and spending limits, and a pan-European merchant solution.**47)**

## Privacy only for “low-value transactions”

The above statement is from a more recent letter by Fabio Panetta, the driving force behind the digital Euro. According to him, the ECB will explore if they can “allow” some anonymity in the system.**48)**

The ECB is addressing privacy in response to a public consultation where the ECB asked European citizens what they thought of a European CBDC. It received an avalanche of negative responses, and privacy was the most cited worry.**49)**

But the statements of the ECB on privacy are contradictory. In public, officials tout it as an important feature. But if you then look at their most recent internal presentation on privacy they explain that “user anonymity is not a desirable feature, as this would make it impossible to control the amount in circulation and to prevent money laundering.”**50)**

The truth is that a gradual shift to digital payments implies “less privacy by default.” The ECB suggests that the digital Euro should be designed so that the Eurosystem should only be able to see the “minimum transaction data.”**51)** However, they are settling the transaction and will need to know who is paying what to whom. It is quite clear that privacy is not built into the system.

The ECB suggests that some privacy can be allowed for certain “low-value payments” and “offline functionality.” However, “higher-value transactions would remain subject to standard controls.”**52)**

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Programming the European CBDC: ECB Software Package_

On the 7th of December 2022, the ECB published a package for financial intermediaries to start building applications for the digital Euro.

The publication contained cover letters confirming the design choices discussed above, but also a software package with the Application Programming Interface (API), a set of defined rules that explain how the computers of banks are to communicate with those of the central bank.**53)**

[Source: ECB Website, Digital Euro API package](https://preview.redd.it/e105ovs59naa1.png?width=804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=420fe43a79fdf745b8726f7642ebb4cb4b173ed7)

This package provides a programming standard for banks and payment providers that serve the general public; it allow them to process payments digitally, while the Eurosystem settles the payments.

The ECB is testing a system where intermediaries get to program different kinds of transactions. Five companies have been selected to build software integrations on a settlement layer hosted by the ECB. Each will test a different type of transaction.**54)**

As an Annex to the article, one can download the code of the actual API.**55)** From the source code, a number of additional conclusions can be drawn about the model currently being pursued:

* The digital Euro will have intermediaries deal with clients, and the ECB ultimately settling all the transactions. The intermediary creates the payment, the Eurosystem approves, and then a callback confirms the details of the transaction, with details on the time and date it settled.
* Despite the non-stop bashing of Bitcoin by the ECB, the current proposal uses the same technology (UTXO, pub/private signatures) and even the same security model (secp256k1) as Bitcoin. The ECB is literally creating a Bitcoin rip-off and may even be re-using open source Bitcoin code…
* The ECB will respond to every payment request with either “SETTLED” or “FAILED.” Meaning that it has the ultimate control over what payments do and do not get approval. It is unclear what conditions would result in a failed payment.  
Given the large number of transactions the ECB will have to process, and the risk of running complex software at a settlement layer, it is hard to imagine the ECB programming payment conditions for specific cases.  
However, running a payment through a sanctions list, or a list with basic conditions might be feasible. Moreover, it seems likely that programming features will be enforced at the layers above the settlement layer. For example, the ECB is working on a “Dedicated programmability platform layer” between the settlement layer and the intermediary layers.**56)**

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: ECB, Programmable payments in digital euro](https://preview.redd.it/prt02rza9naa1.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9975507329d2f4d8715a24eedde14b69ac888a6)

* The documentation explains how intermediaries create wallet addresses on behalf of their clients. It is only this address the ECB sees. The more sensitive account details are kept with the financial service provider. This is explained as safeguarding privacy. However, a permanent record of all transactions is stored. All the ECB needs to do is match a name to each address, and it sees everything.

It is as of yet unclear how monetary and financial stability objectives are going to be coded into this system. It also is not clear how the ECB aims to reconcile the contradiction of limits on account balance and their privacy goals.

The latest ECB progress update does not alleviate these worries; it states that for online payments the Eurosystem itself will record transactions AND perform associated verification tasks.**57)** And it happens to be that online payments are the category of payments with “the broadest set of high-level use cases.”**58)**

Now ask yourself: how large a share of payments in a digital currency will be done “online?”

In any case, it is safe to assume there is not going to be real privacy in this system, because with this design either the central bank or the intermediary knows the identity of the users behind each transaction.

&amp;#x200B;

## US Federal Reserve Design of the Digital Dollar_

Compared to the ECB, the American Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, is not as far advanced with designing their CBDC. However, in January 2022, the Fed did release their report “Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation.”**59)**

In the opening paragraphs, the FED repeats the familiar take that CBDCs are a different kind of money compared to existing forms, and states that in their opinion a CBDC is a “digital liability of the Federal Reserve that is widely available to the general public.” It would be the “safest digital asset available to the general public, with no associated credit or liquidity risk.”**60)**

The report points to the fact that the Federal Reserve Act does not allow direct Federal Reserve accounts for individuals. The FED will therefore have to adopt an intermediary model where the private sector would offer accounts or digital wallets to facilitate the management of CBDC holdings and payments. Just as with the ECB, you will NOT have an account directly with the FED. But although commercial banks and non-banks would offer these services to individuals, the CBDC itself would be a liability of the Federal Reserve.**61)**

Further on, the FED argues that a future CBDC should be intermediated, widely transferable, and identity-verified, while at the same time being privacy protected.**62)** These are, again, contradicting objectives.

As a use case, the FED notes that governments could use a CBDC to collect taxes or make benefit payments directly to citizens. Additionally, a CBDC could potentially be programmed to, for example, deliver payments at certain times.**63)** Again, programmable money.

Additionally, a CBDC could potentially be used to carry out micro-payments, and streamline cross-border payments by using new technologies.**64)**

Crucially, the FED recaps the risk unlimited use of CBDCs poses to the stability of the financial system. As such, the FED also proposes the variation of interest rates on different kinds of money and limits on the amount an end user could hold.**65)** Moreover, to prevent a flight to safety, it proposes limits to the amount a user could accumulate in a short period of time.**66)**

And last, but not least, the FED discusses its monetary policy and the need to expand its balance sheet to accommodate CBDC growth. Part of this could be mitigated by shifting away from existing “non reserve liabilities.”**67)**

…Yes, the FED is suggesting withdrawing cash to make room for CBDCs…

## New York Fed Testing of Wholesale CBDCs

There were a number of recent headlines reporting that the New York Fed had started a 12-week test of their first CDBC.**68)** However, this project is mostly about exploring the concept of a “wholesale CBDC.” This is a form of CBDC that is only used to settle the liabilities of regulated financial institutions. Although interesting, it does not tell us much about the future of retail CBDCs which are the main subject of this report.

## Fednow Payment System

Fednow is another project under development by the FED that is sometimes confused with a CBDC. This facility will enable individuals and businesses to send instant payments between accounts.**69)** While the idea of instant settlement reminds us of crypto currency, what is settled are not central bank liabilities. As such, Fednow is not a CBDC system.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Conclusion: The CBDC Prison Being Built_

Central banks around the world have started building CBDCs. These need to be designed, and each design has consequences. When looking at the design choices made so far, we can see where things are headed. And it doesn’t look good…

As of now, no formal decisions have been made in the jurisdictions discussed. Regardless, the EU’s direction seems clear. Perhaps the US Congress still has a say in the future of money. We shall see.

What we see in the works is a system where small groups of unelected people get to approve all payments. There will be no privacy. It has purposefully designed features that control how much money you can hold and what kind of charges and (negative) interest rates apply. A system of constant surveillance, and the centralization of sensitive information.

And then we haven’t even talked about all the other policies increasingly being enforced through the financial system, such as a personal Co2 budget**70)** (or other social credit systems), the re-directing of private resources towards public policy goals (blended finance),**71)** and the exclusions of political undesirables.**72)**

CBDCs replace cash with a kind of money you never legally own, you can directly be charged interest and fees on, and cannot spend without permission.

# TLDR:

**CBDCs are liabilities directly with the central bank. They are a new kind of money. Next to cash and digital money currently held in private banks.**

**The Bank of International Settlements made an overview of all research into CBDCs. It shows that each design has consequences.**

**The ECB has chose for a design where intermediaries deal with the clients, but the ECB settles all payments. There is no real privacy in the system. To ensure financial stability, the ECB wishes to maintain control over account balances, apply variable (interest) charges, and monetary policy/stimulus. The digital Euro is in a far stage of development.**

**The Federal Reserve Act forces the FED to go through intermediaries as well. The digital USD will be programmable and identity-verified. To ensure financial stability, the FED wishes to maintain controls on interest charges and maximum account balances. The FED also argues that CBDCs might have to replace cash to maintain a healthy balance sheet. The digital USD appears to NOT be in a far stage of development.**",t2_23gdthxz,0.0,"…The Truth About CBDCs… Design Choices by ECB &amp; FED Analysed… Both Are Aiming At Tight Control Over Accounts, Interest and Spending...

Reserve Protocol is an Ethereum-based permissionless platform to launch and govern asset-backed stable currencies.

The protocol went live in October, and we have undertaken four independent audits during our launch months (Solidified, Trail of Bits, Halborn, Ackee).

Safety and lack of exploitation in our smart contracts is our number 1 priority, and our Code4 Audit is our last step towards All Clear 

I'm hoping on behalf of the team that any Ethereum experts in this sub will come along and help push this final step forward, in return for potential awards from the $210,500 USDC prize pool.

https://code4rena.com/contests/2023-01-reserve-contest

Once we announce our All Clear, anyone (including your good self), can create an asset-backed currency, using around ~50 RWAs / protocols as backing.

So far $300m a month moves through our protocol through the RPay app, predominantly in Latin America, predominantly non-crypto people using us in shops, for payroll, for remittance, and other everyday uses.

Our aim eventually is to give everyone the right to hold stable currency that retains its purchasing power over years, always on-chain 24/7, fully-backed, governed and diversified.

But first we want this fifth audit to validate every line of code, before we ask people to trust large amounts of capital in us.

If you are an auditor, hacker, or know your way around smart contracts, please come and find us!

# What is Arbitrum?

Arbitrum is a layer-2 solution and a project that aims to improve the performance and scalability of Ethereum smart contracts, as well as add privacy features. It allows developers to use Ethereum’s virtual machine and transactions at a second layer, while maintaining the security provided by the first layer.

# Will there be an Airdrop for the Community?

Speculation about the Arbitrum token airdrop is at a peak due to the high level of Total Value Locked (TVL) and active user statistics. This speculation was fueled by a tweet from the co-founder of OffchainLabs, the company behind Arbitrum.

# What to do to be eligbile?

Nothing is officially confirmed about an Arbitrum Airdrop.

ethereum,"Just looking at mevwatch.info, they have [a list of what proportion of blocks by different stakers are coming from censored relays](https://cryptodon.lol/@edmundedgar/109647013994643820). Generally if you're optimizing for profit this number should be pretty high, because some of the better *relays* are US companies that apply US sanctions. 

I'd assumed that the companies that would use censoring relays would be the very US-law-encumbered ones, like Coinbase and Kraken. But that's not what we see. Those companies are down in the ""profit-maximizing"" section. The companies that we see listed are:

 * ""Hacked"", basically defunct defi platforms: Stakehound and Cream Finance
 * A history of fraud and/or bankrupt: BitFinex and Celsius
 * Binance, which is known for not being overly troubled by US regulations. (I don't have an opinion on whether they're fraudulent or not, but personally it's not the kind of place I'd feel comfortable leaving my money overnight.)
 
The only one that fits the pattern I'd have expected is something called Ether Capital which seems to be a ""tradfi gateway to crypto"" type of outfit.

Basically when a financial institution wants to invest in another country, they have to carry out a currency swap so that they’re investing in the country’s fiat currency. It’s incredible hard for auditors to keep track of currency swaps. Huge blind spot, especially since currency swaps account for 80 some trillion dollars. For perspective, global GDP is roughly 100 trillion and US GDP is roughly 25 trillion. 

To be honest, I don’t know why it’s so hard to audit currency swaps, but I take the BIS’s word on authority with this shot over the bow. I’m not preaching a doomsday thesis, but more so express the possibility that something could go seriously wrong with this situation; given how much money we’re talking about, and humans being humans and their penchant for corruption, currency swaps could be a source of distress in the future should there be unsavory players meddling in the pot. We’re not talking FTX level money here with a few billion. Blind spots on the scale of a few billion is bad. Blind spots on the scale of tens of trillions might prove to be the biggest instance of gross negligence in human history. That opens the possibility for something to go seriously wrong.

ethereum,"I've been an investor in the stock market for many years now, things I've learned through experience is not to invest in a stock or ETF, but to invest in the product or the company itself. That's the thought process behind it.

Vitalik Buterin has an IQ of 257, which makes sense giving how he talks on podcasts. His sheer knowledge and dedication to the tech field, Eth, crypto, and blockchain is immense. When I buy my $50 of Ethereum every Friday, I'm investing in Vitalik. I trust his guidance, his roadmap, and the fact that he's turned down banks on a weekly basis is astonishing. I feel like he's part android, there's videos where he talks for minutes without blinking.

I live in Canada so I use Wealthsimple and being a stock market investor, I don't actually intend to use Ethereum for it's main purpose of storing on a cold wallet or utilizing its ability. I buy my shares of it and I will just hold it as an investment. We can stake Eth now so I will be doing that eventually which I'm excited for because it's basically ethereum paying me dividends.

Regardless, I think long term Ethereum will run computing defi on the planet. Visa is already talking with them!

ethereum,"Would love some feedback on something of a business idea I was considering.So if you look back through my post history, you'll see that I generally like to help people in crypto where possible with any problems that they have in crypto. It's a jungle out there and people are always there to take advantage of people. I enjoy helping people and I think there are plenty of beginners that would love to get into the space but don't know how or where to get started.

Now, I fully realise people are going to call this a scam and I'd find it very hard to ever get something like this off the ground however, I'd love to get some feedback from actual crypto users on the idea.

1. I won't be offering any sort of financial advice.
2. I would advise people on particular coins or airdrops if that particular person asked for any feedback on whether they look legitimate or not (based off num of holders, any online feedback or scam reports etc.). Regardless of any token looking legitimate, I would be carefully wording any response that any action is taken of their own decision.
3. Would help educate people, they can ask me any questions on crypto etc. I'd be happy to create videos or articles on concepts that might confuse you or that you're interested in learning more about.
4. Help with recovery or support issues. For e.g. in [r/Metamask](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/) you constantly see people withdraw a wrapped token on another chain and can't find the deposit to their wallet, I would help guide them to viewing the funds in their wallet, and ultimately, getting them back on the chain they actually intended to withdraw on. Or better yet, this person would be reaching out to me initially and I could offer them some pros and cons on the options available and they ultimately choose accordingly.

Now, obviously I'm in pretty early stages here of thinking about this if I'm coming to Reddit to ask for feedback however, does anyone have any feedback on this idea, or can you tell me what you would expect or like to see from this service? And how much would you pay monthly?

I'd obviously offer some assurances over getting back to you in a particular timeframe but would anyone ever pay for something that isn't offering you x100 gains and scamming you out of your hard earned money.

ethereum,"To sir and madam.  I am asking for your help.  I have used metamask to purchase reddit avatars on opensea.  since I am a new user on this, I have no experience and I have wrongly added money to WETH Etherium.  should have added to WETH Polygon .

I have no experience buying.  I mistakenly bought Weth Etherium and not Polygon. because at the time of purchase I was in the hospital ward because I received stroke treatment on the left hand.  Because I am interested in avatars, I don't want to miss  buy avatars because there are people selling avatars for 0.05 ETH.  due to my carelessness I did not see properly, I mistakenly took Weth Etherium.

The avatar costs 0.05 ETH (Polygon).  I have added 0.05 WETH Etherium on metamask.  Therefore the purchase cannot be done.  I have tried to convert on metamask but need to make a conversion from Weth Etherium -&gt; to ETH Etherium on the same network first.  After I got ETH Etherium currency and I can bridge to ETH Polygon.  that's what i'm trying to do.  because no other way is allowed in metamask.  I have already tried to convert a small amount but was unsuccessful because I need to have a small amount of Gas fees in ETH Etherium currency first so that the transaction is successful.  This cost requires around 1 Dollar.  

what I see Now I can only transfer the Weth Etherium to ETH Etherium and it requires Gas fees 1 Dollar.  I don't have Eth for the fee because all my money is in WETH and I can't transfer.  and after this transfer is completed,  I can bridge this to ETH polygon.  I am asking anyone who is willing to help me .

I want to manage my own keys and keep the dependencies used as simple as possible.

I'd really to be able to do 4 operations:

1. `make_transaction`: This would take three inputs - the `from_address_in_hex`, the `to_address_in_hex`, and the `amount` \- and output an `unsigned_transaction_in_hex`.
2. `submit_transaction`: This would take an input of a `signed_transaction_in_hex` and output details on which block it was included in.
3. `print_transaction`: This would take either an `unsigned_transaction_in_hex` or a `signed_transaction_in_hex` as input and output a human-readable ASCII version of all transaction fields.
4. `sign_transaction`: This wold take a `unsigned_transaction_hex` and a `private_key_hex` as inputs and output a `hex_signed_transaction`.

Operations 3 and 4 need to be able to run disconnected from the internet. Operation 1 and 2 need the internet, the former so it can look up the correct nounce and choose parameters related to gas prices for the transaction.

ethereum," So I was attempting a transaction, as you can see in my transaction, I wanted to spend the amount highlighted in the picture around 0.02 ETH.

I understand that with new coins there are limits to how much someone can buy so perhaps that's why my transaction failed.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

ethereum,"Hello guys, I’m new to the sub but has been writing Web3 off-chain back-end code for a over a year now.

I’m looking for Ethereum contract + topics combination that is guaranteed to emit at least 1 event log (or very few, but preferably just 1) every block for testing my library code.

So do you guys know of any such contracts? Thank you!

If you want to know why I need event log, it’s because because the Go library I’m writing centers around it being event log polling building blocks with real-time chain reorganization detection and handling baked in. To detect chain reorg while only getting information from event logs, I use log’s block hash and will only fetch block headers (for block hashes) if there’s a reorg and a log disappeared from the block. So that’s why I need event log for block hash and not the block header.

It is now done and will soon be open sourced, so I’m writing examples for devs. One of the examples is a single-file chain reorg monitor service. So I need a contract and topics that would make the example seems reasonable and cheapest to run, hence the question.

ethereum,"Hi! I have this particular use case and would like to share it, so people can recommend any solution besides building the solution myself, so here it is:

I want to keep some USDC or BUSD under a multi-sign wallet which requires 2 signatures to spend the funds (2 of 2 signatures), but, I can see a couple of issues with only having 2 parties and needing 2 signatures to perform anything with any funds in that multi-sign, first: death, second: separation of the parties involved and a need to return funds to each party.

Death: if one of the two parties dies during the duration of this trust of funds(?), the remaining party needs to go through and recover the other party's wallet to do anything with the funds, which is an annoyance at best.

Separation: let's say any of the involved parties want to stop putting money into this trust fund (again: is that the name of this thing?) and leave with their corresponding share of the money, but the other party doesn't want to sign anything, which freezes the funds until the dispute is settled and worst-case scenario none of the parties does what the other part asks, and a judge gets involved to resolve the conflict.

Then, some solutions come to mind solving both particular edge-cases at the same time: involving a third party that plays the role of arbitrator, it could be a lawyer who represents both parties... but these cost money, and you need to trust the lawyer to do The Right Thing™.

To me, what comes to mind is a smart contract, is cheaper than a lawyer, and you can write one (if you know what you are doing) to do The Right Thing™, but a smart contract can control 100% of the funds and do whatever N-of-M signatures requests, right? I wonder if a smart contract can be a signer party in a multi-sign wallet, my reasoning for that is that the ""N-of-M+smart contract"" signers control 100% of the funds, if someone smarter than the person writing the contract want to exploit a bug, the attacker won't get anything of value because he still needs other signers to participate in the ""hack"" (2 of the 3 signers in this case).

ethereum,"An EIP can be submitted by anyone, and becomes the responsibility of the author once they’re created. The author informs other developers of their proposal, gathers support to build and launch it, and documents work throughout the process.

The majority of EIPs are Standards Track EIPs, proposals that change the Ethereum protocol itself. Broadly, anything that technically changes Ethereum is a Standards Track EIP. There are several sub-types under the Standards Track: 

\- Core

\- Network 

\- Interface 

\- ERC

&amp;#x200B;

Core EIPs

[Core EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/core) are changes drastic enough to require a fork in the blockchain. Forks are when the blockchain splits in two because of a major decision, with one path following the old rules and the new path following the new ones.

Networking EIPs

[Networking EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/networking) are improvements to nodes communication and transactions are transmitted on Ethereum. Transactions are encrypted when sent; when I send you funds, I'm encrypting a message that only you can decrypt. Changes to these aspects are Networking EIPs.

Interface EIPs

[Interface EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/interface) are improvements for how applications interact with Ethereum. They standardize the API used for communication with the blockchain. An example is [EIP-6](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6), which changed an opcode on Ethereum from “Suicide” to “Self-Destruct” for mental health reasons.

ERC EIPs

Finally, [ERC EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc) establish new standards on Ethereum, often for smart contracts. These standards are responsible for tokens on Ethereum ([ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)) and non-fungible tokens ([ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)) and many more. Without these standards, tokens wouldn’t be easily tradeable.

Additional EIP Types

Standard Track EIPs (the ones listed above) are the most common. The less frequent [Meta EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/meta) covers non-technical changes in process; how development overall is managed. Finally, instead of proposing new features, [Informational EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/informational) elaborate on existing design details.

&amp;#x200B;

THE EIP Approval Process

[EIP-1](https://preview.redd.it/ey5cgm7lk29a1.jpg?width=1705&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f6e5ed26737c6d890f69c14653f7aa489da4ae5)

EIPs can be proposed by anyone, but often require the work of multiple people depending on their impact. [EIP Editors](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5069) review EIPs that are submitted, and multiple developers are usually required to build a feature. 

The effort to reward ratio factors greatly into which proposals are prioritized and which aren’t. They all follow an identical process that determines which EIPs get delivered first.

Before submitting an EIP, authors should first [vet the idea with others](https://ethereum-magicians.org) in the Ethereum development community. Assuming the idea is not covered by an existing EIP, the author creates a draft and submits it to the EIP Editors. 

There are different EIP Editors responsible for each sub-type of EIP; they’re responsible for making sure the proposals are technically sound. Once that’s done, they create the Draft version of the EIP.

Once an EIP Editor feels like the draft is ready to receive feedback from the community, they move it from being in Draft to in Review. At this stage, any member of the Ethereum development community can share their thoughts on how the proposal can be improved.

Once complete, the EIP enters the Last Call stage. This provides a final opportunity for feedback to be shared, usually within 14 days. If any major changes come up, the proposal moves back to Review. If no major feedback arises, then the EIP moves into the Final stage.

Once an EIP is Final, it becomes a candidate to include in Ethereum’s periodic upgrades (called forks). The process highlights the importance of individual responsibility in a decentralized environment. 

No features would be delivered if not championed by at least one person to start, and each is only made complete through the process of peer-review. 

May the brightest ideas win.

ethereum,"Arbitrum has recently brought up a discussion on Medium about [Delay Attacks on Rollups](https://offchain.medium.com/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a). In short, their post raises an important issue that affects all optimistic rollups that are based on interactive verifications, such as Optimism, Arbitrum, Cartesi, Truebit, etc.

In short, although the attack does not compromise the security of the rollups chain, it allows a well-funded party to delay its finality by continuously burning collaterals for the duration of the attack.

This news could have been worrisome, since it affects several different protocols. However, Delay Attacks are far from an unsurmountable problem.

First of all, Arbitrum itself has announced in their article that they know a solution to the problem. They have announced a new protocol to be published soon, which is already being implemented.

On another front, Cartesi’s contributors have also worked to tackle this Delay Attack and they have just published a solution to the issue in this [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12439).

In summary, under Cartesi’s proposal, a team of dishonest parties with x funds can be defeated in a single dispute by an honest player who is willing to deposit log(x) funds. This makes Delay Attacks impossible and sibling attacks impractical.

&gt;This article digs into the delay attack problem, and discusses how it was handled in various versions of the Arbitrum rollup protocol.(…)This is based on a technical breakthrough from the Arbitrum research team that makes all-against-all challenges feasible and efficient. This allows a single honest staker to efficiently defeat an army of attackers who have posted a forest of malicious branching assertions.

&gt;In this paper, we propose a practical dispute resolution algorithm by which a single honest competitor can win disputes while spending effort linear on the cost of the computation, but only logarithmic on the number of dishonest competitors. This algorithm is a novel, stronger primitive for building permissionless fraud-proof protocols, which doesn’t rely on complex economic incentives to be enforced.

ethereum,"Hi all,

A little over a week ago, I tried to purchase some ETH via the “Top Up” interface on the Torus wallet website, using the MoonPay option. As you can see, in *both* the drop down menu &amp; well as the left sidebar, the 3 crypto currency options to choose from with MoonPay, as presented on the Torus website, are ETH, MATIC, and USDC.

https://preview.redd.it/7t60gvybtv8a1.png?width=2170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a9e5f343252b6fc6e06d8a7adadcbfb256c039d

As this is my first time making such a purchase, I was extra thorough in checking every confirmation page &amp; email I was presented with, to make sure that the currency selected is “ETH”, as I had wanted to make sure I didn’t accidentally purchase MATIC.

…Which made it all the more shocking to me when MoonPay seems have sent me WETH???? WETH wasn’t even an option to choose from via the methods/interface I used, so I fail to see how this could have even been user (my) error?

Here is the polyscan link to the transaction

I submitted a support request on MoonPay’s website, and received no reply after 8 days.

(I did receive an automated email immediately after submitting the support request, saying they typically respond within 24 hours, excluding holidays, etc.)

If you want to read it, here is the message I submitted to MoonPay support (along with many of the screenshots in this post). No new information I haven’t already mentioned above, though, so you can probably skip over reading it.

So after 8 days, I sent a DM to u/MoonPaySupport on twitter, and got this reply.

https://preview.redd.it/jaerd881uv8a1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=036fb5ecc88a647a0824d5e152ae9932d7be89de

Note, that was &amp; to this day still is, my first &amp; only crypto currency related transaction I’ve ever done with that wallet, or any other wallet. That is, in fact, the first crypto wallet I ever had. So it’s quite literally impossible that I had done anything else in the past with my account/wallet/history that was against their terms &amp; conditions. I have literally never had *any* crypto currency in my possession/ownership until that WETH they seem to have mistakenly sent me instead of the ETH I had purchased from them.

With all that said \[thank you, sincerely if you read through this far\], my questions are:

1. Am I correct in understanding that I should have received ETH and not WETH? There actually is an issue here, right?
2. Given that u/MoonPaySupport said “This decision is final and we won't be able to provide any further assistance on this matter.” It seems I have zero course of action to take in regards to getting the ETH I paid for from them?
3. Any recommendations for where I can reliably/safely purchase some ETH, ideally not from an exchange where I need to submit a bunch of documents to open an account? I am Canadian / credit card has Canadian address, if that makes a difference. My resistance towards submitting documents to open an account with an exchange isn’t because I am trying to remain anonymous or anything, but because ALL I WANT right now is enough ETH to pay for some gas fees to transfer some NFTs out of my Torus wallet, and opening an account with an exchange seems so “excessive”/so much work (yet here I am typing out this long ass post).

ethereum,"I have this question in my mind, as i hear fear of ETH being more Centralized as one of the reason being few Validators control majority of Staked ETH (coinbase, Binance etc).

As Ethereum network being merged to POS many long term Hodlers are adding ETH to stake them (15M+ staked). 

I do notice that there is a strong need for being Self Validator rather in Dec/Cen Pools like LIDO,Coinbace etc. And its not easy rather simple to become validator and Stake with 32 ETH.

There fore i have a suggestion OR proposal to bring it to Ethereum Devs.

1- Try to bring a Mobile (Mini Hard drive) Device (Preconfigured) and could be become single or Multiple Validator node's with Extension to Mobile APP to control.

2- This device with the size of an Iphone connects with WIFI/LAN, bluetooth/ USB Charging etc.

3- Reduce collateral limit from 32 ETH to 8 ETH OR Less. this way more Young investors will start there own Validator nodes.

I am not sure if there is any device available, But this would bring Ethereum network security to be more Decentralized.

ethereum,"While headlines focus on declining token prices, blockchain technology is doing fine and attracts record levels of users, investment, and interest from mainstream organizations.  


Global payment provider VISA recently showed its intentions with web3 infrastructure and blockchain, with a heavy focus on security, scalability, interoperability, and privacy. At the same time, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, one of the world's leading investment, advisory, and risk management firms, declared that open, decentralized ledgers would be an integral part of the global economy's future.  


From the beginning, I believed that blockchain tech will make great changes for many industries.   


I'm super excited to see how will all of this development in the near future, there are already some great predictions for the next year considering the Flare blockchain, for example, that aims to create a true cross-chain reality by “Connecting Everything.” using decentralized systems or there's tech startup Banger Games wants to open up new opportunities for gamers by becoming the first hub to reward players for their in-game and community activity, regardless of the game, publisher, or platform they do this on. Simply put, gamers will be able to receive rewards for playing leading online games such as PUBG &amp; Counter-Strike.  


This year my greatest revelation was Elan Future, a blockchain-based system that can send power to anyone, anywhere in seconds, allowing for a direct and seamless energy transfer without middlemen, fees, or restrictions. This project allows anyone to participate in energy production, implying that energy democratization has finally arrived.  


I am aware that the metaverse is becoming a buzzword for Web3, while genuinely decentralized finance bubbles to the top after the collapse of several centralized exchanges. And when it comes to NFTs, they command attention and show a path toward tokenizing everyday assets, while digital collectibles infusion with blockchain games takes the industry to an entirely new level.

ethereum,"Look I don't usually like to dunk on projects, but Status came out of the 2017 bull market with almost $100M in capital, and frankly I'm shocked this team has failed to produce anything, let alone a usable standard for Ethereum based messaging that's safe. Everything on paper has pretty much said Status should be a dominant messenger. We had in the past year with covid:

- Multiple political turmoil that should have allowed Status to become mainstream as an effective privacy tool
- A great bull run catalyst that could have captured more users
- An entire NFT ecosystem that uses chat and token gating tools

Yet, in every case, Status completely fumbled with effective marketing and strategy. To this day, there's no incentive to run nodes, no reason to use it as a wallet since its mostly clunky and doesn't natively support L2s, and even your top tier Ethereum users just don't use it.

What is wrong with this team? I feel like it's in a position to really get major use and be a great mainstream wallet, yet teams like Rainbow and even Argent have captured more users. I frankly think it's embarrassing that in our ecosystem, we have to defer to horrifying alternatives for private chat like Discord and Telegram instead of using an Eth native alternative, yet here we are outsourcing to insecure options because Status cannot even get a product out the door even after being given $100M. Whatever happened to adding this chat layer onto nodes to help boost adoption? Whatever happened to the update that was supposed to happen months ago? Whatever happened to the desktop client? Whatever happened to the team ""dogfooding"" the app and being responsive on Status chat rooms, who are now basically running all comms in Discord at this point? This team barely managed to even be present at their table at devcon

I'm sorry but I think there needs to be some serious public shaming right now to get this team to either reorganize and fire it's leads, or at least do some amount of work to get a product out the door. If Ethereum wants to be more mainstream, we should at least promote a secure web3 chat product that could be useful in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan.

ethereum,"So I learnt that ERC20 tokens have `Transfer` and `TransferFrom` event. From my understanding `Transfer` event is when a transaction comes from an address to the smart contract instructing the transfer of some of its tokens to another address. `TransferFrom`, comes from an address that has been pre approved to transfer tokens from another address.

Here are my questions:

- What event is triggered when normal transfer of Eth from one account to another account occurs?
- What example are there on how to subscribe to these events using the JSON_RPC endpoints? Is subscribing to ERC20 token events different from subscribing to normal Ethereum transfer?

From my research I found that Ethereum has plans for transitioning to post-quantum cryptography (I believe with the Splurge?). I would love to schedule an online session (30 min. to 1 hour) sometime in the middle of January with a lead-developer or cryptography expert at Ethereum to discuss their views on post-quantum cryptography and the barriers of implementation, along with certain drivers for change and potential limitations. 

I would really appreciate it if we could set this meeting up, so if you are someone that is willing to conduct this interview or know anyone in Ethereum that would be open to this, please help me out!!

ethereum,"Platforms for creating 3D games have been for a long time, but only recently have they started to be integrated with Ethereum.

Developers have been able to design games that enable users to own their digital assets and fully control their distribution and exchange through the use of Ethereum.

ethereum,"From the beginning Ethereum became my fav crypto, it seemed more complex and interesting than Bitcoin since it is the home of smart contracts and decentralized applications, holding a major share of the total value locked in the sector. Ethereum’s dominance in the dApp market was up to 90% before other rival platforms were created.  


Ethereum is still the undisputed king of dApps. Despite its high fees, the platform is still the first choice for different applications, ranging from finance, exchanges, and storage to gaming, NFTs, and governance.   


This shows how far it has come since its whitepaper was published in 2013, it seems like it was yesterday, times definitely flies.  


Like everything else, Ethereum started as an idea. And unlike Bitcoin, which was only intended for financial usage, the aim was to employ blockchain technology to create decentralized applications. This was the idea of Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin, who is of Russian descent.  


Today, we may even receive free renewable energy thanks to blockchain tech, if you look at projects like Elan Future; all of these things appeared so far away just a few years ago. I think that it's incredible how much tech evolved.  


Like everything else ETH had its ups and downs through all these years, but I'm super excited to see how will it evolve in upcoming years, especially because the upgrade is expected to be fully implemented around 2024 or beyond. This means that until then, Ethereum will likely continue to depend on off-chain scaling solutions such as layer 2 and sidechains.

ethereum,"Have you heard about Visa's most recent revelation that it is working to implement auto-payments on Ethereum through the development of a novel wallet type—a procedure dubbed ""account abstraction"" by the company?  


According to what I've heard, Visa did in fact issue a technical paper in which it looked into the idea of creating an automatic payment mechanism for Ethereum self-custodial wallets.  


I find it amazing what we can all do with the help of modern technologies, cryptocurrencies, and other things.  


In addition to the payment systems, the ticketing industry, and other things, blockchain may also prevent the production of free clean energy. I also think that the energy sector will use blockchain in the near future. The amount of electricity needed to meet the world's energy needs, as well as the effects of the global community on the climate and the cost of energy, might be greatly reduced thanks to this cutting-edge technology, claims Elan Future.  


Enabling auto-payments for self-custodial wallets is difficult in light of the recent Visa and ETH news, as doing so may require granting access to one's private keys to a smart contract that will be making the payments on their behalf. In essence, auto-payments have the potential to jeopardize the security offered by self-custody.  


The process of confirming a transaction on the blockchain would apparently become more flexible as a result of all of this, in my opinion.

Bitcoin,"https://seedle.io

Today we're officially launching a website called Seedle.io that enables people to enhance the security of their wallets by scrambling the order of their seed phrases based on a secret key.  

The way it works is that a secret key generates a unique combination of scrambled numbers that map to the actual order of a seed. For example the key ""Hello World"" generates this combination:  

1  13    &gt;&gt;    9  11  
2  14    &gt;&gt;    4  14  
3  15    &gt;&gt;    13 20  
4  16    &gt;&gt;    23 24  
5  17    &gt;&gt;    8  12  
6  18    &gt;&gt;    2  5  
7  19    &gt;&gt;    6  16  
8  20    &gt;&gt;    22 21  
9  21    &gt;&gt;    3  15  
10 22    &gt;&gt;    **1**  18  
11 23    &gt;&gt;    10 19  
12 24    &gt;&gt;    7  17  

The sequence on the left side represents the false order and the combination on the right side represents the true order. What we get is that instead of #1 actually being the first phrase in the seed, the combination reveals that the first phrase is at #9, #2 is at #4, and so on... Note that the bolded **1** in the 10th position is meant to be replaced with an incorrect phrase from the list of 2024 words.

This scrambled order creates a layer of cryptographic security that obscures the true identity of a seed. The difficulty of guessing the correct order is 2048^24 or 2.96 x 10^79. To put that into perspective, a computer guessing 2^23 or 8,388,608 combinations per second would take 3.65 * 10^95 years to exhaust all possible combinations.  

The best part of this security enhancement is that you do not need to enter your seed phrase anywhere. All that's required is a password that only you know. The rest of the process is using the combination as your ""seed"" and hiding it as usual (or not). Here's mine:  

| Column 1 | Column 2 |

Bitcoin,"In light of all this talk regarding what the best method of self custody for bitcoin and crytptocurrencies is, I want to further dive into making this a reality for people.

We all understand that exchanges are the bottom of the barrel. Probably suffice for the average user with minimal capital invested and less tech savvy, but most people that are on these forums are likely beyond that.

For the rest of the people here, I imagine there's a mix of Web wallets, applications, retail Cold wallets and paper wallets.

As my account grows, I feel more and more uncomfortable keeping my funds on a Web Wallet. I feel little trust in buying a Cold Wallet build by a company due to recent news of data leaks, and so one thing I want to explore more of, is the construction of your own, off-line hardware wallet.

Bitcoin,"Ultimately when you look into the fundamentals of bitcoin you discover that it’s legit. We in the bitcoin community know this. It’s separate from all other cryptocurrencies and is superior. 

The market is currently on the fence. Some investors understand and have bought which is why we are at the levels we’re at now but what catapults us to the next level is more investors realizing that the answer really was bitcoin. 

Originally I thought small business was going to be the next great push. But I’ve changed my mind. There’s a chicken and egg problem with using bitcoin and after all these years we’re still not there. We’re still too early and because of that we’re still in the early adopter phase (which means investors.) 

The idea that needs to propagate is this: the potential outweighs the risk. That’s it. 

The reason Tesla exploded the way it did was because when you look at how many machines run on oil and there’s this company which wants to turn them electric. There’s an enormous potential for growth. And rightly so. The only downside is that the technology is not exclusive and now we’re seeing the competition catching up, etc. 

Well, with bitcoin there is no competition. Many have tried, all have failed. And the potential for bitcoin is greater than an electric car…

Bitcoin,"If you can't Google it, then it's the dark web. So all Web 3 sties at this time, TOR sites, and content from individual accounts, such as email, social media, banking, along with personal and professional databases, and documents (legal and medical).

So when media does fearmongering and say x% of transactions are on the dark web. 

1. How did they come up with that number. Like I seen recently they pulled 70% out of their ass. That number is too low.
2. It is highly likely 90%+ of transactions are on the dark web due to it being on exchanges and using an interface and system you only get AFTER you log in and that isn't searchable on Google. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then again, there could be a debate if 100% is the right number. Like all the transactions are happening over the blockchain over the internet. On one hand the transaction isn't indexed on Google or whatever. Like if it is, then it would be a while after. But then again, you can use tools that is available to the public without logging in to view the blockchain. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR

If someone freaks out about the ""dark web"" or ""dark net"" or they listen to this fearmongering. Make sure they know their email is on the dark web. You have to log in to see it, and it isn't public indexed.

Bitcoin,"I wrote this article ([Guess My Seed Phrase: 12 Words vs. 24 Words](https://www.whatisbitcoin.com/security/guess-my-seed-phrase#Guess_My_Seed_Phrase)) back in November to show the power of a 24 word seed phrase compared to a 12 word seed phrase. 

To show the difference rather than just talking about it, I publicly posted scrambled seed words for 2 valid seed phrases in the article. 1 was 12 words and the other was 24 words. I sent 100k sats to the 12 word seed phrase and 1 million sats to the 24 word seed phrase. 

The 12 words seed phrase was brute forced in less than a month (just as I anticipated) but the 24 word seed phrase has yet to be guessed.

* BTC Lightning Network continues disrupting the payments industry by showing consistent growth and increasing user confidence each year.   

* In 2022 alone, payments made through the Lightning Network grew by 97% and accounted for 6.29% of all orders paid in Bitcoin, compared to 4.53% in 2021. That means, on average, last year, every 16th order at CoinGate was paid using the Lightning Network layer.   

* In general, 2022 was great for the Lightning Network as the capacity in BTC has doubled over the year while the node count has also increased, signaling a speeding-up adoption of its use. 

Knowing how much effort in development is put into this technology, it’s unlikely to see the adoption rate slowing down anytime soon.

Bitcoin,"Hey all,

I recently set up my own LND (Lightning Network Daemon) node and have been learning about the best practices for managing and optimizing it. One thing I've been struggling with is rebalancing my channels to ensure that they are evenly balanced and not costing me more in fees than they are worth.

After some research, I discovered a really easy way to rebalance my LND node using a tool called LNRebalance. It's an open-source command-line tool that can automatically rebalance my node based on configurable criteria, such as the minimum and maximum channel balance and the maximum fee percentage.

To use LNRebalance, all I had to do was install it using the go get  
 command and then run it from the terminal with the desired options. It handled the rest of the rebalancing process automatically, saving me a lot of time and effort.

If you're running your own LND node and are looking for an easy way to rebalance your channels, I highly recommend giving LNRebalance a try. It's been a game-changer for me, and I hope it can help you too!

What tools or techniques do you guys use to rebalance your LND nodes? Let me know in the comments!",,,Effortlessly rebalance your LND node with LNRebalance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1672838402,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'And there will be a constant danger that some of the early promoters may feel and attempt to realise a sort of proprietorship in the organisation, to make a group or a gang of it. But to recognise that danger is half-way to averting it.' (chapter 1)

A Satoshism!

He concludes with this as one part of the summaries;

' Reconstruction through socialisation, strenuous educational work to build up a competent receiver for bankrupt and expropriated public utilities, a steady development of a loyal civil service, freed from—""Farleyism"" seems to be the word I want—and after the harsh winter that must surely follow this present Fall, a new spring may break upon the world from America.

The project: Ever since I discovered Bitcoin (December 2020) I've been fascinated by the ideas it promotes and the benefits it could bring to all of us (not only monetary but also social and political benefits).

Because there's imo no better way to promote a new idea than education and also because I love books, I thought about buying some copies of [The Little Bitcoin Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51815985-the-little-bitcoin-book) and just distribute them among the many book cabinets that contain books you can take for free (people in Munich will know what I'm talking about).

Bitcoin,"Luke Dashjr, one of the original core creators of Bitcoin, claimed that a hack cost him 200 or more Bitcoins. The developer claimed in a tweet that the suspected hackers had acquired access to his PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) key.

Upon asking, ""how PGP key lead to losing Bitcoin? I mean if he using Hot Wallet then it probably should be very secure"", he replied, "" Everything is compromised. ""

That is a nice explanation. 

Another Twitter user said, "" I don't buy this. You of all people should have at least some basic Opsec, and you are leading us to believe you kept over 200 BTC on a hot wallet? ""

Luke's response was lukewarm: ""No, they got my cold wallet too somehow ""

Those that are in the space for a while understand that unless their keys are compromised or stolen, it is impossible to hack a cold wallet. Never happened till data, the history of cold wallets speaks for itself. But, it is coming from a Bitcoin core developer, which is concerning because if he can't keep his Bitcoin secure, who really can?

When asked, "" Doesn't sound like a cold wallet if your keys were on a computer connected to the internet, or am I misunderstanding the situation? ""

His response: "" They weren't supposed to be.  I agree they must have been somehow.""

Now, Luke is one of the OGs of space, and if he could lose Bitcoins, an average Joe certainly can. However, with a cold wallet, it is not possible; it is what is being told to all of us at the least. 

Then comes in CZ with his tweet:  Sad to see even an OG Bitcoin Core Developer lost 200+ BTC ($3.5 million). Self custody have a different set of risks.""

Wow! What a brilliant way to market your services! Hitting the iron when it's hot. Kudos

I'm not saying that Luke was paid by CZ to lie about the stolen BTC. He probably already had enough to decline such an opportunity.

I have 3 wallet.dat files from 2018 and 2020 and I'm at least 50% sure there's between 1-3 BTC located on one of them. Given that even 0.25 BTC would be life changing for me right now, it would be incredible if I could access these wallets.

I've tried every password I can think of to no avail. This morning I've been looking into BTCRecover and finally got it running, but it's going to take a ridiculous amount of time to brute-force even a 6 character password with the hardware I have, because there's a good chance I used a combination including numbers and special characters in the original password.

Bearing the above in mind, is there someway I can extract the public wallet addresses from these wallet.dat files to know if this is something worth perusing or not? If I could at least find out what the situation was, I could then make an informed decision on the best way to proceed.

I'm 90% sure these are wallet.dat files created by Electrum Bitcoin Wallet. All are password protected (encrypted).

**Discussion:**

It's interesting to see, the lower the timeframe that the chart looks back, the lower the forecast high of the next cycle is. I believe the reason is due to the diminishing ""blow-off tops"" we are seeing from cycle to cycle. I have a theory for that - bitcoin network access to new funds:

*  The first cycle, Bitcoin gained access to a new pool of funds, ""first movers"". 
* The second cycle, Bitcoin also gained access to a new pool of funds through a rise in exchanges providing easy access. 
* The third cycle, Bitcoin gained access to new funds through a large increase in media coverage. 
* The fourth cycle (current cycle), Bitcoin didn't gain access funds that would make as significant a step change to the price as it had in previous cycles. 

As such, the lack of blow-off top in the current cycle effects the best fit price forecast more significantly when the time period examined is lower. 

So, where should the top estimate fall, with such a wide range showing in the charts between **200K** and **450K**? 

* With no significant increase in access to new funds, I'm looking at 200K as a top.
* If several **larger** nations start to adpot BTC as legal tender, I'm looking at 350K as a top. 
* If several larger nations and institutions gain access through clear and favorable regulation, then I'm looking at 450K as a top. 

I believe on a log scale, these events have a similar impact to the previously discussed events in past cycles such as first movers, rise in exchanges and increase in media converage. We are currently at 16/17K, suggesting from the current value we see a **1200-2800 %** increase to the top of the next cycle. 

The better question, I think, is what should an exit strategy look like? Well, we currently have 482 days until the next halving and 1007 days until the estimated top based on previous cycles (2016 cycle was 525 days from halving to top, 2020 cycle was 546 days from halving to top). With 2.75 years to top, an exit strategy is a tough question to consider, especially considering the swings in monetary policy over the last 2 years. 

For now, I'm looking purely at the time to top and its correlation with the halving. The halving event inherrently forms a supply demand crunch, causing upward pressure on the price. Significant upward prices always lead to FOMO and hence an overshoot on true valve, as we have seen in every cycle. The time duration of this overshoot has always been roughly the same in the BTC space (again, 524 &amp; 546 days in the past 2 cycles), if there is one thing I am willing to rely on, it is that human nature repeats itself. This date, for those curious, is 7th of October 2025. 

What would have me re-evaluate the estimated top date is if one of the aformentioned events (large nations adopting BTC and institutional access) occurs 12+ months after the halving, in which case I think we could see the top date pushed further out due to a late boom in access to new funds. In this case, I would start to look at the 300/450K to form the basis of my exit strategy, rather than a set date. 

Let us know your thoughts!

*As a final though provoker, we often see an estimate cap put on BTC due to its similarity to gold as a store of value, ""digital gold"". The valuation of the gold market is roughly 10T. However, is estimated to be 1:200ish physical to paper ratio, why do we not see this considered when corrilating it in a store of value sense to BTC?*

Could bitcoin be an effective buffer in the electricity market in a state of hyperbitcoinisation?

1) Current bitcoin reward per day:

6.25 x (6 x 24) x $16000 = $14,400,000/day

(6.25 blocks every 10minutes for one day multiplied by  the bitcoin price)

2) Possible bitcoin reward in the future:

Assuming same proportional bitcoin reward and a bitcoin price of $10,000,000 (in a world of hyperbitcoinisation):

10,000,000/16000 x 14,400,000 = $9,000,000,000/day (9 billion dollars per day)

3) Total electricity expenditure per day currently:

82 exajoules per year

([https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/52f66a88-0b63-4ad2-94a5-29d36e864b82/KeyWorldEnergyStatistics2021.pdf](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/52f66a88-0b63-4ad2-94a5-29d36e864b82/KeyWorldEnergyStatistics2021.pdf))

44 billion per exajoule

(https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=cost+of+one+exajoule+of+electricity)

82 x 44,000,000,000 / 365 = $9,884,931,506 (9.8 Billion dollars per day)

4) Total new gold production per day:

3000 tonnes of gold per year

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/238414/global-gold-production-since-2005/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/238414/global-gold-production-since-2005/)

3000 tonnes of gold x $53 million per tonne / 365 = 435,000,000 (0.4 Billion dollars per day)

Conclusion:

Even if the block reward is substantially decreased compared to current values, if bitcoin becomes the predominant money, it may well provide extra value in stabilising grids.",,,Could bitcoin be an effective buffer in the electricity market in a state of hyperbitcoinisation? - calculations need checking - may contain errors.

I've finally managed to stack some sats. Unfortunately really low numbers still, I don't expect a solid number in my wallet for a long time.

I'm scared shitless after that switch flipped. I'm working exponentially harder to get more of a currency that's getting exponentially weaker.

I'm in India btw. So we're way worse than the dollar. Although India is new to capitalism (started in the 90s), I see 2/3 decades of upside here VS other established countries because the demand and volume inside the system is increasing daily.

Proof of keys day was originally created out of (well placed) distrust of exchanges. Given this crowd has no coins on exchanges and already self-custodys how can you celebrate this tradition?  


Today, I have an idea for how to celebrate proof of keys day as someone who already self-custodys everything. lntipbot. Its a small amount of sats, but if you don't know how to withdraw from the bot, today is a good day to practice.  


The wiki for the lntipbot is located here:  [index - lntipbot (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lntipbot/wiki/index/)   


It says you have to send commands via DMs to the bot, but not normal DMs it seems. Specifically, with this link: [https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=lntipbot](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=lntipbot)  


In the message body (not the subject) you have to use the command:  
 **!withdraw &lt;invoice&gt;**   


As an example: !withdraw  lnbc1u1pw56zdypp5xj2cudlluuya6pvrqqmyg7n7plp5ha8298e6jkkkevzglkkph8cqdqqcqzpgqk0c8y3654qnulpt3ugn80echqaqt87h9hfv2fsxlt82s8uf0agxd9lfh9anp5cl2mwvp45jtry8gwt4j0d5x03y4v9vkex3mu3dqqsq3269du   


But how do I get an invoice? Well, I'm going to tell you how with my favorite LN wallet (your wallet may be different)  
In Pheonix wallet:  
\&gt;Recieve  
\&gt;Right most button under the QR code. Looks like a notpad with a pen on it  
\&gt;Create invoice (Edit the invoice if you don't want to withdraw everything from the lntipbot  
\&gt;Left most button under QR code to copy  


!withdraw &lt;paste what was copied from Pheonix wallet&gt;  


Then you can deposit after proof of keys day!  


For me, this amount of sats is very small and I would not bat an eye if it was lost completely. I do this not out of paranoia, but out of celebration of the holiday on the 3rd of January

Bitcoin," If you're thinking about investing in cryptocurrency, you need to be aware of the risks. Here's why you should be careful with cryptocurrency.  


A lot of people are interested in cryptocurrency these days, but there are a few things to be aware of before investing. 

* First, it’s important to understand that cryptocurrency is still a relatively new technology and is therefore subject to a lot of volatility.
* Secondly, there have been a number of scams and hacks associated with cryptocurrency, so it’s important to be careful when dealing with it.

## Be careful with cryptocurrency

Investing in cryptocurrency is risky, and you should be careful before investing any money. Cryptocurrency values can fluctuate wildly, and investors can lose a lot of money if they don't know what they're doing. 

You should only invest money that you can afford to lose, and you should always consult with a financial advisor before investing. 

### Why you should be careful with cryptocurrency- you could lose everything

Cryptocurrencies are often traded on decentralized exchanges and can also be used to purchase goods and services. 

However, there are also many risks associated with investing in cryptocurrency. For example, the value of a cryptocurrency can fluctuate wildly, and you could lose all of your investment if you're not careful. 

Additionally, cryptocurrency exchanges are often hacked, and investors can lose all of their money if they don't have proper security measures in place.

If you're thinking about investing in cryptocurrency, it's important to do your research and understand the risks involved.",,,Why You Should Be Careful with Cryptocurrency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1672755059,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The telecom industry is facing a disproportionate demand and supply due to poor user experience and low accessibility of connectivity for consumers. Thus, those who develop and operate telecom networks don't have enough clients, which can lead to prolonged development of the market and skyrocketing service prices.

But with Weaver Labs, that's no longer the case. Their ecosystem aims to improve accessibility, enhance the user experience with a software-based platform, and unite those who build networks with those who consume them.

They've developed Cell-Stack, a software stack that aggregates all telecoms infrastructure and opens it up to be consumed as a service. It acts as an open marketplace of telecommunications assets, using blockchain technology to create a ""network of networks"" and bridge the gap in the telecoms area.

Cell-Stack offer s two types of followers } to interact with it: the supply side (those who own telecoms infrastructure) and the demand side (those who want to consume services). Blockchain technology is used to solve friction when accessing telecoms infrastructure, serving as a key governance component of the marketplace and coordinating trust among all the different players of the network.

With the rise of cloud networks and the open access model, which is more focused on users than on functionalities, now is the perfect moment to innovate the telecoms sector with cutting-edge Web 3.0. solutions.

When all Bitcoins have been mined, then it is only transaction fees that will be paid to miners. In that case, the transaction fees would have to increase? Otherwise why would anyone mine? Or would there be other ways for miners to get a return? Or would there be self-sustainable mining (e.g. using solar) set up running automatically across the world that doesn’t generate a return.

If transaction fees are too high, does that then limit the use of Bitcoin? The value of anything is determined by what people view it to be worth, and if the use of Bitcoin is limited, would value of Bitcoin then fall, and could that lead to the whole Bitcoin project collapsing?

Last Friday I received a refund and so I wanted to buy Bitcoin with the money - it was £10. At the moment of my purchase my account was frozen - and it still is. 

Since last Friday afternoon I have been unable to access my account and my funds within it. No reason has been given but they did ask who controlled the address I sent the BTC to (I hated having to explain myself as it’s my money). 

The only way I’ve been able to live is thanks to my Bitcoin and Bitrefill. 

No reason given! And still my account is blocked!! Why are these banks giving me such a hard time?",,,Locked Out of Bank Account - Thank God for BTC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1672738837,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bitcoin,"I'm concerned because it seems that bitcoin is not achieving the goals that were set for it as a technology. 

Adoption for making payments has stalled, merchants simply don't accept it as a means of payment, even though it would be very convenient for many use cases (such as paying for movie tickets or articles, or making anonymous payments in contact apps). Not even beggars are using QR codes to allow enthusiasts to tip them with Lightning Network. 

These issues, along with the limitations of both bitcoin and the Lightning Network, and the uncertainty about how mining will fare as block rewards decrease after each halving, make me skeptical that the price will ever reach ATH again in the future.

Description

What is Bitcoin? An apparently simple question that hides a great deal of complexity.

Coming to understand Bitcoin in all its magnitude is difficult. Bitcoin is a constantly evolving system that requires knowledge in multiple disciplines. Game theory, philosophy, cryptography, networks and distributed systems, and economic and monetary theory, among others.

And while other books on Bitcoin focus on some of the areas of knowledge, creating a narrow view of the concept of Bitcoin, The Fundamentals of Bitcoin aims to give a 360-degree view through a journey divided into four chapters

The first chapter delves into the philosophical underpinnings and motivations for the creation of Bitcoin. A long road that begins in the late 80s with significant advances in modern cryptography, followed by a series of attempts to create private digital money by a group of cryptographers and programmers known as the cypherpunks, and with the 2008 financial crisis as a catalyst.

The second chapter recounts the events surrounding the publication of the Bitcoin white paper and the network’s launch, the influences that inspired its creation, and its evolution during the first years of existence and until the disappearance of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Finally, the chapter describes the steps for getting started with Bitcoin. From acquisition to receipt, transfer, or tracking bitcoin.

The third chapter focuses on the economic and financial fundamentals behind Nakamoto’s invention. It starts by exploring the origin of money, its functions, and the properties necessary for an asset or good to fulfill its mission as money. The chapter also analyzes Bitcoin’s monetary policy and its economic cycles.

The fourth and final chapter of the book examines the technical foundations through the study of Bitcoin’s four main components: the peer-to-peer network and its nodes, the blockchain and its transactions, the decentralized system for blocks and transactions verification, and the mining or Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. The chapter also provides a brief introduction to the Lightning Network, a second-layer solution built on top of Bitcoin.

Students in my classes frequently ask me how long it takes me to prepare the sessions where I explain Bitcoin. They refer to the preparation of the material. My response usually surprises them: more than five years and fifteen thousand hours of reading, studying, and building. My classes and this book are intended to help others shorten the learning curve and avoid the misinformation that frequently surrounds this wonderful invention.

Let me guide you on an incredible journey of learning what Bitcoin is and how it works, the decentralized digital money of the future, and one of the most important inventions of the 21st century.",,,The Fundamentals of Bitcoin - A new 360° view bitcoin book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1672720415,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bitcoin,"I was having a chat with some friends over Christmas about this. Back in 2017, when I first looked into bitcoin, I thought it was pretty cool. The idea of sending some sort of 'value' from one person to another with no intermediary is powerful stuff but I am not sure where we are today. Please see my points below; 

\- I am not sure if BTC has evolved in the way we would have thought. People still do not use it for transferring value and if you believe the use case is more related to 'store of value', we dont even do that properly. Everyone just keeps their funds on an exchange. Its not their fault, people never really got comfortable with having a seedphrase where if you lose it or forget it, its over. There have been efforts to bright this gap (multi sig) but it never really took off. 

\- This entire sub is just about the price. EVERYONE just cares about price. No one is doing some proper DD on whether BTC actually saving money on transactions, or how secure the blockchain is now as apposed to a year. Its all about price, which might be a red flag. I dont know. 

Frankly I don't know where BTC goes from here but if all we care about is price going up, then I think BTC isn't succeeding.",,,It is time to admit that bitcoin (and crypto to a larger extent) hasn't evolved in way we thought it would?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1672658505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

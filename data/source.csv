bitcoin,when a stock is going up good investment advice is to wait for the stock to come in go down before you buy it to go up again if you watched bitcoin last week you saw that happening once maybe twice a day like now bitcoin was at hours ago it fell an hour later now bitcoin is over again this is not normal behavior investors are ignoring good advice why this sudden behavior business owners are careful money managers for the most part they particularly pay attention to future money conditions including what the federal reserve does in regards to interest rates this last week fed governors on the investment committee georgia brown and neal kashkari came and said that inflation was going to last at least a couple of years the only way that could happen is for the fed to slow down interest rate hikes inflation is under their control so businessmen listening to this now have to deal inflation in their business one of was to keep inflation down in your business is to buy commodities and store them in a warehouse but several years worth a better idea is to buy bitcoin and store them on your desk now that bitcoin winter is over they will even make some extra money so the owners are buying bitcoin at a discount and they will continue at least until bitcoin gets back to so what can you do at least for the next weeks buy as much as possible there will be up in the price watch the price this weekend that s how you will know what s going to happen on tuesday ,buy what dip ,1.0,1,10bo0yy,michellesis,0,2023-01-14 13:07:07,1673701638,1673701639,2023-01-14,13:07:07

bitcoin,so are we pumping because janet yellen has declared we will hit the debt cieling in a week and the republicans in congress seem dysfuctional enough to hit that or are we pumping because the cpi numbers show lower inflation keep in mind that these are two diametrically opposed reasons to pump if the us defaults the treasuries will be downgraded and as a result the interest rates on bonds and everything else will go through the roof doesnt matter what the fed thinks the interest should be its going to go to or more terrible situation if the cpi numbers are good the fed can say inflation is dropping and lower the interest rates which makes for a good situation for risk on assets so which is it is it a pump out of fear of default and us dollar going to zero or a pump out of greed and speculation that the fed will lower interest rates ,so thoughts on why we are pumping ,1.0,1,10bgrd3,gitk-ghost,0,2023-01-14 05:42:58,1673674988,1673674989,2023-01-14,05:42:58

bitcoin,i have heard this a lot about btc btc is a zero sum game which to me implies money can't be made by owning btc my intention in writing this is not to discuss peoples motives for why they own btc and whether they are right or wrong this zero sum nonsense keeps ringing in my ear is btc really a zero sum game well yes in my opinion if we are discussing transactions in terms of btc its actually a slight net loss every transaction requires some sort of network fee but on the other had in terms of dollars it really depends if you assume the interest in btc remains constant from this moment of time on then holding btc inherently increases in dollar value overtime if you assume no increase or decrease in btc then you're comparing a finite number with fiat which the fed for example prints more and more of overtime by this train of thought your x amount of btc last year will be worth some amount more in fiat this year so in terms of dollars its likely a net gain i don't claim to be a financial wizard in fact i'm fine if this is completely idiotic but the argument of measuring something that that doesn't increase with something that does increase points to btc being a net gain a store of value if nothing else meaning btc gains no further adoption i don't see how it doesn't serve the purpose of holding money printer accountable ok ok but there could be more crypto currencies i get this argument too technically the number of crypto currencies could approach infinity making btc a net loss if interest was distributed amongst those other currencies that's fine but i also don't see that as a threat i think there is inherent dominance in being the original i can't really articulate that thought much further thoughts this is caveman math i get it just wondering what else would be interesting to consider ,btc is a zero sum game,1.0,1,10a8t5i,astroportal_,0,2023-01-12 19:50:53,1673553065,1673553066,2023-01-12,19:50:53

bitcoin,bitcoin represents different things for everyone but in such a polarized world i find refreshing that people can stand side by side for something that they believe even though their reason to believe it is different some people here for having the option to keep their savings out of the hand of any institution some just believe the number will rise some actually think this will free people and provide everyone a better future a good thing about bitcoin that it aligns incentives and since the incentives are all aligned even if someone here for the altruistic reasons or selfish reasons it doesn t really matter and that s a good thing and i feel hope real hope for the future maybe for the first time of my life that we can still unite and build something together slowly but surely i have difficult time to understand why people care about it so much and feel the need to talk badly about it if they believe it will go to zero dollars i don t understand the hate or frustration behind it as a counter argument one can say the bitcoiners show a similar attitude towards shitcoins but i think the real frustration there is not related to the pricing of other coins the frustration is there because bitcoin represented and understood by lots of people under the umbrella of cryptocurrencies and the scammers using their fabricated and controlled currencies is damaging to what bitcoin is trying to achieve this is a long road and i myself still very new to this ecosystem and when you think about it and know everything started from people and now countries discussing it some accepting some refusing energy companies starting mining it feels difficult for me to go back to zero but as i said at the beginning apart from the price perspective it is really refreshing for me to be able to believe in something and do something for it it was something that i can feel lacking for my generation so i m happy to be be here and be a part of this journey ,my personal thoughts and feelings about bitcoin being ideology ,1.0,1,109ia51,lordkorhag,0,2023-01-11 22:37:35,1673476668,1673476669,2023-01-11,22:37:35

bitcoin,if btc one day would become the world currency but the coins are limited wouldn't that mean that the value would only increase as long as more people would be using it also first come first serve principle would apply which would mean that people who aren't born today their chance at success in life would be limited while some who are alive today and their descendents will own large amounts of this network making them incredibly rich powerful and corrupt and kinda the inheritors of earth and wouldn't this be a reason enough for noone in the future wanting bitcoin and wouldn't the only reason for bitcoin to still be the world currency despite this if it was forced upon everyone through force so basically the only reason why bitcoin would be the world currency is if it was forced upon everyone else and that everyone without bitcoin would become slaves to the people with bitcoin in the end is there something wrong with my logic sorry genuine questions here from a noob i'm just starting to read the bitcoin standard book ,if bitcoin truly would be the world currency just trying to imagine ,1.0,1,108mxg4,badbollsjoe,0,2023-01-10 22:21:06,1673389284,1673389285,2023-01-10,22:21:06

bitcoin,i invested in crypto since i am following r bitcoin of course and i appreciate btc as the first most important and safest cryptocurrency of all time i understand big investors who only invest in btc because it can provide them a lot of profit with relative small price changes and it has a big upward potential at the same time but for small investors it might make more sense to invest small amounts into altcoins with smaller mc higher risk but also bigger upward potential psychologically it's also more satisfying to own some millions or even billions of something than a small fraction of something if i would hit a lucky punch i would trade some of my portfolio to btc of course but the bearmarket was in the way up to now so that's why i never bought a single btc up to now i have only invested what i could afford to lose but of course it would hurt if i would lose it all should i change my investing strategy ,who else never bought a single btc ,1.0,1,108h7gu,calibre1972,0,2023-01-10 18:36:39,1673375809,1673375810,2023-01-10,18:36:39
bitcoin,indicators are a key component of technical analysis used to help traders and investors identify trends patterns and opportunities in the market but with so many indicators to choose from it can be overwhelming to know where to start one of the most basic and widely used indicators is the moving average a moving average takes the average closing price of a security over a set number of periods and plots it as a line on a chart this helps to smooth out short term fluctuations and reveal longer term trends another popular indicator is the relative strength index rsi which compares the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses to determine overbought or oversold conditions the rsi is typically plotted on a scale of with levels above indicating overbought conditions and levels below indicating oversold conditions but beyond the basics there are countless other indicators available each with their own unique capabilities and strengths some indicators such as the bollinger bands use standard deviation to measure volatility while others such as the fibonacci retracement use geometric ratios to identify potential levels of support and resistance it's important to remember that indicators are just one tool in a trader's arsenal they should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis such as price action and fundamental analysis to give a more complete picture of the market and while indicators can be helpful they are not always accurate and can produce false signals with that being said we believe that our ema velocity indicator is a powerful tool to help you make better trading decisions you can check it out on our website by clicking the link your website link we wish you the best of luck in your trading journey ,indicators understanding the basics of technical analysis,1.0,1,108fw0v,stocked-fish,0,2023-01-10 17:44:34,1673372691,1673372692,2023-01-10,17:44:34

bitcoin, from concept to reality the birth and growth of bitcoin the days of being tied to traditional forms of a currency controlled by governments are gone bitcoin a decentralized digital currency allows you to send funds from anywhere in the world to anywhere else instantly securely and with minimal fees if any at all but the story of bitcoin goes back much further than its practical uses it all started in with satoshi nakamoto who introduced the world to a decentralized network capable of achieving consensus without any central authority this concept known as the byzantine generals' problem in the world of computer science and distributed systems had stumped experts since it was first described in that is until nakamoto claimed to have found a solution initially met with laughter and dismissal nakamoto went on to publish software that allowed the creation of the bitcoin network just three months after releasing his groundbreaking paper aka bitcoin a peer to peer electronic cash contrary to popular belief bitcoin is not a company or organization but rather a standard or protocol similar to tcp ip or the internet it operates based on a set of mathematical rules agreed upon by all participants in the network thanks to this system and the invention of nakamoto bitcoin allows for a completely decentralized network of computers to reach a consensus on transactions happening on the network effectively determining who holds the money in this peer to peer network sending money from one account to another is as easy as sending an email there's no intermediary every minutes the entire network reaches a consensus on what transactions have occurred through a simple electronic election all without the need for a central authority but the real significance of bitcoin lies in its potential for a decentralized organization on a scale never before seen yes it can be used as a currency but it also has the ability to revolutionize voting stock ownership asset registration and even notarization don't get caught up in the fluctuating price of bitcoin the currency instead understand the revolutionary technology and network it has created amp xb since the inception of bitcoin the following consensus rules have remained unchanged a maximum of million bitcoins will ever be produced a target of minute block intervals halving events occurring every blocks roughly every years a block reward starting at and halving continually at each halving event until it reaches estimated to occur around amp xb any change to these parameters requires the consensus of all bitcoin participants so not only does bitcoin provide a decentralized network for financial transactions but it also has a decentralized system for decision making and rule setting amp xb hey there if there's something you're interested in let me know i'm always happy to write about different topics also i'm trying to post more on twitter so if you're into that give me follow me on twitter my handle is jpeg _tycoon i usually post times a week have a great day , ch from concept to reality the birth and growth of bitcoin ,1.0,1,10876zx,cyber_oligarch,0,2023-01-10 11:06:26,1673348799,1673348799,2023-01-10,11:06:26

bitcoin,hey all i've been going down the rabbit hole these past months there's a thought i'm trying to work through and i was wondering if someone could sharpen my thinking on this i would appreciate it if you could either correct any missing information or lapse in logic so i was listening to a debate between greg foss peter mccormack and peter schiff one of schiff's arguments was money can only work if its commodity money he gave the example that if the gold price for whatever reason starts plummeting it cannot go to zero reason being it will be bought up by industries for their use value namely electronics dental fillings and jewelry or sculpture art schiff claims bitcoin can go to zero because there is not use value in the physical world no one needs it for computer parts no one can eat it etc i find this argument to be incorrect i can't find the exact year but it seems like gold was first utilized as components in electronic devices in the early s that leaves thousands of years where gold's only use value was in dentistry and jeweler i think we can dismiss jewelry as a use case for gold why because jewelry is about signaling power and wealth why not wear a necklace made with fool's gold they could make it just as pretty with a nice yellow shine if there was another another magical metal in history that had all the properties of gold plus it was only accessible by a word phrase that only the bearer knows and can teleport it to the other side of the world would there be a demand for jewelry made from this magic metal meanwhile would the demand for gold jewelry go down considerably i think so it's accurate to say gold's properties as a money makes people want to make jewelry out of it not that people desire to make jewelry out of gold because its a beautiful shiny malleable metal gold jewelry is kind of a side effect or application of gold's value it doesn't seem like a use case to me because once gold's monetary value is gone most of the demand for gold jewelry will disappear in regards to dentistry there's a bunch of other metals that can be used including silver so the conclusion i'm coming to with this reasoning is other than dentistry gold was largely a useless rock up until it was used for electronics it functioned as a money for thousands of years because of it's chemical properties lend well to use as a money if gold has function with almost no use case in the real world for thousands of years why can't bitcoin doesn't this mean schiff's argument is kind of weak here amp xb one thing to add doesn't bitcoin have use cases in cyberspace there's facebook code that siphons data which is more valuable than a real world commodity like oil ,did gold really have use value before electronics ,1.0,1,107y52h,mike_woo_sculptor,0,2023-01-10 02:37:35,1673318267,1673318268,2023-01-10,02:37:35

bitcoin,as a crypto holder you are betting on the demand of the coin rising but there is no calculable value as a owner of a stock you have a legal right to the cash flows which then gives those calculable value if you believe a company will never grow and pay a dividend of forever and you want to earn it is intrinsically worth now things can go wrong with that forecast or improve and get a higher or lower return but the return estimate is based in verifiable mathback to crypto if you want to be inflammatory call it greater fool theory if you want to be fair you are betting on someone buying it from a higher price but there is no intrinsic reason as to why someone would pay more you don t get a pro rated share of the earnings of crypto there are none or a percentage of users or an adoption dividend or anything you just own a coin no different than a sports card the best example i can think that is similar to crypto but shows the difference in value with a stock is visa visa processes trillion in payments annually if you own the company the get a small percentage of that as they process more transactions all else equal it will be worth more with bitcoin or any coin if bitcoin increases it s volume you have no reason for the coin to gain value because you don t get anything logically by transactions going up your back to hoping someone will pay more than you did this is the main difference between stocks and crypto values historically assets that don t produce cash flows like gold or homes not rented grow at the same as fiat printing inflation lumber was basically flat over the past years excluding covid copper was nearly over the past years why should crypto be any different than other non cash flowing assets ,a legit discussion on valuation of crypto vs stocks vs non cash flowing assets,1.0,1,106tjk9,rifleman209,0,2023-01-08 20:36:38,1673210214,1673210214,2023-01-08,20:36:38

bitcoin,there is a lot of fear around setting up a multi sig wallet whether it's the setup itself or the fear of restoring the wallet from scratch it can be intimidating to move from single sig into the wonderful world of multi sig but it's worth it as your stack grows to be a more and more substantial part of your wealth so will the fear of losing your stack via a single point of failure with single sig i know that there are ways to create redundancy and security with single sig e g sd card wallet backups multiple seedphrase locations passphrases but i would argue that if you are willing to create redundancy and extra security with single sig you already have the motivation and likely the technical expertise to move to multi sig so enter multi vendor multi sig sparrow first why multi sig in general there are two major compelling reasons for multi sig redundancy from single key loss or theft this one is obvious plausible deniability in a wrench attack this second one was the main one that made me move to multi sig in the ever increasing world of data leaks and kyc it has become almost impossible to stay incognito as a bitcoiner having multi sig makes the effort to physically coerce you so much more difficult if an attacker has to transport you to another location especially if it's a public place like a bank security deposit box and as multi sig becomes the norm then physically coercive attacks become less tempting as a whole in the space second sparrow wallet makes multi sig setup a breeze to start it's open source the ui is so much more user friendly than electrum and it automatically prompts super important steps like downloading the backup script to restore the wallet it has been formatted to work seamlessly with almost all the major hardware wallets finally why multi vendor multi sig why not just coldcards in a of setup or trezors in a of setup by creating a setup where no vendor has a quorum of keys e g coldcards bitboxes trezor you remove that tiny little worry that one of the companies could be malicious and has somehow gotten your keys either via a usb connection or incomplete entropy at key generation or that you've been the target of a supply chain attack technically you should even be able to trust closed source hardware wallets e g ledger in a setup like this still recommending open source though as a matter of principle in the bitcoin space however if you go down this route these are the absolute imperatives to setting up a multi sig wallet you must backup your wallet and store a copy of all the xpubs preferably in both electronic and physical form if you need to restore your wallet from scratch you will need the xpubs of all the keys not just a quorum this is by far the biggest pitfall of multi sig luckily sparrow prompts you to create this backup at the time of wallet creation at least preferably all of your hardware wallets needs to be able to verify the multi sig wallet including the xpubs of all signers on the device i won't go into too much detail but malware could insert additional cosigners at the time of wallet creation so you need an external validation of the wallet setup hardware wallets that i know can do this from personal experience are bitbox coldcard and foundation passport i'm sure there are others but i can't speak to those this applies to both single and multi sig but you should always verify send and receive addresses on the hardware device itself i will plug for foundation passport on this one they make receive address verification via qr code very streamlined there's a lot more to the actual use of multisig including using psbts with certain hardware wallets but these actually don't differ from single sig other than having to do it multiple times rather than just once per transaction i could go on and on about other aspects of vs of storage location of keys seedless setups but this post is getting long if you are interested in seeing sparrow in action with multi sig here's a great video that finally prompted me to go with sparrow https multisig starts at ,multi vendor multi sig sparrow wallet one of if not the best self sovereign solutions to self custody,1.0,1,106kulg,realistic-jelly8133,0,2023-01-08 14:43:25,1673189022,1673189022,2023-01-08,14:43:25

bitcoin,basically there is a very large number of globally distributed nodes banks that transact with each other and that keeps a vee of their own ledger and they settle it every day or every couple of days to reconcile all the amounts yes not every bank has every transaction or every account balance but only those of their customers but still its distributed decentralized chained though not cryptographically so the only difference to btc is that btc has one ledger with everything it is cryptographically verifiable so it's trust less and its faster ok arguably the banks are actually the layer and clearing houses of the swift system are the layer which is more centralised than the banking system assuming the above is true then maybe a better way to explain btc is not by explaining the tech and blockchain etc but rather by saying something like btc is like an alternative to the swift system and its clearing houses that is decentralized open and not controlled by any one entity it is faster and fully transparent and if we say that then the question comes do the powers that be actually want competition in this manner not that they can stop it per se but they can outlaw it just like files haring cannot be stopped but be outlawed or made very inconvenient just trying to think of the appropriate analogy that btc is better than ,isn't the global banking system basically a blockchain as well ,1.0,1,103wh8c,anthonyhsiao,0,2023-01-05 11:14:12,1672917267,1672917268,2023-01-05,11:14:12

bitcoin,today we're officially launching a website called seedle io that enables people to enhance the security of their wallets by scrambling the order of their seed phrases based on a secret key the way it works is that a secret key generates a unique combination of scrambled numbers that map to the actual order of a seed for example the key hello world generates this combination gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt the sequence on the left side represents the false order and the combination on the right side represents the true order what we get is that instead of actually being the first phrase in the seed the combination reveals that the first phrase is at is at and so on note that the bolded in the th position is meant to be replaced with an incorrect phrase from the list of words this scrambled order creates a layer of cryptographic security that obscures the true identity of a seed the difficulty of guessing the correct order is or x to put that into perspective a computer guessing or combinations per second would take years to exhaust all possible combinations the best part of this security enhancement is that you do not need to enter your seed phrase anywhere all that's required is a password that only you know the rest of the process is using the combination as your seed and hiding it as usual or not here's mine column column measure earth kind satoshi mouse write violin human woman atom dinosaur devote alien royal cabin tornado brave engine month achieve law buddy gold cool check out our producthunt https campaign for more details and to share feedback the service will be completely free to use so please sign up for updates even if you cannot help fund the project tldr hash a secret passphrase to generate a unique scrambled combination that maps to the actual order of a seed ,an extra layer of security for recovery seeds,1.0,1,103thjx,seedle_io,0,2023-01-05 08:07:34,1672906065,1672906066,2023-01-05,08:07:34

bitcoin,hey all i recently set up my own lnd lightning network daemon node and have been learning about the best practices for managing and optimizing it one thing i've been struggling with is rebalancing my channels to ensure that they are evenly balanced and not costing me more in fees than they are worth after some research i discovered a really easy way to rebalance my lnd node using a tool called lnrebalance it's an open source command line tool that can automatically rebalance my node based on configurable criteria such as the minimum and maximum channel balance and the maximum fee percentage to use lnrebalance all i had to do was install it using the go get command and then run it from the terminal with the desired options it handled the rest of the rebalancing process automatically saving me a lot of time and effort if you're running your own lnd node and are looking for an easy way to rebalance your channels i highly recommend giving lnrebalance a try it's been a game changer for me and i hope it can help you too what tools or techniques do you guys use to rebalance your lnd nodes let me know in the comments ,effortlessly rebalance your lnd node with lnrebalance,1.0,1,1033jge,debaasmeister,0,2023-01-04 13:20:02,1672838416,1672838416,2023-01-04,13:20:02

bitcoin,id like to offer a few charts i've been working on for an open discussion all opinions thoughs and suggestions are welcome a few notes to begin orange vertical line is a halving date green line is top forecast for next cycle the date chosen is the average time to top from the previous halvings line of best fit is exponential looks linear on a log base graph chart y axis is log scale base first chart halvings top estimate k second chart halvings top estimate k third chart previous low to current low top estimate k discussion it's interesting to see the lower the timeframe that the chart looks back the lower the forecast high of the next cycle is i believe the reason is due to the diminishing blow off tops we are seeing from cycle to cycle i have a theory for that bitcoin network access to new funds the first cycle bitcoin gained access to a new pool of funds first movers the second cycle bitcoin also gained access to a new pool of funds through a rise in exchanges providing easy access the third cycle bitcoin gained access to new funds through a large increase in media coverage the fourth cycle current cycle bitcoin didn't gain access funds that would make as significant a step change to the price as it had in previous cycles as such the lack of blow off top in the current cycle effects the best fit price forecast more significantly when the time period examined is lower so where should the top estimate fall with such a wide range showing in the charts between k and k with no significant increase in access to new funds i'm looking at k as a top if several larger nations start to adpot btc as legal tender i'm looking at k as a top if several larger nations and institutions gain access through clear and favorable regulation then i'm looking at k as a top i believe on a log scale these events have a similar impact to the previously discussed events in past cycles such as first movers rise in exchanges and increase in media converage we are currently at k suggesting from the current value we see a increase to the top of the next cycle the better question i think is what should an exit strategy look like well we currently have days until the next halving and days until the estimated top based on previous cycles cycle was days from halving to top cycle was days from halving to top with years to top an exit strategy is a tough question to consider especially considering the swings in monetary policy over the last years for now i'm looking purely at the time to top and its correlation with the halving the halving event inherrently forms a supply demand crunch causing upward pressure on the price significant upward prices always lead to fomo and hence an overshoot on true valve as we have seen in every cycle the time duration of this overshoot has always been roughly the same in the btc space again amp days in the past cycles if there is one thing i am willing to rely on it is that human nature repeats itself this date for those curious is th of october what would have me re evaluate the estimated top date is if one of the aformentioned events large nations adopting btc and institutional access occurs months after the halving in which case i think we could see the top date pushed further out due to a late boom in access to new funds in this case i would start to look at the k to form the basis of my exit strategy rather than a set date let us know your thoughts as a final though provoker we often see an estimate cap put on btc due to its similarity to gold as a store of value digital gold the valuation of the gold market is roughly t however is estimated to be ish physical to paper ratio why do we not see this considered when corrilating it in a store of value sense to btc not financial advice ,btc price forecast amp discussion,1.0,1,102nhng,digital_oceans,0,2023-01-03 23:42:33,1672789365,1672789365,2023-01-03,23:42:33

bitcoin,if you consider the following from the manifesto gt the distinguishing feature of communism is not the abolition of property generally but the abolition of bourgeois property but modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products that is based on class antagonisms on the exploitation of the many by the few in this sense the theory of the communists may be summed up in the single sentence abolition of private property gt we communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man s own labour which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom activity and independence hard won self acquired self earned property do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form there is no need to abolish that the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it and is still destroying it daily fascinating that the discovery of bitcoin has single handedly destroyed the entire theory of the communism as for the first time in human history private property can be granted to anyone in the world as a true bearer asset and those rights will be upheld by the network regardless of your class background real world influence the hard work one puts into accumulating wealth to provide for and protect his family can be exchanged for a private property which is honest sound ethical grounded in physics and mathematics most people on this planet cannot access banking and that is the biggest divider of wealthy inequality because money is half of everything we do the simplicity of code has removed the marginalisation of the majority of people on this planet by establishing the same property rights for a multi billionaire in america and a poor farmer in nigeria while secured via true free market capitalism with the mining industry poor communities in rural areas are now able to tap into locked up natural resources that would ve otherwise gone to waste by expelling into the atmosphere and monetise the energy by mining bitcoin by implementing a system that respects true integrity soundness and honesty satoshi nakamoto has quite literally destroyed the main tenant of the communist ideology by providing property rights to billion people without exploiting a single being ,reading the communist manifesto through bitcoin lens is fascinating,1.0,1,100x9nv,itsnotthatdeepbrah,0,2023-01-01 23:47:07,1672616847,1672616847,2023-01-01,23:47:07

bitcoin,in which i was speculating on btc s usd price to exceed k in and eventually become the global reserve currency within years let get into it human beings have a hard time understanding exponential growth for a number of reasons one of the main reasons is that our brains are wired to think in linear terms we are used to things growing or changing at a steady rate and exponential growth does not follow this pattern exponential growth is characterized by a rapid increase in which the rate of increase itself increases this means that the growth becomes faster and faster over time a common example of exponential growth is the concept of compound interest if you invest a certain amount of money at a certain rate of interest the amount of money you earn will increase over time however the rate of increase will also increase so the longer you leave the money invested the more it will grow this can be hard for people to wrap their heads around because it goes against our natural instincts we are used to thinking about things in terms of how much they increase by a certain amount over a certain period of time exponential growth on the other hand increases by a certain percentage over a certain period of time which means that the rate of increase itself increases another reason why humans have a hard time understanding exponential growth is that it is difficult to visualize when we think about growth we tend to think about it in terms of physical objects or quantities that we can see and touch however exponential growth is not something that we can easily observe in the physical world it is a mathematical concept that is difficult to visualize which makes it harder for us to understand a further reason why exponential growth can be hard to understand is that it is often counterintuitive for example if you start with a small number and double it repeatedly the resulting numbers may not seem very significant at first however if you keep doubling the number it will eventually become much larger than you might have expected this is because each time you double the number you are adding a much larger amount than you did the time before finally humans have a hard time understanding exponential growth because it can lead to seemingly impossible or unbelievable outcomes for example if a virus were to double in size every day it would seem impossible that it could take over the world in just a few short weeks however this is exactly what can happen with exponential growth it may start off small but it can quickly become much larger than anyone could have predicted if you are still with me and are having a hard time connecting the concept of exponential growth to bitcoin let me explain bitcoin a decentralized digital currency has seen exponential growth since its creation in one of the main reasons for this is that bitcoin has a limited supply there will only ever be million bitcoins in existence and as more and more people become aware of and interested in bitcoin the demand for it increases this limited supply combined with increasing demand has led to the price of bitcoin experiencing exponential growth over time however this exponential growth has also made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin because of its non linear growth it is difficult to use traditional financial models to forecast the price of bitcoin this has led to a great deal of speculation and uncertainty surrounding the future of the currency another factor contributing to the difficulty in understanding the exponential growth of bitcoin is the fact that it is a relatively new and highly complex technology the use of blockchain a decentralized ledger that records all bitcoin transactions adds an additional layer of complexity to the currency this complexity can make it difficult for people to fully understand how bitcoin works and how it is valued the exponential growth of bitcoin has been driven by a combination of limited supply increasing demand and the complexity of the technology behind it this growth has made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin but has also attracted a great deal of interest due to the potential for significant returns on investment in conclusion humans have a hard time understanding exponential growth because it goes against our natural linear thinking is difficult to visualize is often counterintuitive and can lead to seemingly impossible outcomes it is important for people to understand this concept however because it can have significant implications in many different areas including economics population growth and the spread of diseases tldr exponential growth is difficult for people to conceptualize because it goes against our natural linear thinking is often counterintuitive and can lead to seemingly impossible outcomes btc has already experienced exponential growth multiple times and is still

bitcoin, the one that says people are selling btc before the end of the year for tax purposes to realize 'capital losses' gt in years characterized by significant stock losses from almost everyone's portfolio there's at least the small comfort of knowing that these losses can help you reduce your overall income tax bill gt gt according to u s tax law the only capital gains or losses that can impact your income tax bill are realized capital gains or losses something becomes realized when you sell it gt gt so a stock loss only becomes a realized capital loss after you sell your shares if you continue to hold onto the losing stock into the new tax year that is after dec then it cannot be used to create a tax deduction for the old year gt gt although the sale of any asset you own can create a capital gain or loss for tax purposes realized capital losses are used to reduce your tax bill only if the asset sold was owned for investment purposes gt stocks and btc fall within this definition that's why many people are selling before the end of the year and will buy back in january source https ,if the price starts going up tomorrow january first i'll start believing this theory ,1.0,1,zznfpu,s3k2p7s9m8b5,0,2022-12-31 06:25:21,1672467934,1672467934,2022-12-31,06:25:21

bitcoin,i should preface this post by letting folks know that i am not a coder that said however my concerns are that when newer versions of bitcoin core comes out you see bug fixes etc from the previous version but also there are occasionally changes to the rules of consensus this essentially means that if you upgrade to the latest version you effectively vote for that new rules of consensus from your version of what previously you voted bitcoin was imo there should be a differenent approach here when bugs are found why not update the older versions as well without touching the rules of consensus in said older versions you could still have the original versions available for reference however this approach would keep the bitcoin network safer and more robust while continuing to allow the individual node operators to decide what version of bitcoin is the true bitcoin which is the whole point aka decentralization for example i'm not a fan of taro or taproot in general for that matter in the bitcoin protocol so i don't run bitcoin core beyond a certain version unfortunately these versions have apparently since had bugs reported and remedied by later versions that said my concern there is that eventually my versions may have fatal bugs uncovered and the only way to keep bitcoin running is to upgrade to something that i would consider to be true bitcoin any thoughts on this would be appreciated in the mean time i'll continue to dca and take immediate possession of my private keys to ppkh addresses only which i generate offline as to forward this peaceful movement ,the bitcoin node rules of consensus make bitcoin well bitcoin however ,1.0,1,zxuezy,bitcoincansaveusall,0,2022-12-29 03:30:46,1672284665,1672284665,2022-12-29,03:30:46

bitcoin,bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses a peer to peer network to facilitate transactions and validate them through a process called mining it was designed to be a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies which are controlled by central banks and governments however over the years there have been concerns about the increasing centralization of the bitcoin network here are a few reasons why some people believe that bitcoin is becoming more centralized concentration of mining power a small number of mining pools which are groups of miners that combine their computing power to increase their chances of finding a block have a significant proportion of the total mining power on the network this concentration of mining power could potentially allow these pools to manipulate the network and make it more difficult for smaller miners to compete influence of large exchanges a small number of large exchanges such as coinbase and binance dominate the market for buying and selling bitcoin these exchanges have significant control over the price of bitcoin and can potentially manipulate the market to their advantage dependence on a few key players some key infrastructure providers such as bitmain and blockstream have a significant influence on the direction of the bitcoin network these companies control important aspects of the network such as the development of the protocol and the operation of key infrastructure which could give them disproportionate power over the network limited number of nodes while the bitcoin network has a large number of nodes a significant proportion of these nodes are run by a small number of organizations this could make it easier for these organizations to coordinate and potentially exert control over the network overall while bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized cryptocurrency there are concerns that it is becoming more centralized as the network has grown this centralization could potentially undermine the decentralized nature of the network and lead to more centralized control over the network ,bitcoin being centralised,1.0,1,zxd5n4,lilcutie_677,0,2022-12-28 15:59:27,1672243186,1672243187,2022-12-28,15:59:27

bitcoin,good morning i've been in bitcoin for less than two years so i just don't know enough to discuss some topics but i wanted to make a statement about how privacy is key to bitcoin success bitcoin is meant to be a form of electronic cash sent between peers its main goal is to grant people a way of exiting the fiat system at least partially and in order to do so bitcoin needs to be antifragile but bitcoiners need to be like that too cause there is no bitcoin without bitcoiners you can make sure nobody is taking your btc away by taking your coins into self custody and that's true but many people who have been on the space for much longer assure that having your keys its already enough i strongly disagree with that you need privacy to be antifragile if your coins are kycd you are an easy target for anybody with enough knowledge to trace you government included many think nobody is going to take the time to trace you in that way well i think they will as soon as you do something they find disturbing enough and bitcoin success is something they will find so very disturbing i can't express properly how important a good privacy is for a bitcoiner and i am so worried that the main voices in the space usually just don't care about it cause you only need privacy if you are doing something wrong first of all that's a lie and secondly well who says what's wrong the only way they won't go against you at some point is if they don't know who to go against ,privacy in bitcoin is more important that you think,1.0,2,zwfr3u,wilfow,0,2022-12-27 13:33:23,1672148018,1672148019,2022-12-27,13:33:23

bitcoin,as the world becomes increasingly digital it's no surprise that the demand for virtual currencies like bitcoin is skyrocketing and with the recent news of major companies publicly backing bitcoin it's clear that this trend is only going to continue but let's be real the skyrocketing price of bitcoin isn't just a passing fad it's a sign of the times and a testament to the bright future that lies ahead for this revolutionary digital currency you see bitcoin is more than just a means of exchange it's a symbol of the changing financial landscape a beacon of hope for a more decentralized and equitable world and as more and more people catch on to the benefits of bitcoin it's only natural that the price will continue to rise but it's not just about the price bitcoin is also a powerful tool for financial freedom allowing individuals to take control of their own wealth and transact without the interference of banks or governments and as the global economy becomes increasingly unstable it's clear that bitcoin is the safe haven that people are turning to so don't be fooled by the naysayers and doubters the future of bitcoin is bright and the price will only continue to climb higher and higher get in while you still can because this train is only just getting started ,light on bitcoins future,1.0,1,zvh3kk,finaldecade,0,2022-12-26 06:40:10,1672036825,1672036825,2022-12-26,06:40:10

bitcoin,how does lightning btc fix its exchange rate at a physical point of sale i am assuming that most retail merchants are still thinking in fiat and converting the dollar amount into sats in a dynamic manner so as to protect against fluctuations of the usd btc rate however assuming i go to the restaurant and it says a steak is sats but by the time i finished eating and chatting the equivalent dollar value would have put it at sats at point of payment how does the merchant covers itself ensuring it gets the same fiat amount my guess is that the prices are always quoted in dollar and the sats equivalent is calculated at point of payment but this means i might stay at restaurant until such time that the exchange rate is favourable before leaving and if another patrons think the same way it would be a checkout nightmare ,how does merchant fixes its exchange rate when using btc with lightning for payments ,1.0,1,zuhgol,lespaul97,0,2022-12-24 19:59:25,1671911978,1671911978,2022-12-24,19:59:25

bitcoin,the link i have shared as part of this post really made me stop and think today it's an estimate of listening and non listening bitcoin node if you consider yourself a bitcoiner this should worry you what you see is a slow decay of a statistic that should be growing year on year especially now when people are moving to self custody as the shitcoins die and when people are seeing the true value of bitcoin as a tool of freedom the misconception about running a node is that you are supporting the network but it's not really about that running a node is you exerting control it's you saying these are my rules this is what i want bitcoin to be and if many users engage this selfish act bitcoin becomes stronger that's the magic right there look at the blocksize wars at the big blocker corporate interests signalling for segwitx look at the rbf nonsense as people who don't understand the risks and function of bitcoin try to dictate how the network should work node runners are the main line of defense against these actors you can be there in the phalanx in fact you should be there with a spear in hand ready to strike at that which you must fight a shield locked with those you would share concensus with if you do not run a bitcoin node you are allowing the essence of bitcoin to rot through inaction for your sake for the sake of your bitcoin and critically for the sake of bitcoin's soul run a node you don't need a raspberry pi you don't need an old computer you don't need to run linux or make a sever or any of that shit what you need is to download bitcoin core from bitcoincore org for your os verify it and install it congratulations you now operate a node if you can't spare the disk space prune it can't dedicate the bandwidth don't propagate blocks don't want people to know you use bitcoin enable tor the possible configurations are huge and there are tools to help you configure it as well wallets like sparrow will easily connect to your node too so you can effortlessly have privacy in your transactions too aren't sure what you are doing don't worry ask for help here go to the daily thread go to the r bitcoin discord ask ask ask people will help you and then one day pay it forward i have included some helpful links to get you going but if you are new to this whole thing and have questions then please ask away why you should run a node how to run a node how to run a pruned node if you cant spare disk space remember there may come another blocksize war it may happen sooner than you think be prepared to make yourself self sovereign or face the consequences of inaction to quote sartre we're 'thrown' into existence become aware of ourselves and have to make choices even deciding not to choose is a choice ,think bitcoin is inevitable think again complacency is the enemy of bitcoin ,1.0,1,zturtd,callingvoid,0,2022-12-23 22:40:38,1671835251,1671835252,2022-12-23,22:40:38

bitcoin,cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have the potential to revolutionize the financial systems for those who really need it one reason for this is that many people in these countries do not trust their governments to control their financial systems responsibly in many countries the level of corruption is high and resources are often times mismanaged cryptocurrencies offer an alternative way to store and transfer value because of this block chains like bitcoin are decentralized and not controlled by any single entity thus providing a level of security and transparency that is often lacking additionally cryptocurrencies can increase financial inclusion in developing countries many people in these countries do not have access to traditional banking services either because they are too expensive or because they are difficult to get cryptocurrencies offer a way for these individuals to participate in the global economy even if they don't have a bank account finally the use of cryptocurrencies can also help to reduce the risk of fraud and other financial crimes in developing countries because all transactions are recorded on a public ledger it is much harder for fraudulent activity to go undetected overall the future of cryptocurrencies in developing countries will be insane they offer a way for people to store and transfer value in a secure and transparent way all while increasing financial inclusion ,bitcoin is good for those who have the least,1.0,1,zs7238,godking99,0,2022-12-22 00:44:55,1671669912,1671669912,2022-12-22,00:44:55
bitcoin,people who say so keep considering pools as a unique entity while it is true that someone leads the pool it is wrong to consider all miners to blindly follow regardless of what happens let's consider an attack on the bitcoin network of more than blocks reverted if a pool leader was to attack following miners would mine blocks on a hacked blockchain after a few blocks the hacked blockchain might become the longest one difficulty speaking the hacked chain would get considered as a fork by all honest nodes because it would imply a reorg higher than honest nodes would automatically discard the hacked chain the word would spread on all social medias than an attack is going on everyone would manually check they are on the good chain at the same time miners in the hacking pool would start taking action no miner would want to mine on a worthless chain and a majority of miners are honest thus they would quit the pool the power of the attacking pool would fall dramatically after that the fork would not receive enough difficulty mined to keep up with the good chain and would die i think this whole attack cancellation could be put to work in less than a few hours plus the attackers would lose insane amounts of power to mine on a chain that loses in the end let's remember than the majority of our miners want to make good if they didn't we would punish them anyway so they will never tolerate their mining power to be used by a malicious pool as soon as a pool is labeled as malicious it's over that makes their leader completely powerless and that makes proof of work the system with the highest nakamoto coefficient achievable ,nakamoto coefficient is way higher than ,1.0,1,zs6x0p,mubelotix,0,2022-12-22 00:39:07,1671669564,1671669564,2022-12-22,00:39:07

bitcoin, the increasing hash rate of the bitcoin network the hash rate is a measure of the processing power of the bitcoin network and it has been steadily increasing over time this is an important factor because it helps to secure the network and makes it more resistant to attacks the halving event the halving is a programmed reduction in the rate at which new bitcoins are generated which occurs approximately every four years this event is significant because it reduces the supply of new bitcoins which can lead to an increase in demand and in turn a higher price rapid adoption rate the adoption rate of bitcoin is often cited as being faster than the adoption rate of the internet in its early days this suggests that more and more people and businesses are starting to recognize the potential of bitcoin as a means of payment and store of value increasing mainstream acceptance bitcoin is becoming increasingly mainstream with more businesses accepting it as a payment method and more user friendly platforms and products becoming available potential to replace traditional global currencies there is a growing belief that bitcoin has the potential to replace traditional global currencies in the next decade due to a waning faith in elite centralized banks and a lack of government accountability bitcoin offers certain advantages over traditional currencies such as its decentralized nature which makes it resistant to inflation and manipulation by governments or financial institutions overall these factors suggest that bitcoin has the potential to continue to rise in value in the coming years while it is difficult to predict the exact trajectory of any asset the increasing hash rate halving event rapid adoption rate increasing mainstream acceptance and the potential for bitcoin to replace traditional global currencies all contribute to its potential value in ,there are several key factors that suggest that bitcoin is likely to be valued at over in and could become the global reserve currency in less than years ,1.0,1,zs4joq,neckcrafty5641,0,2022-12-21 23:06:06,1671663984,1671663984,2022-12-21,23:06:06

bitcoin,i know that ideally mining should be done by more individuals but its getting so competitive that even if you buy an sj pro it would take you over a years just to break even on the cost of capital then you would start making money the problem is people with significant amounts of capital make it ultra competitive for an everyday household miner to justify the costs and means i wish a company would develop a new technology that would be x efficient and half the wattage but the key component would be that it would only sell the miners per household as a limit such that corporations and large players couldn't such up all the hash rate then it would make sense for millions of people to have miners and it would distribute the mining across a lot more people who could being in pools anyways but then it would decentralize mining further i hope someday some company comes in and does something like this it would be cool to have miners in all households just like an everyday modem food for though d,distributed btc mining dream,1.0,1,zrw3gr,okspot2437,0,2022-12-21 18:10:26,1671646239,1671646239,2022-12-21,18:10:26

bitcoin,hi bitcoiners i am very interested in running a full node and i need quite a bit of help i'm not a super tech heavy person but i understand some of the nuances so here is the issue i have i began downloading the timechain and got to about at this point the core client said it would be about weeks before the whole chain would be downloaded fyi i plugged in my ethernet chord and this did not help my computer specs mac mini gb ram gb storagei decided to save the chain to my external hard drive that has tb of storage it had no problem saving it there until the issue around i read that this can cause the chain to be stored much more slowly plus the ibd can go slower when processing power is being used up by other computer functions i think i might have a solution i have two monitors hooked up to my mac mini i have concluded that it might be best to buy a mac mini because it has a hard drive that i can remove and replace to something larger ideally tb of storage i can then hook my monitor up to the mac mini download core and the timechain and then hook my monitor back to my original mac and allow the mac to just run as a full node this would be great to have a ui whenever i want to look at the node and it would have the full gb of ram and tb of storage from the mac i'm trying my best to keep my mac clean from large downloads because it's my work and personal computer and given my current storage situation i would only be able to download a third of the chain before i am at capacity amp xb what do you see as a problem what do you think would be a better solution i've read that raspberry pis are good but i don't know how to use it and this mac is roughly only so not too bad for what i want to use it as is it better to just download the timechain to my external hard drive on my current mac and wait the two weeks before it's fully downloaded advice thanks in advanced ,help running full node,1.0,1,zqynkd,shoopyvras,0,2022-12-20 20:25:14,1671567931,1671567931,2022-12-20,20:25:14

bitcoin,bitcoin maxis love the idea of bitcoin becoming a widely used as a deflationary currency and it is often compared to gold as a store of value let s look at the history of the gold standard as a comparison specifically the departure from the gold standard leading up to and after wwii the gold standard was swapped for the bretton woods system until it was erased by nixon in the early s executive order enacted under fdr required all americans to submit their gold to the federal reserve bank after the war the bretton woods agreement signified a change in the global system in which all countries in the agreement were required to guarantee convertibility of their currencies into u s dollars with the dollar convertible to gold bullion for foreign governments and central banks at per troy oz wikipedia this means all countries exchange for u s dollars backed by redeemable gold but that gold is only redeemable by banks and governments not your average citizen now my question is highly theortecial what if the u s enacted a similar order for bitcoin in the wake of a collapsing global market and it was made illegal for citizens to hold bitcoin the government pinning the value of the dollar at a certain number of satoshis there would be a branch of the federal reserve devoted to mining rogue mining operations would be highly illegal and other countries would compete for maximum mining outputs this would have dramatic effects on the development of the cryptocurrency industry and on the world there would be many negatives and positives what do you think i dont actually think this will happen but its an interesting scenario keep hodling ,bitcoin exchange standard,1.0,1,zqx5ei,numberonejewboi,0,2022-12-20 19:24:54,1671564310,1671564310,2022-12-20,19:24:54

bitcoin,tldr let's have a discussion regarding the trend in price volatility not price for btc and ware its heading i would like to see some good analysis on this btc has been the best performing asset in modern history but this has come with volatility like no other this volatility while it lasts is very much a once in a lifetime opportunity for those who can buy and hold over the long term even if they don't time the market particularly well but better if they do that said it's my understanding that volatility is generally decreasing year by year while this is generally regarded as a good thing for increasing the adoption rate of btc it also means that the oportunity presented by said volatility will lesson over time we see a lot of price projections during the bull runs at least but i don't see many volatility projections yesterday i was playing around with the simple annual percentage growths on chart and adding a trend line i'm not going to post it here because i didn't keep the results and i wouldn't consider my method to be particularly savey it was all very rudimentary and not anything i would hang any credibility on i simply observed that yes volatility is decreasing and therefore the expected rate of annual growth would also likley decrease going forward this doesn't mean that btc isn't still an amazing investment oportunity in addition to all its other societal benifits monetary freedom store of value etc but it does mean our growth expectations shouldn't be as high as we observed in the last three halving cycles i say expectations because there are always external factors disasters wars new tech that can affect short term price in iether direction i guess what saying is it would be interesting to see more competent analysis regarding the volatility trend and ware its heading ,discussion projecting the reduction of price volatility,1.0,1,zqux25,jarviez,0,2022-12-20 17:56:29,1671559007,1671559007,2022-12-20,17:56:29

bitcoin,here's how it would work they print a couple billion dollars they buy a million hardware wallets each wallet buys a few hundred thousand sats then an army of bureaucrats sends the sats back and forth to each others' wallets over and over again producing far more than transactions per second and that's all those bureaucrats do all day it's their job and they could then afford to attach super uber crazy high fees to each transaction say worth of sats per transaction essentially crowding out anyone who wants to use the bitcoin network to send their own transactions it would drive the fees sky high through the roof which would cause most ordinary people to be turned off from using bitcoin if they kept this up for a few years it would stifle the network and no one would want to use it because you'd have to compete with those high fees which are artificially driven up by governmental action it really seems to me that this could be the most effective way for the government to attack bitcoin with just a couple billion which is a drop in the bucket for the us govt hell powell could crank that out in a keystroke they could make every fee for an entire year be more likely far higher seriously transactions second about million year so for a little over a billion they could make the fees be at least on each transaction making it prohibitively expensive to use the network for any small transactions what are your guys' thoughts on this ,what if the us federal government attacked bitcoin with a throughput attack as in clog up all the transaction throughput with a bunch of dummy transactions in order to slow down the network and thus discourage it's usage ,1.0,1,zqtab5,ronpaulwasr1ght,0,2022-12-20 16:50:51,1671555070,1671555070,2022-12-20,16:50:51

bitcoin,i'm trying to understand some things about bitcoin and i've been searching for days watching videos reading articles none of them have explained it to my absolute understanding it's frustrating question transaction inputs where exactly do the inputs come from i learnt they are utxo's unspent transaction outputs from previous transactions which transactions and to whom does every payment that comes to me generate a new utxo so for example if people have recently sent me btc to a single address i own do i have separate utxo's to spend use as inputs for my next transaction that was my reasoning and it seemed to be making sense until i came across info that said the inputs can come from different addresses huh okay looks like they have a point though because when i check the block explorer for transactions i actually see distinct addresses as inputs and outputs it should mean that every address can rather only have one utxo at a time right and multiple utxo's should definitely come from different addresses but if multiple addresses are used as inputs shouldn't all of them be owned by the sender because only the sender should authorise a transaction now if that's the case how is that done because with the wallets i've used trust and binance i don't see an option to select multiple addresses i own and combine their value when i'm sending btc so what's happening can multiple inputs only be achieved using low level coding or something when i search for how to send bitcoin from multiple addresses or similar i don't find anything that answers my question it's as if that's not possible i'm just not getting it for the outputs i understand but the inputs haven't really been explained to me can someone who understands this from a to z spell it out for me without leaving anything out i'd be really grateful amp xb question block confirmations and reversibility many sources say that transactions that have or more confirmations can be considered irreversible okay logically that should mean that with less than confirmations the transaction can be reversed now what i know about block confirmations is that it's the number of blocks that have been added to the blockchain after the one that contains the transaction in question so that means even with one or two confirmations the block is actually on the public blockchain right so if the transaction can be reversed how is that done will it be pulled down from the blockchain funny question what would happen to the blocks after it meanwhile if you search for can bitcoin transactions be reversed all the answers you get are no so what's really the point here ,i have big questions about bitcoin transactions ,1.0,1,zql2gk,xor_dinary,0,2022-12-20 10:31:16,1671532292,1671532292,2022-12-20,10:31:16

bitcoin,do i have the following correct in this hypothetical future bitcoin is the medium of exchange and store of value in a country the vast majority of people just save money since there is no more government induced inflation prices of all goods are relatively stable except in natural disaster situations and supply chain fluctuations the financial investment industry has shrunk exponentially there are still people who are investors and provide this expertise for a fee or commission it is extremely transparent where each satoshi of your taxes go to public entitlement programs are very limited and completely funded as the money supply is almost predictable now publicly funded pensions are almost unheard of there are a lot more private companies providing what were once largely publicly funded services such as public safety banks still exist but their business model is more about pooling investor funds and providing a bitcoin custody service for the people who don't feel comfortable holding their own coins bitcoin custodial services are a big deal as personal home robberies are now fairly commonplace banks are not required to have a reserve ratio but customers understand that if a bank does not then they may lose their money if something happens to the bank banks are nowhere near too big to fail anymore people can choose to invest their bitcoin into various projects to try to multiply their wealth and they understand that they can lose their money if the project fails end of story there is a free market for interest rates loans are largely sourced from private lenders and or banks but there is no more central bank nor a national interest rate decided by a small group of people there is still a stock market because companies still have the freedom to try to publicly fund their business ideas but it's no longer the behemoth that it once was as money is hard money and isn't as easy to come by as it once was are their big holes in this economic model i'm sure i'm missing important parts as it's impossible to summarize an economy feel free to add your own thoughts and ideas i enjoy discussing these kinds of things thanks ,discussion on an ideal economic model for our future,1.0,1,zq1fyp,compassionisthekey,0,2022-12-19 19:44:30,1671479085,1671479085,2022-12-19,19:44:30

bitcoin,im thinking of getting a coldcard since it seems to be the most safe way to store btc ive been doing my research and it turns out that factory reset is not an option so you must use the wallet as you receive it yes i know you can check the source code from github to check if its the original and it also comes with some tamper evident security measures to make sure your coldcard is legit when you receive it my main concern is what stops the creators from coldcard stealing your funds in the future so we cant trust an exchange cause not your keys not your coins but we must trust a developer of wallets how do we know that embedded in the source code there isnt a backdoor or that when they make a firmware update you end up giving up your seed phrase and balance to them no just coldcard but any harware wallet maker like trezor or ledger do we change trust from an exchange to a hardware wallet manufacturer ,coldcard wont allow factory reset,1.0,1,zq0xts,therabbithole-512,0,2022-12-19 19:25:19,1671477932,1671477933,2022-12-19,19:25:19
bitcoin,i've been seeing a lot of new people that seem to have no grasp on the basics of economics regarding currency what gives it value etc i posted this as a comment in another thread that didn't get much attention so i thought i would post it again as its own post to help those who are new to bitcoin or don't have much understanding of the fundamental value proposition of bitcoin as a currency first you need to ask yourself why the dollar has any value learn a bit about the history of money the first currencies were commodity money they derived their value from their intrinsic use but they were cumbersome to use so we invented paper money that was backed by commodities such as gold which could be exchanged for it and gave it value in the us fed stopped allowing dollars to be exchanged for gold making our money fiat money with no backing fiat means command it is created out of nothing by an issuing authority now think about what the federal reserve has been doing and the effects their actions have had on the economy they previously lowered interest rates to interest rates are the cost of obtaining money money that has no cost to obtain has no value and an unlimited supply the money supply has been increased by more than over the last years and much more than that over the previous century you can view the fed's own data here the value of the dollar over the long term is trending toward zero along with every other fiat currency look at this chart and see how much value it has lost over time https most money is already digital it's just a database in your bank's servers that has names associated with amounts less than of the money supply exists as cash it would be impossible for everyone to convert their electronic deposits into cash banks actually create extra money in the money supply when they make loans reserve requirements were suspended in the covid era meaning banks could create unlimited amounts of loans with no reserves at all this is stuff you would all learn in an intro economics class but it's very fundamental to understanding why any currency has value or loses its value money derives its value from being something that is fungible durable divisible portable and limited in supply the more of these properties it has the better it is as money it must serve as a unit of account a medium of exchange and a store of value the better it is at these things the better it is as money bitcoin has all of these qualities making it useful as money it's much more divisible than the dollar much more portable and more limited in supply so far the bitcoin network has never had a major outage or hack it is free and open source with out a central authority so far its value has only gone up over the long term despite its high volatility in the short term limited supply is essential a currency's potential as a long term store of value many countries have hyperinflated their currencies with disastrous results right now around the world many countries are experiencing extremely high amounts of inflation learn about what has happened in argentina venezuela zimbabwe hungary and many more countries due to hyperinflation it's a crisis around the world almost all the world's countries use fiat currency now many people in these countries face authoritarian governments or do not have access to a stable currency bitcoin has obvious usefulness to these people as well as anyone else who wants an alternative to fiat money that will do nothing but lose value over time ,the basic economics of why bitcoin has value,1.0,1,zq0gf4,future-iterations,0,2022-12-19 19:07:06,1671476842,1671476842,2022-12-19,19:07:06

bitcoin,due to bitcoin's hard cap if bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency and all things become naturally priced in bitcoin this would mean that each bitcoin and each sat will become more and more valuable as the economy grows i know assuming the economy will grow indefinitely is not as trivial as i'm making it sound but let's just assume it'll be the case for this thought experiment so basically things will cost less and less bitcoin and we will reach a point when a single gummy bear will be worth less than sat at this point we'll need a smaller unit in order to pay for everyday stuff even a cup of coffee will be worth less than sat eventually hell you could say that about almost anything if you go far enough in the future assuming the human race survives till the universe ends so my questions are what's the code change needed to make this a reality is it just changing some value on a line of code in github and then of course the majority of the nodes accepting the change if so where is that line why wasn't bitcoin made infinitely divisible in the first place are there some technical issues that would arise if this was the case what's the reasoning behind choosing million per bitcoin as the lower limit and not million or billion ,assuming bitcoin will need a smaller unit than sats eventually how does that look from a technical point of view ,1.0,1,zp1ow0,21_mil_btc,0,2022-12-18 15:58:44,1671379137,1671379137,2022-12-18,15:58:44

bitcoin,ok basic question here to my knowledge btc requires miners to validate transactions proof of work and mining requires an expenditure of energy which costs generally some kind of fiat currency as bitcoin halves and becomes harder to mine the relative profit margin approaches the cost of mining further fluctuations in the value of btc potentially means putting miners underwater versus the cost of mining electricity hardware what happens when the cost of mining outstrips the profit of btc say the cost of mining one btc is btcs in the relative fiat currency if miners drop out and transactions cannot be validated the relative exchange value of btc is thus since no exchange can take place is there something i'm missing here this seems like a weakness inherent to pow crypto especially btc which has a growing cost to mine based upon the halving aspect of the hash mining further i cannot think of a real world counterpart since exchanging gold isn't incumbent on anyone mining it in fact as gold miners drop out the cost of gold would increase due to the effect of scarcity i'm sure i'm missing something since this seems like an obvious real threat to crypto as an investment vehicle at least proof of work models that rely on mining to validate exchanges transactions ,question concerning solvency of bitcoin ,1.0,1,zom6ui,alpharustacean,0,2022-12-18 01:17:17,1671326254,1671326254,2022-12-18,01:17:17

bitcoin,hey everyone i just wanted to share my thoughts on bitcoin with the community as a fairly new bitcoiner myself i am constantly amazed by the resilience and strength of this revolutionary digital asset one thing that really stands out to me is the decentralized nature of bitcoin unlike traditional financial systems that are controlled by a small group of individuals or institutions bitcoin is powered by a global network of nodes that work together to secure the blockchain this decentralization ensures that no single entity has control over the network making it resistant to censorship and corruption another aspect of bitcoin that i find particularly impressive is its ability to act as a store of value while the price of bitcoin can fluctuate in the short term its value has consistently increased over time making it a reliable investment for the long haul but perhaps what i love most about bitcoin is its potential to bring financial freedom to people around the world in countries with unstable currencies or oppressive governments bitcoin provides a way for individuals to take control of their own wealth and financial future overall i am bullish on bitcoin and can't wait to see what the future holds for this groundbreaking technology what about you guys why do you love bitcoin ,feeling grateful for bitcoin,1.0,1,zo7x6u,xxshadowassassin69xx,0,2022-12-17 14:53:39,1671288830,1671288830,2022-12-17,14:53:39

bitcoin,i've always stayed away from bitcoin since it didn't make sense to me glad i've been vindicated a great lesson relayed by mike harvard business school not long ago a merchant found a lot of monkeys that lived near a certain village one day he came to the village saying he wanted to buy these monkeys he announced that he would buy the monkeys at each gt gt the villagers thought that this man must be crazy how can somebody buy stray monkeys at each gt gt still some people caught some monkeys and gave it to this merchant and he gave for each monkey gt gt this news spread like wildfire and people caught monkeys and sold them to the merchant gt gt after a few days the merchant announced that he will buy monkeys at each gt gt the lazy villagers also ran around to catch the remaining monkeys they sold the remaining monkeys at each gt gt the merchant then announced that he will buy monkeys for each gt gt the villagers start to lose sleep they caught six or seven monkeys which was all that was left and got each gt gt the villagers were waiting anxiously for the next announcement gt gt then the merchant announced that he is going on holiday for a week but when he returns he will buy monkeys at each he also said that his employee will be in charge and would take care of the monkeys he bought pending his return gt gt the merchant went on holiday gt gt the villagers were frantic and very sad as there were no more monkeys left for them to sell at each as was promised by the merchant gt gt then the merchant s employee contacted them and told them that he would secretly sell them some monkeys at each gt gt the news spread like wildfire as the merchant promised on his return that he would buy monkeys at each they would achieve a profit for each monkey the next day the villagers queued up near the monkey cage gt gt the employee sold all the monkeys at each the rich bought monkeys in large lots the poor borrowed money from money lenders and bought the rest of the monkeys gt gt the villagers took care of their monkeys and waited for the merchant to return however nobody came then they ran to find the employee however he was not to be found gt gt the villagers then realized that they have been duped buying the useless stray monkeys at each and were now unable to sell them gt gt this monkey business is now known as bitcoin ,a coworker emailed me this today i don t think people quite get it yet ,1.0,1,zntn22,enjoyin_my_coffee,0,2022-12-17 00:30:12,1671237024,1671237025,2022-12-17,00:30:12

bitcoin,the dependence on the government s ability to print money has created an unbalanced master slave paradigm where the people are forced to involuntarily finance the government s money printer this reliance on government printing has effectively removed the accountability of public entities as they no longer work for the people but rather the money printer the government s ability to endlessly print money without repercussions means that the people no longer own their government the lack of checks and balances in the system has caused public entities to instead look to outside sources such as corporations wall street foreign nations and the military industrial complex for extra money similar to a side hustle for a paycheck this creates a conflict of interests as the people no longer own their government and the government is now working for the money printer not the people this is why there is such a disconnect between the government and the people these days the people are increasingly feeling unacknowledged and unheard and this is due to the government s reliance on its money printer public entities are no longer accountable to the public as they only strive to please the money printer the good news is that there is a solution to this problem and that is bitcoin by creating a decentralized monetary system the people can take back ownership of their government as the money printer no longer holds the power bitcoin creates an environment of financial freedom as the government no longer has the power to control the money supply furthermore it creates the transparency that the government and the people need in order to work together in conclusion since the transition from hard money to fiat money the government has become a master and the people have become its slaves public entities are no longer accountable to the people as they now work for the money printer however with the introduction of bitcoin the people can once again take back ownership of their government and create a more transparent and fair relationship between the two parties ,who works for whom ,1.0,1,znqnpq,andrwuz,0,2022-12-16 22:14:04,1671228862,1671228863,2022-12-16,22:14:04

bitcoin,one of the easiest attack possible on all blockchains is the replay attack it basically takes advantages of hard forks to use a valid transaction from one of the chain and broadcast it to another let s take an example we create an hardfork called bwef bitcoin wef of course our shitcoin will be shorted on market and nobody will supports it but like ethw people will know they can sell it and get fee money you have btc so you received bwef trading each for k for free let s dump it quick so you wanna swap you bwef on a website for free money houray in order to do this you have to send your bwef by creating a transaction and signing it you then sell and get your dollars so you got your k for a shitcoin you didn t want anyway that s just a win right but here is the issue your transaction is public and is also valid on real btc chain so now an attacker can broadcast this same transaction on original chain this could be the buyer of your bwef now the buyer as received your bwef and your real btc you re sold your btc for k so now let s talk about how to protect from this afaik there is no way to protect from what i just describe the only thing we can do is to avoid interacting with forked chains which can be difficult because most people don t use their own node so when signing and broadcasting a transaction they may be sending it to a node of the forked chain so if someone knows more about this and would like to correct me share infos like how to protect or anything please do i think this would help greatly community ,replay attacks on blockchains,1.0,1,zmzhpj,tyranoc4,0,2022-12-15 23:14:26,1671146085,1671146085,2022-12-15,23:14:26

bitcoin,the only thing i think is missing about bitcoin technology is a way to really slowly recycle itself let me explain imagine in thé far future when all bitcoins will be mined or almost the biggest bitcoin sources available will be old storages from our time old account lost bitcoins etc they will probably be an industry trying to found them back in a way or another the amount of lost bitcoin will be massive and compared to thé mining production they will be a time where finding only a single one hard wallet from our time could be worth of multiple year of mining production this is not a sane balance for an economy the non lost bitcoins will be used for thé economy but if they are btc holders who are too big they will own a too big of thé total amount of money to exist let s say a familly for exemple that inherited bitcoin from generation to generation they could or own stupid amount of things or acting by themselves as a modifier of bitcoin value orders of magnitudes too high probably with the ability to make prices triple or divide by easily if a money like this exist in far future propose who are not privilegied by it will legitimately look away for other solition and probably create other cryptos collectively and decide to use them instead what would be a imo sane thing to do is adding a evaporating rate to bitcoin let me explain to avoid that few peoples could own too massive proportion of bitcoins and keep the currency viable and fair enough to let peoples continue to use it we could maybe add a system who could make a small évaporation raté happen so for exemple each year of the btc you own evaporate and go back to the mineable bitcoin pool numbers can vary this will also allow a renewable and constant suply of new btc this is the most equal option everyone have the same evapotax we could also balance this in a more fair way like evaporzting bitcoin faster for biggest bitcoin holders above some cap to avoid peoples to squeeze this by dividing their wealth into multiple account we will need them to be or nominated to a single person or to a single family and a way to make sure it is not squeezable then let s say that for each time you own x more than the average account balance to let this method grow with increasing of decreasing population you pay twice more so per year evaporate of your btc above time the average balance above time the average above time the average k m time thé average etc etc evaporate per year at million time the average at million time at a billion time etc that also add an incentive to make thé average peoples wealthier so it will be really hard to own more than a billion time the average person wealth who seem like a minimum to keep things somehow balanced of course that s random number that could be adjusted up or down that will keep the economy somewhat balanced and allow more evaporation to happen and at the same time still allow for big fortunes to exist but without having too much inequalities capped in this exemple at billion time the average because after that evaporate per year so basically all of it we could maybe even imagine a system where the under average balances get a small percentage of wealth evaporated from big one we could say that like half evaporation go to mining and half to slightly lower inequalities could be a modest redistributive and fair economical system we need also a way to make peoples who die inherit their fortune to their kids to avoid the death peoples accounts to count among the total number of active accounts and if not possible redistributed to the mining pool this way we could have a monetary system bitcoin like with a fix amount of currency a way to slowly get back potential lost bitcoins trough evaporation a way to slowly give back bitcoin to the mining pool and keep the suply running a way to avoid too much inequalities but still allowing fortunes to exist without allowing too indecent ones or monopoles to a way potentially to redistribute a part of the wealth to the less fortunate trough a part of the evaporation we could call this condensation on lower than average or average balanced account this will be a low amount in any case because lower than average account and average account will be much more in number than the above ones who pay for it and that s how you keep a currency system sane stable and fiable for extremely long periods of time and make it automatically adjusted to total population number changes up or down allowing humanity to eventually becaume a multi planetary specie as we should be if we are not filtered out of existence before and that s how you also assure peoples to be able to keep a stable decentralised predictible non inflationist currency who evaporate or not at all or reaaaly slowly depending on how rich you are also putting a smaaaaal pressure on peoples to spend or invest and keep the money moving in the economy being rich is this world would only mean owning a bigger part of the cake who evaporate faster and of nothing is done or if badly used or lost will go back to average with time trough evaporation who go half to the less fortunate half for the miners who keep the thing working a bitcoin made on this kind of system could be much more viable long term and even becaume a ultimate and universal currency alway adjusting itself to any situation to go back to the society wealth distribution programated in some years and still of course remunerating miners and mining who make the system work and continue to that s an interesting topic imo and could be the solution to a lot of issue that today currency have or even cryptos have or even decentralised cryptos have excuse my bad english ,bitcoin in the far

bitcoin,this is probably a dumb question but if you move bitcoin to a cold storage wallet then i understand that it is not on your computer anymore and that this is more secure as you can't get hacked unless somebody gets the cold storage drive and knows how to get in but if you move bitcoin to say an electrum wallet and save the seed phrase on paper somewhere or in your head and then you delete the electrum app completely from your computer then also you would not be able to hacked via your computer if somebody gained access to it so what really is the difference or pros cons of the approaches is there anything wrong with just deleting the wallet app and not spending extra money on a cold storage device since you can always recover the wallet with the seed whenever you want access to the bitcoin by reinstalling the wallet software ,difference between cold storage and no storage ,1.0,1,zmxlnm,peelman1978,0,2022-12-15 22:07:04,1671142044,1671142044,2022-12-15,22:07:04

bitcoin,lately i have been having a bit of an existential crisis with the true utility of the blockchain i was initially drawn in by the digital goldrush but like many i stayed because i really believed in the future of crypto as this bear market has progressed i have been filtering through the junk as i dive deeper into crypto and blockchain technology i am starting to see less how the blockchain has real utility here are a couple of my opinions i would love if somebody with more knowledge of the space could refute anything i say with evidence possibly crypto's greatest strength is the decentralized network and ability to process instantaneous transactions this is especially useful for large payments and international transactions the problem is there no easy way to convert bitcoin to fiat without using a centralized exchange the argument would be that eventually we could use bitcoin or other tokens as transactional currency but we are still far from there needing to rely on exchanges to convert bitcoin to fiat comes with many of the problems that come with transferring money to begin with at the end of the day unless you are transferring crypto from one wallet to another and the receiving party plans on just holding the crypto it offers very little improvement to wire transfers the second issue i have is with linking tokens or nfts to physical goods despite the blockchain being a brilliant and secure way of tracing transactions since there is no way to link a real physical world item to the blockchain it makes tracing items impossible i often hear about using blockchain in regard to the supply chain assuming a qr code is used to track certain items the qr code can always be removed or recreated it would also rely on always scanning the qr code to track it if the code is not scanned then the transaction will never show up in the case of digital items like nft art it costs so much energy to upload medidata on chain that it is not feasible most nfts rely on medidata servers to store the nft which makes the whole point of having a blochian pointless to begin with you can t hide the medidata for confidential documents you don t own the copyright to the nft in a legal sense and you can t prevent anybody from copying the medidata you own on the blockchain this leads to the last point which is most if not all crypto projects are creating solutions to problems they invented aside from the obvious pump and dumps even legitimate projects do not offer real world value it seems like so much of crypto relies on the narrative that we will be socializing transacting and living more in the digital world most projects assume one day their project will be useful while that may be the case it seems like we are still far from living in a ready player style world i don t know of any projects except bitocin that that solve a problem that exists today and solves the problem in a way no other technology could to summarize it seems like crypto is a cool technology that has very little practical use in today s world i still love the crypto world and i want to believe in it but i am seeing less and less a true use for it as i take off the goggles and try to look at everything from a practical and productive point of view the argument for crypto is becoming less and less clear to me please educate me on what i am missing because i know i really am looking to learn ,help me believe in blockchain technology again,1.0,1,zm3pw5,maninja2,0,2022-12-14 22:06:40,1671055617,1671055617,2022-12-14,22:06:40

bitcoin,bitcoin vs cbdcs spycoin coming soonso we already have micro cbdc s in the form of social security benefits ebt disability income among other government subsidized programs cbdc s would basically be the united states dollar except there will be more rules in regards to how exactly you can use a cbdc for example there may be a limit to what type of items you can buy you probably won t be able to buy liquor or tobacco with a cbdc if you are it will probably only be on the weekends in the afternoon or something parental like that bitcoin is important because while a cbdc is basically a dollar that impinges on your privacy the bitcoin network makes sure your payment will be accepted no matter what imagine an international bank that never closes and audits every transaction every minutes to ensure the validity of the network that s bitcoin jerome powell controls the price of money so he could arguably be the most powerful man in the world the issuance and regulation of cbdcs by central banks could give governments too much control over the flow of money in the economy this could allow governments to track and monitor individual transactions in a way that could infringe on privacy rights another potential concern is that the widespread adoption of cbdcs could make it easier for governments to implement harmful monetary policies such as negative interest rates negative interest rates can have detrimental effects on the economy including reducing the incentive for individuals and businesses to save and invest bitcoin is a global currency that can be used and accepted anywhere in the world whereas cbdcs are tied to a specific country and can only be used within that country's borders this makes bitcoin a more attractive option for individuals and businesses that operate internationally or want to conduct business with people in other countries the use of bitcoin is pseudonymous meaning that transactions can be made without revealing the identity of the parties involved this can provide a higher level of privacy and security than transactions made using a cbdc which would be subject to the same regulations and oversight as transactions made using fiat currency cbdcs may be perceived as a positive change in the financial system but in actuality it will create more problems than solutions bitcoin offers a permissionless decentralized and everlasting alternative that gives users more control over their own funds and provides greater privacy and security and that makes the world a better place ,bitcoin vs cbdcs spycoin coming soon,1.0,1,zluqap,mathmaticmorpheus,0,2022-12-14 16:01:38,1671033712,1671033712,2022-12-14,16:01:38

bitcoin,bitcoin is all about understanding and managing your own risk and trust be that the decision to run a node or not use a light wallet or not a company node wallet or not you also have to decide who you will give your business to and what risk you're willing to expose yourself to when engaging with bitcoin services with that in mind let's conceptualize a few different kinds of bitcoin services so we know to look out for them and can make educated choices as consumers the low trust service this is a bitcoin service delivered in a low trust manner where the bitcoin user need only utilize software they run and control for the services and can protect themselves from malicious third parties with very little trust or consequence from peers this is the gold standard of bitcoin service examples include lightning routing lightning liquidity marketplaces like pool coinjoins like joinmarket coinswaps submarine swaps like loop and others when at all possible this is the kind of service you want to run many services and contracts in bitcoin or layers will claim to be low trust even decentralized which isn't all necessary for a business they are supposed to be centralized but very few are ask yourself what recourse you alone have against fraud and what fraud would be possible for example in lightning you protect yourself from fraud by watching the blockchain and storing proof of your off chain transactions you can broadcast at will you have responsibility watch the blockchain and recourse publish transactions proving fraud and claim balance the risks revolve around your own capacity time delays locking up your coins and other general inconveniences not impacting your custody trust the service will be provided this is your typical business or website where you pay for the good or service before you get it and have little to no recourse if the service is not provided pretty normal you're risking whatever you're spending in a transaction examples include every merchant business accepting bitcoin the merchants using btcpay server and non custodial exchanges like bullbitcoin https this is also a very good model with limited risk but often little recourse the federated trust service this is a bitcoin service which spreads responsibility across a number of actors for success or failure it's not nearly as good as trusting yourself and relies on third parties to protect your interests examples include liquid rsk https peg multisig custodians bisq escrow these services often delve into shitcoins and when they do should be avoided like any other the risk in these cases is often not exceptionally limited include custody and your recourse relies on third parties if any exists at all the first party custodian this bitcoin service relies on only itself it often prides itself on this self reliance boasting a lack of third parties and self custody river financial is a good example if you can trust the one business these can be quality services the risks in these custodians are similar to a federated service but only trusting one party the rd party custodian this is a bitcoin service which relies on a third party custodian like prime trust https examples include strike and swan https among many others while both are bitcoin only companies the custodian they rely on holds over shitcoins https these kinds of services can be dangerous because they can appear to be very bold bitcoin only companies but on closer inspection you will find they don't self custody a central tenant of a good bitcoin participant in the space user and business alike this can expose users to all kinds of risks and broadens the number of actors exposing users to risk even if it's not just custody for example kraken just leaked user data https via a zendesk leak this is why evaluating who you are trusting is important and i make these specific examples to illustrate why you can't take even well respected community members at their word you need to evaluate for yourself are you trusting them or a tower of service providers the shitcoin casino this isn't a bitcoin service at all it's a public harm these are exchanges which service and host scams exposing their users to the custodial risks of their shittiest shitcoin they often print their own shitcoins they lure users in with too good to be true fees they should be avoided at all cost examples include coinbase binance kraken gemini kucoin and many many others most others i won't be linking them because you shouldn't use them tl dr as you evaluate what kind of businesses and services you want to use what risks you're willing to expose yourself and your coins to and hopefully even what kind of businesses you want to encourage in this space consider all your options not every service has made the same trade offs or requires the same trust consider minimizing your exposure to this contagion and not only get off exchanges and custodial services but reevaluate the services we're doing business with in the first place avoid shitcoin custodians and services use lower trust solutions let's do more diligence on who we are trusting and how ,trusting bitcoin services

bitcoin,hey everyone i'm fairly new to how bitcoin works and with everything that's happened recently it's no surprise i'm in the same boat as a ton of people withdrawing from exchanges but i'm trying to understand more of the inner working of bitcoin as i find the tech fascinating i withdrew all my funds from ftx thankfully on time and more recently binance and chose trust wallet as i found their multi coin wallet from a single mnemonic an interesting idea and the app looks and functions great the only downside is that there's no way to access some of my wallets from the extension so i went with electrum to get my bitcoin address on my computer here's where my big confusion lies when i imported my wallet from the mnemonic i got a bunch of wallets the first one being the one trust wallet gives me i assume that's how hd wallets work however when converting my bip mnemonic to a bip seed importing that seed in electrum still works but i get completely different addresses is there any logical explanation to this a friend of mine suggested maybe electrum does something to the seed but that possibly can't be the case i'd hope as a side question somewhat unrelated but i'm also wondering when i created a wallet on trust it gave me the mnemonic as it should maybe i'm too skeptical but how is trust supposed to know it can't give the same mnemonic to someone else how is it made sure that no other user from any other software hot wallet app will ever get the same mnemonic as me thank you for your time to anyone that can help me understand those amp xb ps i know i will get scammers and whatnot in dms i won't reply to anyone in dms so no need to tell me in the comments if that can spare you some writing i'm also aware i showed my balance in the screenshot it's there to show that the top window imported from the mnemonic does contain the wallet trust gave me and that the bottom one imported from the seed does not thank you again ,understanding wallet imports from bitcoin hot wallets,1.0,1,zl5xfi,momoske,0,2022-12-13 20:26:00,1670963178,1670963178,2022-12-13,20:26:00

bitcoin,bitcoin vs michael burry investing in freedommichael burry a k a the big short is so cool except he s not actually most people know michael burry for predicting market crashes like the great financial crisis in because he s been successful in predicting downturns in the market burry has been christened the big short of the financial markets but i m beginning to think that his new nickname should be called the big slave owner in fact he s a sadistic egomaniacal psychopathic slave owner who doesn t care about anything but making a return on what he feels will be the best investment that the free market will allow slavery sometime in the second quarter of michael burry bought more than shares of the geo group geo a private prison operator geo group was the only stock he held as of the end of the second quarter of most of the emotionally detached financial analysts and journalists will find reasons to justify his slave owning position they will say something like a recession is possible soon so this investment makes sense because it does make sense an increase in crime is directly correlated with a lack of job opportunities in a particular area so if job cuts continue to rise in america there will probably be a slight increase in the crime rate in the united states but investing in the deliberate disenfranchisement of other human beings is the worst type of investment you can make this isn t about the roi this isn t about the progress on your quarterly statement this is about investing in the empowerment of the people or in the enslavement of them when has investing in slavery ever been a good idea in america the land of the free it costs about per year to house a prisoner i don't know about you but i'd much rather be investing that type of money in the next generation of technological advancement can get you bitcoin which is an absolute bargain and a much more sustainable long term investment than prison labor bitcoin is changing the way we value traditional services that were available to us this includes accounting auditing and our civil rights bitcoin is the quintessential asset that allows any human being to become their own sovereign bank by owning bitcoin you unchain yourself from financial institutions that control your money in a world where people invest in slavery to gain a yield on their depreciating dollar bitcoin is freedom in the form of money fighting back for your god given rights despite roi degenrates like michael burry bitcoin is lighting a path for all humans that are debt slaves to a flawed monetary system and that makes the world a better place ,bitcoin vs michael burry,1.0,1,zjxzn7,mathmaticmorpheus,0,2022-12-12 12:42:19,1670848951,1670848951,2022-12-12,12:42:19

bitcoin,since bitcoin had a price people have tried to recreate it but with twists like the owner of this one gets a huge chunk of supply then supply gets released when mining or this one has this cool development team or technology behind it therefore better than bitcoin these recreations all focused on the idea of bitcoin as a technology when in fact even the technology used to run bitcoin is subject to change at the whims of social consensus take robux for a minute robux is a popular digital asset issued by the robux corporation it has exchanges though mostly underground for fear of reprisal from the robux corporation what is the functional difference between robux using an sql database between their servers and robux using a private blockchain where only robux servers can create the proofs of work for transfer its still permissioned robux still has full say over whether transfers even happen between accounts and robux is still sold by the robux corporation crypto is much more akin to robux in this way crypto is not subject to the whims of its userbase it is only subject to the corporation behind it bitcoin does not work in this way bitcoin is a social construct the bitcoin core devs have done a pretty good job at making sure nothing that would upset the people who run the software gets through but what would happen if they did new rule block sizes will now be gb instead of mb the first problem they'd run into is that the new software is not compatible with the software everyone else is running people who run the software would be pretty upset at hard drive space filling up rapidly and fork the project into a new repository you now have two chains but which chain is bitcoin so that's what i mean when i say bitcoin is a social construct any argument you'd make over which gets to be bitcoin is you enforcing that social construct the current construct around what is bitcoin is that the chain that is compatible with the older software gets to be bitcoin amp xb wait but the original bitcoin github repo gets to be bitcoin i hear you scream so lets talk about the next problem the original repo would encounter from ignoring the people who run bitcoin when you use a bitcoin wallet and you don't run your own node you use the node that software wallet defaults to now maybe that software wallet enforces the idea that bitcoin is the core repo but it could just as well decide to enforce the social construct that bitcoin is whatever is compatible with an older version of the software in fact it probably would do this by default via not noticing that a new client was even released i mean i can't help but notice that this very sub has a link to download version of core even though version was released miners and price i can't talk about the role that miners would play into this without also including how the price of each chain would effect the miners if users prefer to use one chain over the other its price will go up which makes miners want to mine that chain instead of the other one this means the chain that goes against the users wishes is vulnerable to the hashpower of the chain that supports user decisions being part of the dominant monetary network has its perks amp xb the dominant monetary network is evidence of the strength of the social construct at hand right now the strongest social construct for money is that government issued paper is money bitcoin is here to challenge that social construct with its own ,bitcoin is a social construct not crypto,1.0,1,zj27qc,nerd2ninja,0,2022-12-11 18:10:53,1670782265,1670782266,2022-12-11,18:10:53

bitcoin,hi guys i just want to inspire this subreddit with a interesting thought i got a few weeks ago the question i wanna discuss today is in times of rising surveilance do you think that non kyc bitcoins will have a higher price in the future compared to kyc bitcoins why should non kyc bitcoins should be more worth at all let's say you want to buy bitcoins and you meet someone for a pp trade i e from localbitcoins an attacker i e governments could try to blackmail the seller of the bitcoins to force him to reveal the identity or at least distinguishing features and data of the buyer this sounds weird and exaggerated i know but take a look at the last years please don't get me wrong i don't want to say that this case is a real danger but i also want to say that i would never refuse it as an actual danger everything is possible i hope you are as interested as me in this discussion let's see if we can collect some inspirative thoughts together ,let's discuss non kyc bitcoin vs kyc bitcoins in terms of price ,1.0,1,ziz4eo,exchange_rec,0,2022-12-11 16:46:02,1670777180,1670777180,2022-12-11,16:46:02
bitcoin,that's why i encourage you to try out wallets that privatize your bitcoin like wasabi or samourai they use technologies like coin join and route your payments in a private way they are different and one can be better than the other one for your purpose but if you are using tools for privacy you are already ahead of the mayority of the users the lightning network also takes privacy a step ahead also dyor because i didn't explain how they work technically maybe on another post this one is for you to know that there are ways to keep our privacy on the bitcoin protocol stay safe in boats accidents there are getting common ,privacy is a bigger concern day by day,1.0,1,ziz2zv,fmorenol,0,2022-12-11 16:44:55,1670777107,1670777107,2022-12-11,16:44:55

bitcoin, sorry my english is not great but i needed to express myself here i was and i am still kinda hyped and amused by how ln could be the scalability solution for bitcoin it is just so versatile and fast and it actually works like a charm for me i fucking like using it butthe thing is with lightning users are not able to easily run a node and take custody of their funds lightning does not promote decentralization and without decentralization we are not talking about bitcoin i personally have my lightning sats on a custodial lightning wallet and i think that's the case for almost every ln user that is not the way on chain btc is easy to have in self custody and a bitcoin full node is something everybody can run in their house as it has little to none maintenance required on the other hand a lightning node is some complicated shit which only some hardcore enthusiasts can run properly i think ln makes sacrifices in terms of decentralization that are just too much and although it hurts i think it is not the way at least as it is right now ,disappointed with ln,1.0,1,ziyg75,wilfow,0,2022-12-11 16:27:02,1670776036,1670776037,2022-12-11,16:27:02

bitcoin,this post is for those who have been tipped maybe the tipper linked this post to help you or you want to learn more about lntips on the bitcoin sub r lntipbot for more official information non wallet use you can start right now without set up you just need someone to tip you i recently discovered there is a tip bot that you can use in the bitcoin sub and i think others the great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning wallet and then withdraw your tips or use your own lightning wallet to add sats to your personal tip jar you don't need to if someone tips you sats then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your username and add in sats to it that's the minimum tip then you can use the same command in a message and tip someone else no need to even set up a wallet you can use sats all you want just from your own tips get them and pass them on side note you can send private messages to the bot and it will give your balance or a code to send sats to or receive sats via lightning wallet just using the links on the bot reply to tip type lntip or any number higher than it will tip the person you are replying to if you don't have the funds available in your account for the tip then the bot creates a lightning invoice that you can pay using lightning wallet use with a wallet setting up a lightning wallet and adding sats to the bot a great guide from double lr tip him if he posts in comments i use muun too so you are in luck it works a very small bit different than you think i am on a phone so this is what i just did to transfer sat from the tipbot balance to my muun wallet very easy you ll see prior to doing this you must have the wallet fully set up get your seed phrase words aka your keys and write them down and keep them safe then do the rescue emergency pdf thing too it s pretty easy and worth the hassle of figuring it out after that open muun and select receive at the top there are two option buttons select lightning and the screen will change to a lightning address at the bottom you will see invoice settings select that and you will see a button to add an amount and an expiry time for the invoice press add and enter the amount you want to withdraw from the tipbot balance press confirm and the invoice will change again to the address that represents what you just created an invoice for the amount of sats you entered press copy and the invoice will be copied to your clipboard in your phone open reddit and find a tipbot message it has the blue links in it you see it every time a tip is given press withdraw and it will create the dm format for you once you learn the format very simple you can create it from scratch like a normal dm but the blue link does this for you until you learn the format well enough to create it on your own on the dm page created by the blue link there is a spot that says put_invoice_here delete only that simple phrase and then paste in to the same spot and your invoice you copied earlier will appear the line that says withdraw needs to stay where it is press send open muun as fast as you can and see if you can beat the withdrawal to your wallet from reddit enjoy fellow redditor it seems like a lot but i m reality steps will become step for you and steps will also become one step for you so once you learn it it s basically two steps lightning is badass enjoy fellow redditor general help some useful faq type information not included on the bot website if you are clueless then hopefully this list will give you enough information to start to google the gaps in your knowledge what is bitcoin it's a digital commodity like gold but much easier to transport what are sats each bitcoin is made of a million sats like dollars and cents but with lots more sats per bitcoin to make payments easier what is lightning the bitcoin nextwork is slow and super secure great for transfer of large amounts of money but not good for tips and coffee so clever people built a second layer on top and that is the lighting network it allows you to send sats super fast and cheap what is a bot an automated service to help you don't worry about sending messages to it as long as you don't change the words it's just like sending a command to a computer and it will return your answer privately do i need a wallet perhaps not you can be given tips and then check your balance here on reddit and only tip others using your tips a great little circular community but then i do need a wallet yes when you either have so many tips on your reddit ln bot account wallet that you want to withdraw them fully or use them in the real world then you will need a wallet or if you have no tips and want to tip then you will need a wallet what's a reddit ln bot account wallet the clever people who made this tip bot made it so you automatically get a little wallet just for use with the bot only attached to your username that the bot can use to track your tips and balances smart what's a lightning wallet a lightning wallet probably an app that you can install the app allows transfer of bitcoin sats to any other wallets great for buying stuff in locations that accept bitcoin sending bitcoin or sats to your friends l and for sending sats to fill your tip account where do i get a lightning wallet when youre ready to use one google it and find one you like anything else to know only one last bit if you tip more than you have availabille or you try to make a deposit clicking and sending deposit as a message to the bot then the clever bot will give you a long number code that you can copy and enter into your lightning wallet app to make a payment when you do you will have used bitcoin and passed a tip to someone else how nice of you the code

bitcoin,i ll preface by saying i m not an ftx user but i do have my theories about what happened the fact that money was being sent to alameda instead of ftx to me means the scam was planned from the beginning what im unsure of is whether the money was stolen or lost on bad trades im guessing it s both i have some suspicions i wanna throw around here i figured this would be the best place to get feedback on it the main thing i feel people reading this needs to understand is i believe sam planned to use ftx as a crypto slush fund which leads me to the following as i understand it ftx had a lot of derivative futures and leveraged products these products track the price of an underlying asset and can be complex to me it s quite a stretch of the imagination that sbf was actually taking all of the underlying positions that you could take on ftx if he was gambling with everyone s money anyway i don t even know how you d accomplish some of it in crypto so was that a scam too any ftx users on here that can comment my question is essentially do you think sbf was letting people place bets on the price of tokens without there actually being any underlying transactions cause if that s the case then it makes sense why he deleted everyone s balances and trade history and i m also wondering if you were able to go on ftx with a small amount of collateral place a ridiculously leveraged bet get it right and cash out your money whose money was that got cashed out ,how big was the ftx scam ,1.0,1,ziic55,gonja619,0,2022-12-11 06:35:01,1670740515,1670740516,2022-12-11,06:35:01

bitcoin,blockstream published an article about how a signing device might leak users private keys the premise of this attack is straightforward a hardware wallet can leak the user s secret key by carefully constructing its signatures since the compromise happens during signature generation rather than key generation even if the user verifies that her keys were produced from strong randomness e g by generating her seed words by rolling dice and then importing them into multiple wallets to ensure they produce the same addresses it is still possible to execute the attack the solution blockstream is proposing to this isn't quite right though it involves trust in the manufacturer and trust in the software if that software is closed source the solution to this is much more obvious than this novel attempt to secure against it the solution is open source software that is easy to compile and flash onto the device and open source hardware that is easy to verify via a visual inspection against a reference like i said in a comment to a post before https i'm not going to talk about particular exploits because i believe defending against the hacker methodology itself is the best thing users can do especially when exploits are known to attackers but not to defenders don't let this scare you away from using bitcoin just get better at your own pace keep your stack at the size you know how to defend a larger stack has justifies a more paranoid threat model ,key exfiltration how a signing device could leak a private key,1.0,1,zhwjy4,nerd2ninja,0,2022-12-10 16:22:43,1670689377,1670689377,2022-12-10,16:22:43

bitcoin,i'm new to this part be kind i just made my first real transaction it was a small one just trying things out i want to wipe the device and recover it to make sure everything is working and get familiar with the ui i did it once before i transferred and the phrase worked so i figured that's a good start the transaction only took a few minutes from start to finish so that was nice i wasn't expecting instant but i'm glad it wasn't hours like some people have said when i made the transaction the provider said est fee was less than cents when the wallet received it it said the fee was a lot more but i received the total amount and the first provider didn't withdraw more is that common what happened is the rest of the fee going to be removed taken later does the fee increase the more it is confirmed why on one page did it say the fee was much higher and then on another it says i saved on the transaction i received it in the wallet before i got the transaction id is that normal i looked at the transaction id it was in a batch or a pool is that normal i found my own part of it very cool but it said it was a used address how can it be a used address since it is my first time in previous attempts the provider asked me to choose a network with this provider it didn't ask it just made the transaction which worked because i received it but does that have something to do with the different reporting of fees the transaction amount was a lot more than i have what happened here there is a lot of information on my ''receipt'' how much of that is vital how much should i pay attention to are there specific things i should check everytime any ids i should take note of its showing me a bunch of types and what looks like a bunch of different transactions is that normal what determines the types it only has a couple confirmations how many should it have how did i have it in my wallet before it was confirmed this transaction was small tester one should i make multiple small ones or fewer total if i make multiple transactions will it use a different address or reuse the already reused one that should have still had its digital cherry intact i've been sitting here for far too long scratching my head is there a bitcoin for dummies type reference i can read like with everything self custody is making me feel like i know far too little the exchange felt like a casino now i'm starting to feel some responsibly i realize i don't know sht about sht and should probably be phoning a friend but i don't have any i'm the only person irl i know that knows even remotely anything about the coin some of you read like you know what you're talking about and your knowledge would be appreciated ,started moving off exchange i have questions ,1.0,1,zhlq0b,big_ad9737,0,2022-12-10 07:08:37,1670656134,1670656135,2022-12-10,07:08:37

bitcoin,i recently stumbled upon the meme 'is this good for bitcoin yes ' and i believe it's a phenomenal meme it's so simple yet incredibly clever that's it that's the meme this meme says it all it doesn't matter if people talk shit about bitcoin what matters is that people talk about bitcoin because whether they talk positively or negatively bitcoin will be mentioned and every mention yields awareness in marketing this is called a 'brand touch point' it takes a long time for a new product until mass adoption happens new customers first need to hear about get interested research and finally make a purchase decision that doesn't happen over night the first step before anyone can start his bitcoin journey is therefore awareness you don't start your bitcoin journey unless you see bitcoin in the news or hear friends talk about it amp xb amp xb the diagram shows that every sale is offset by attention interest desire and conviction from frank hutchinson dukesmith editor of salesmanship as bitcoin enthusiasts we tend to forget that we all started at zero at some point do you remember when you first heard about bitcoin you probably read an article that was shitting on bitcoin and you dismissed it you see it's just normal that bad news is part of the journey but bad news is good news and here is why the purchase funnel feels like it has been around forever it is in every marketing course book and is mentioned at least once in every client meeting so when a client exclaimed it feels like we ve used this thing for years i decided to check turns out we have well marketers anyway years to be exact whether you call it the customer funnel sales funnel marketing funnel aida or just funnel each serves the same purpose the funnel shows how a customer ultimately makes the decision to buy a product source amp xb bad news is good news because it still helps bitcoin at the very beginning of the funnel is awareness and bad news help to make people aware that bitcoin exists the streisand effect is a name for the phenomenon in which attempts to hide censor or prevent access to something have the opposite result the unintended consequence of drawing far more attention to that thing here is a hypothetical example of the streisand effect someone posts an embarrassing photo of a celebrity online around people see it the celebrity takes legal action to enforce its removal upon learning of the legal action the media covers the story as a result millions of people seek out and view the photo the upside the celebrity will see the number of followers increase and his or her popularity rise following the news the streisand effect is a great example of how trying to hide or prevent access to something can actually end up drawing more attention to it this phenomenon can be seen in many different contexts but one of the most interesting examples is the way that the media often tries to talk shit about bitcoin at first glance it might seem like the media's constant criticism of bitcoin would be bad for bitcoin after all negative news stories can often have a negative impact on people's perceptions of a particular topic however when it comes to bitcoin the opposite seems to be true every time the media talks shit about bitcoin it seems to only end up drawing more attention to it and increasing its popularity so let the haters come they all feed the algo ,bitcoin always wins even if the media talks shit about it,1.0,1,zgxw4x,ymerglobal,0,2022-12-09 13:52:13,1670593949,1670593950,2022-12-09,13:52:13

bitcoin,i ran my own lightning node for over year so i have so personal experience with it and the model works is it's simplicity but i strongly believe that it sucks the entire channel system sucks the main reason is how shit is it to actually have a node to spend unless you have a ton of sats to create a big channel to a place you will use frequently you are gonna end up needing to reopen channels all the time and won't be any better off than using on chain this leads to the use of services like loop and those are both expensive and risky if you look at the trend too centralization in lightning is overt where big nodes grow bigger over time because they provide the least amount of jumps and the most usefulness for most spend user i honestly don't think the channel model is going to survive contact with hyperbitcoinization ,the lightning network is fast but it kinda sucks ,1.0,1,zgeor2,davirus,0,2022-12-08 22:52:56,1670539988,1670539988,2022-12-08,22:52:56

bitcoin,so from what i've gathered there's multiple catalysts for bitcoin price next year despite a looming recession which is a fact at this point first one is the halvening obvious by the end of there should be the peak and preceding that hopefully a long upward trend towards a minimum of k per bitcoin according to models that have a historical price accuracy of bitcoins value should peak at around m per bitcoin in average recession lasts for around months so by the time this one will be over bitcoins price should be around k at the end of next year beginning of second one is the gaap accounting standard next year this law will be improved so that companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet will be able to write them at their fair value currently if the price goes down in value but jumps back up again companies have to write down the value of the digital asset and can't mark it up starting from next year it will be different which apparently has been a deal breaker for institutional investors in the past third one is the capital inflow of traditional investors like investment banks pension funds central banks small big countries and different funds currently holding digital assets in their portfolio is considered to be risky due to the absence of regulation transparency public disclosings from the beginning of next year january the united states congress will be having a session where the sec and congress will both fight over which entity gets to set the rules they both seem to be in a hurry to be the first ones which is a positive for crypto investors as the institutions feel safer to invest the capital inflow should be somewhere around trillion usd for the price to reach k at the end of next year current price would have to quadruple so approximately trillion usd would be sufficient total amount of assets held by mutual funds in the us is trillion usd germany has trillion and uk amp brazil and switzerland collectively own trillion usd that's close to trillion if of this would go to bitcoin its price would quadruple another scenario would be where we would consider the multiplier effect x of investing in the stock market in which only billion of capital inflow from institutional investors would be necessary to reach a trillion market cap x billion usd trillion i included switzerland because its central bank has said it's interested in acquiring bitcoin there's a few other potential catalysts in the future that might shape the perception of cryptocurrencies to a positive in the coming year big countries like iran russia adopting cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and the pilot of cbdcs also ukraine is one of the largest bitcoin holders so there are multiple concrete things to look forward to in next year and especially the year after despite the coming recession the biggest factors for a long bear phase are imo rising oil prices and interest rates until the end of next year in addition to that revolving and non revolving credits are at an all time high while the savings rate of americans is at an all time low if the recession will last around months it should be a relatively sound timing for the price to shoot up to k per bitcoin during the third picture is metcalf's law which predicts the value to be minimum k by it's not as delicious as the other two models but still decent considering the fact that it would be the minimum value according to this model the value would be minimum m usd during and hover above m until it reaches during next decade these are just some thoughts things i've gathered hope someone finds it useful cheers ,catalysts for bitcoin ,1.0,1,zg8are,alexipoika123,0,2022-12-08 19:12:13,1670526747,1670526748,2022-12-08,19:12:13

bitcoin,hi everyone i tried out bisq and it was quite successful i made some buys made some sells and it seems like things work for the most part it has some bugs but nothing that does not eventually get resolved i had trouble figuring out robosats i'm letting you know my mistakes so that you don't make them it was probably because i don't know how to use the lightning network so well i tried using electrum with their trampolines here's how it went i got tor and figured out how to run it i went to the robosats website and found the tor link i went to the robosats site and i actually properly saved my bot i set up a small electrum trampoline channel for something small like btc i found a deal that i thought was reasonable and clicked on it i sent them my security deposit through a lightning invoice now i have three hours i then tried to set up a few different half sized btc channels that would not make the whole payment i didn't know that this was a problem i then learned through experience that the only way to pay the full invoice was to use a full sized channel that would cover the whole payment i made a new larger channel that would easily cover the whole payment i clicked pay for this lightning invoice three times and it failed three times each of those times the trampoline tried to send eight times i lost my security deposit i'm in the process of closing my lightning channels possible analysis electrum is not that good for lightning trampolines are not that good for transactions above btc i needed a way to practice these things and could not find one any thoughts on what else we can learn ,messing up at robosats,1.0,1,zfwugv,extrastone,0,2022-12-08 11:59:26,1670500776,1670500777,2022-12-08,11:59:26

bitcoin,as you might know the lightning network started back in march and serves as payment layer to scale the transaction speed of the bitcoin network and reduce the cost per transaction at the same time due to the lack of liquidity it was really hard to actually send payments at the beginning while it became easier to participate in the network there are still challenges to solve in order to make it accessible for the broader mass one of the main problems is the need to create an invoice each time you want to receive a payment from a ux perspective this is absolutely horrible lnurl and bolt try to solve some of these issues which i will try to explain in the following part lnurl what exactly is that lnurl is a stack of simple protocols for coordinating information needed to make payments over the lightning network using http the full list of lnurl protocol pieces can be found here but i'm just going to go into a few core uses that overlap with bolt the three core features of the lnurl protocol are defined as lnurl auth where a public key can be used to log in to a service lnurl pay where a wallet can ping a server through a static qr code and retrieve an invoice lnurl withdraw where a wallet can ping a server and request that the server pays an invoice provided by the walletfor using the authentication protocol the server provides a randomly generated number which the user's wallet signs with a newly generated key after the server retrieves the signed randomly generated number the key gets saved and can be used for future logins the invoice request functionality is a way to provide information to a user about a payment they wish to make in a format that is not an invoice this provides a description of the payment the minimum and maximum amount the service expects to be paid and a url for the wallet from which to request an actual invoice from here the wallet displays this information to the user allowing them to set a final amount and request an invoice after sending the invoice request and receiving one back from the server the wallet verifies that the amounts match what the user set and pays the invoice note this feature is already available if you're using phoenix wallet of satoshi or bluewallet muun does not support it as of now december the withdrawal request works by pinging the service and receiving in response a description a url to send an invoice to a random string and a minimum amount and maximum amount that can be withdrawn after filling in the appropriate value the wallet returns an invoice to the server and if it is valid and within the amount parameters the service pays the invoice the lnurl authenticate protocol can be used in addition to this to ensure that only the intended user can successfully withdraw using the lnurl link common use case would be if you want to withdraw your sats from a lightning service such as the lntipbot here on reddit or the lntxbot on telegram amp xb bolt why do we need it the term bolt is the acronym for b asis o f l ightning t echnology you can compare these to the bips bitcoin improvement proposals which are design documents for introducing features or information to bitcoin the bip as amended has since become the standard way of formally communicating ideas about potential bitcoin improvements as mentioned at the beginning of this post there are some ux flaws which need to be addressed to understand the problems bolt attempts to solve it is mandatory to have a look at the current standard which is used to create invoices bolt invoices generated by the bolt standard consist of three main components the destination where the payment is supposed to be sent to public key of the node the amount which is about to be transferred a hash which represents the payment secret the main problem of bolt invoices is that they can only be used once and therefore need to be created in realtime the creation of the invoice leads to the publishing of the payment secret and is therefore unsecure if you would create an invoice with the same secret someone could fraudulently request money due to the fact that the secret is known this makes the usage of qr code invoices for donations or other use cases impossible what is bolt bolt offers an attempt to achieve some of the core functionality that lnurl provides without requiring the use of a web server an offer encodes the data necessary to reach a node to request an invoice to make a payment either a node _id or a blinded path the last few hops in an onion route pre computed and encrypted to that node using onion messages it also can encode a minimum amount for a payment the currency being paid in an expiry time and minimum maximum quantity numbers for purchasing multiple items this is all of the information necessary to fetch an actual invoice from the node that issued the offer someone who wants to pay an invoice does so over onion messages one of the core features of bolt it allows nodes to make a direct end to end encrypted connection between each other that does not involve a lightning channel just like lightning payments these can be used to onion route messages after obtaining an offer a payer will use the information encoded in it to send an invoice _request message the creator of the offer will then respond back with an actual invoice there is also support for generating unique per user offers that allow the receiver to request a payment from the creator of the offer similar to lnurl's withdrawal request feature bolt invoices commit to a unique payer key this can be used in the case of issuing refunds to prove you are the person who actually paid the invoice this can also be used in combination with the withdrawal offer to guarantee that only the correct person can succeed in getting an invoice paid by the creator as opposed to whoever is able to get a copy of the offer what's best both lnurl and bolt enable a more user friendly way for paying or getting paid on the lightning network while lnurl sits on the application level bolt provides a solution on proctocol level where the new offers do neither require a web server tls certificates nor a domain and provide a higher level of protection than lnurl using blinded paths the bolt offers allow the confidentiality of the node id which additionally enriches the privacy it's important to say both solutions can exist simultaneously while online shops and other service providers operate a web server anyway lnurl is a good add on bolt mostly addresses the endusers and offers a more convenient way to interact with the lightning network ,what's lnurl and bolt ,1.0,1,zfw1ek,mcrech,0,2022-12-08 11:14:16,1670498073,1670498074,2022-12-08,11:14:16

bitcoin,hello everyone i am really loosing my mind on this i am actually not a technical noob but also not the very best technican but things like this should actually be very easy for me what i want to do i just want to connect my freshly set up sparrow wallet to my freshly set up bitcoin core first of all my setup bitcoin core on windows bit pc local network sparrow wallet on linux laptop same local network i've set up bitcoin core on my windows pc as usual and blocks are up to date these lines were added to the bitcoin conf file on my bitcoin core windows node rpcuser user rpcpassword password main rpcbind rpcbind rpcallowip rpcallowip where rpcbind is the local ip address of the bitcoin core node on windows rpcallowip is the local ip address of the laptop where sparrow wallet is running on the subnet mask is so should be fine i've set up a few things like firewall rules and so on i've pressed on test connection hundreds of times and it did not work at all somehow it suddenly worked and i got successfully connected to bitcoin core i was really happy but after closing the wallet and opening again it again won't connect at all again i am getting the following error message gt could not connect check if bitcoin core is running and the authentication details are correct see i noticed something really strange as well when i click test connection on the laptop in sparrow wallet even when sparrow wallet shows the above error the bitcoin core screen changes from you have no wallet loaded to a wallet that is named sparrow in bitcoin core and shows btc i did not set up any wallet on sparrow wallet yet i tried to do some research on this issue but it looks like i am alone with this and feel kinda stupid since i don't get what i am doing wrong i also tried disabling the windows firewall before connecting sparrow wallet to it without any success then i've randomly found this issue on github i've tried the following workaround stated on the github issue page shutting down bitcoin core on windows shutting down sparrow wallet on linux deleting a folder called sparrow in the bitcoin core directory starting up bitcoin core again starting up sparrow wallet again and tada it works it says connected to but only one time when i close bitcoin core or sparrow wallet again it won't connect afterwards it gives me the above mentioned error again but when i follow the workaround that i've stated above again it works again until i close bitcoin core or sparrow wallet and open it again so it only works for a while when i delete the sparrow folder in the bitcoin core directory but only until none of both applications get closed if i do so i have to re apply the stated workaround other strange things i've noticed when i do the workaround and are able to connect sparrow wallet to bitcoin core it does not show any inbound connection but sparrow wallet says connected to when i add disablewallet to bitcoin conf it does not even work with the mentioned workaround even if it should as far as my understanding is correct when entering wrong authentication credentials on purpose it takes some time until i get the error message could not connect when i enter them correctly it shows this error message instantly i got the feeling that it actually can connect since the time until the error message shows up is less than a second compared to when i enter credentials wrong which takes seconds until the error message shows up can anyone tell me what the actual heck is happening here that's one of the strangest thing i've ever seen in my year computer carreer sure i could just to this workaround every time but i feel kinda uncomfortable to connect create any wallet with this strange issue being present i should mention that a vpn software is running on both machines anyways it works when applying the workaround even with vpns on i've enabled the local connections options within both vpn guis but it also does not work without following the workaround when both vpn softwares are completely closed and shut down so the vpn can't be the cause of this issue i think i really appreciate any kind of help is there any possibility that this is a serious issue by sparrow wallet and not my fault at all thanks for any help in advance ,really strange issue when connecting sparrow wallet to bitcoin core,1.0,1,zfvw1i,exchange_rec,0,2022-12-08 11:05:54,1670497567,1670497567,2022-12-08,11:05:54

bitcoin,for those of you who don't know btc moves in a year cycle to where it rallies for years then falls for years or when it rallies it increases to appx x from the previous high and when it falls it drops appx of most recent high the main event tied to these giant upswings is an event called the halving where the free btc given to miners gets cut in half effectively reducing the inflation rate the pure definition of inflation increased supply of currency to where the rate of supply increase is cut in half and the demand stays the same resulting in parabolic rallies we only have a few more of these halvings left before there is no more btc to be mined so i would suggest that you strategically take advantage of this cycle while you still can i have taken full advantage of this beginning last halving by dumping my k into btc on the day it dropped to k and am stacking as much as i can while it's less than k good luck fellow crypto crew ,btc cycle explained ,1.0,1,zfhzmc,kanyewuzright,0,2022-12-07 23:34:35,1670456094,1670456094,2022-12-07,23:34:35

bitcoin,my humble opinion only feel free to disagree here they are level muun wallet mobile recommended for people that are starting out and don't have much knowledge about mnemonic seeds or how bitcoin works user experience is incredibly minimalistic almost idiot proof backup process is intuitive as well comes with lightning network integrated behind the scenes fully open source level green wallet mobile next level choice for those that are regularly stacking sats and have more understanding of how bitcoin works very modern ux and easy to understand has the ability to manage several wallets passphrases connect with tor connect to your own node link to hardware devices like trezor etc i personally feel comfortable having up to btc here but that's me your threshold might be btc or lower or it might be higher on chain only no lightning fully open source level bitbox bitcoin only edition hardware once you're ready for a hardware wallet and have more money this one is my favorite the people behind this wallet are very transparent and security conscious it's one of the very few wallets that protect against the covert nonce channel attack which is a huge plus for me the device is not difficult to use and the companion app is intuitive as well everything is fully open source the only thing that i don't like is that their default backup option is an sd card i prefer to discard the sd card and write the seed word instead level seedsigner hardware this is the best option in my opinion it is completely air gapped and uses generic hardware which drastically reduces the probability of a backdoor the only downside is that it's a diy do it yourself wallet you need to buy the parts and assemble it yourself not the ideal option for of people however if you're tech savvy and understand bitcoin this one is awesome fully open source level multisignature and air gapped laptops advanced this one is worth mentioning you will come across people that want to minimize trust as much as possible they will say hardware wallets are not secure enough and will point you towards yeticold com or glacierprotocol org this is probably the most secure option but it comes with a big tradeoff which is complexity consider this option only if you know what you're doing and have a lot of money you need to secure that's it hope you found this information helpful ps there are a couple of mobile wallets worth mentioning which are phoenix wallet and samourai wallet phoenix is a pure lightning network wallet and samourai is a privacy focused wallet both are great for what they do in my opinion worth checking them out ,for what it's worth these are the bitcoin wallets i recommend depending on your level of knowledge do whatever you want with this information ,1.0,1,zffjpb,humblebitcoinpleb,0,2022-12-07 22:05:05,1670450717,1670450718,2022-12-07,22:05:05

bitcoin,i've known bitcoin since its conception and been a part of this community since like everyone i wish i had gotten into bitcoin sooner this subreddit has helped me and many other people understand how the blockchain works how cryptographic encryption works what a cold wallet is and many more concepts that have made me love bitcoin now all of a sudden this is full of ideology and misleading concepts somehow crypto and blockchain are forbidden words what the hell does bitcoin not crypto mean it sounds just as ridiculous as web not internet or salmon not fish i understand the concept behind those sayings i'm a maxi myself but this circlejerk needs to stop or people will enter this world with the wrong concepts and don't get me started on cold wallets somehow now the only good option is removing the wifi card from an old computer and putting it in a faraday cage to pay some chewing gum with bitcoin i loved when this subreddit talked about the technology the new developments forks and ways to make people adopt and love bitcoin anything other than that is toxic and needs to stop or bitcoin will never be seen as the awesome tool it is i'm done ,i'm done with this subreddit,1.0,1,zf0d2z,epvup,0,2022-12-07 12:50:01,1670417412,1670417413,2022-12-07,12:50:01
bitcoin,i'm a bitcoin stacker and holder since no shitcoins i'm a firm believer that bitcoin will usher in a new era of monetary stability in the medium to long term future i lurk on this sub everyday and never post or comment but i dusted off this auto made account just to create this one post and then i'm gone again there has been a recent outpouring of hate toward some of the most popular hardware wallets eg ledger and trezor these seam to be perpetrated by a few very outspoken commenters but i'm concerned their narrow minded views could gain traction basically they posit that the only way to hold bitcoin is via an airgapped laptop or if you must a coldcard anything less than this is akin to shilling shitcoins because hw wallets like trezor and ledger allow shitcoin storage we need to be realistic here if we are talking about resetting the financial system then this means everyone will need to be able to use and store bitcoin safely are you really proposing that everyone who wants to store their bitcoin install open source linux figure out something like glacier protocol roll dice a thousand times and only use micro sd cards to store psbts like seriously not everyone is a cypherpunk what about people in the third world trying to outrun hyperinflation coldcards only come on y'all the size of your stack and the duration of your time preference will dictate your security measures if you are holding lt of your wealth in bitcoin i would think trezor or ledger would be fine that's how i started out when my stack was small as your stack grows and becomes a larger portion of your wealth you likely should upgrade your security measures i use a multi vendor geographically distributed multi sig solution now that bitcoin is a more substantial portion of my wealth i won't compromise on shitcoins it's bitcoin or bust but we do need to aggressively fight against this narrow minded point of view that coldcards or airgapped laptops are the only solution for storage cluttering up this sub with this viewpoint is going to freak out people new to the space ,recommending that the only way to use and hold bitcoin is via an airgapped laptop or via a narrow spectrum of hardware wallets is counter productive ,1.0,1,zf0b6z,realistic-jelly8133,0,2022-12-07 12:47:15,1670417255,1670417256,2022-12-07,12:47:15

bitcoin,hi all anyone here is a bit worried about the bitcoin security budget i am a bitcoin lover and i feel like it has the potential to change the world economy and society anyway recently i heard about the risk that could happen in the future about bitcoin stability it is an issue linked to the miners and their profit right now they get btc per block plus the transaction fee wich is something like btc next halving should not be a problem since it will be btc and so the halving after with a reward of btc miners right now can easily pay off the electricity and hardware to mine bitcoin and they will do it without any problems in the coming years with profit but what about in the next or years you would answer that the price of btc would be so high that even the smallest amount of satoshi could be enough for the miners to do their job but we dont know that for sure don't we plus bitcoin is influenced by the nasdaq and sp and by the government and central banks decisions and ultimately by the world economy and its stability imagine a period of a big recession statistically likely to happen in the next decades what happens if the price of btc drops below the minum price which will make miners stop doing their job since they get less and less btc every years that minimum price is going to raise i'm sorry for my english i'm italian btw i don't want to fud this thread i just want you to explain to me why i can stay relaxed and keep to stack satoshi ,bitcoin security budget,1.0,1,zeyg2a,dede81994,0,2022-12-07 11:06:19,1670411196,1670411196,2022-12-07,11:06:19

bitcoin,i've been a btc bull since and have been hodling since i've self studied markets for years and with all the different catalysts lining up have had a hard time understanding why the btc usd price has been artificially suppressed specifically with all of the macro events fundamental advances made the conclusion that i'm coming to is manufactured paper bitcoin i'm sure that most of you who read this understand that for every a bank takes in they can loan it out x this works for banks since there is confidence driven by education indoctrination mainstream media and lack of critical thinking a bank run on a large bank would completely destroy it as fast as ftx collapsed i believe this scenario is happening behind the scenes of a few other large current exchanges until you've redeemed your coins and control your keys the bitcoin that you think that you have in your account can be bought and sold to many other people simultaneously therefore the scarcity factor is invalidated the bad actors need to all be chewed up and spit out this is very good for the ecosystem i believe we will see a few more big exchanges fold before the end of the bear only the bad actors will fall due to poor risk management and overleveraging their balance sheet using paper bitcoin protect yourself against the purge and self custody as i would hate to see honest plebs impacted like the ones impacted by celsius ftx blockfi voyager etc aggressively removing coins from these exchanges is the only way to keep them honest thoughts ,bitcoin supply artificially inflated ,1.0,1,zefrnh,stackin_sats,0,2022-12-06 19:36:10,1670355387,1670355388,2022-12-06,19:36:10

bitcoin,hi guys i've been using coinbase pro for years now to buy btc like an idiot i've been ignoring the nag screens warning that pro is being obsoleted and that everything will be migrated over to a different product called advanced i figured when the time came the transition would be seamless i've gotta say though it's looking pretty ugly the pages on the new site flip back and forth randomly between light and dark mode none of my transactions appear except really old stuff back from when i first started accumulating but prior to my migration to pro spam on the sidebars shilling shitcoins credit cards and lending programs disturbing intermittent error messages along the lines of oops something just went wrong but don't worry your funds are safe links leading nowhere whereas pro was a really clean experience this new old site seems cheap and clunky i'm not terribly worried about it i never keep any btc or usd on the exchange except during the small amount of time needed to deposit place a buy order and execute an immediate withdrawal no funds are at risk that said the migration experience is been less than ideal has your pro migration experience been any smoother than mine i'm thinking this might be the motivation i need to switch to a different exchange i hear good things about kraken if you switched elsewhere due to the sunset of pro where'd you end up and is the grass greener over there thanks juan,thoughts on coinbase pro migration ,1.0,1,zedh2o,juan_more_bitcoin,0,2022-12-06 18:05:15,1670349933,1670349933,2022-12-06,18:05:15

bitcoin,i seem to remember every halving being approached with some trepidation as to how the miners would adapt historically price goes up and more hash power gets turned on can this happen another times in my simple understanding each halving will double the cost of production for most commodities the price will reach equilibrium near the cost or production assuming more halvings assuming a current cost of about per btc which i think is a low estimate this puts the bitcoin cost of production at x or over t per btc in this seems kind of absurd especially since it assumes the difficulty and hash rate stay constant to what they are today in given the trajectory of hash rate it should be safe to assume the difficulty will be much higher in than in this would mean the cost of production is even higher than t and the market price would need to be higher than t btc to support this that would put the market cap at m x t or quintillion again an absurd number as this is in t odays dollars inflation would make this even higher another possibility is that the hash rate reaches a maximum and then starts to drop off if the difficulty is too high miners will have to drop out of the race and reduce the difficulty and cost to be under the market price this would lead to centralization or at least a reduction in the number of entities controlling the mining hash rate i understand that at some point most of the block rewards will be in transaction fees but how does this impact the overall economics of cost of production the fees are currently running around of the block reward though when the network is busy it has spiked to from what i can tell the fees will stay relatively the same in absolute btc earned but the coinbase reward gets reduced with the halvings this seems like it would put a cap on cost of mining a block thats something like x what it is today so this would put cost of blocks around m and since that's for btc today that would cap it around m cap to btc more realistic but not sure the math holds up ,impact of more halvings,1.0,1,zcrzj9,arnzenarms,0,2022-12-05 01:02:54,1670202190,1670202191,2022-12-05,01:02:54

bitcoin,a possibly stupid question about mining incentive and how it relates to future network security if the following are true the overall strength of the network can be computed in dollar terms by determining the cost to acquire gt of the network hashrate the more costly it is to obtain network hashrate the more secure it is the network hashrate will be proportional roughly to the profitability of mining times some coefficient for how efficient the present day hardware is eg if btc per day are rewarded now then it's worth investing x per th s on mining equipment then in the future as block rewards approach zero won't it becoming increasingly less profitable to mine and thus won't network hashrate stall or dip and thus won't it becoming increasingly cheap to acquire gt network hashrate as an extreme example if the reward is only btc day mining hardware would become quite cheap and it'd be easy to buy half of the hashrate it seems that in the future as block rewards diminish in order for the network hashrate to be prohibitively expensive btc would need to have astronomically high prices or transaction fees would need to be astronomically high it seems as though through virtue of halving block rewards bitcoin is naturally pushed towards becoming a less secure over time or b exponentially expensive to use both of these tendencies would seem to perpetuate a death spiral in the utility a less secure less valuable and b expensive to transact less utility what am i missing as this relates to centralization of mining here's another aside seemingly bitmain could right now probably single handedly manufacture enough hashrate to own the network in relatively short order they are more incentivized to sell hardware for now however in the future when mining hardware is unable to be profitably sold because the block rewards are not valuable it seems as though their incentive could shift towards simply owning the network and cashing out ,as block rewards diminish how will the network be incentivized to remain secure ,1.0,1,zbvnzk,pennyether,0,2022-12-04 00:37:19,1670114253,1670114253,2022-12-04,00:37:19

bitcoin,i'm not sure how exactly i began down this bitcoin austrian economics rabbit hole but about a week ago it led me to two fantastic yet very distressing books the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard both written by saifedean ammous i'm kind of assuming that these books are well known amongst the bitcoin community i apologize if that's not actually the case the gist is basically fiat money trash bitcoin hard money good although it obviously goes into a lot more depth than that frankly i have felt very out of my depth reading these books and trying to think about economics this past week or so i am able to read the arguments presented and find them compelling and see the logic in them but i am left somewhat frazzled by them like i don't know what to make of them ammous does a good job of putting things simply for a bitcoin neophyte like myself but for some reason i still struggle to fully comprehend everything i find nothing wrong with ammous' core arguments and honestly i'm kind of alarmed by that is this everyone's response to reading these books what do mainstream economists who read them have to say about them for me to be like okay he's right and go about my life i have to think pretty much everyone in government is clueless which isn't that crazy i suppose but i still feel a need to seek out some sort of counterargument to these books before i make that conclusion anyways i've been looking with not much success for some sort of response from the mainstream pov to the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard preferably one presenting counterarguments to ammous' various points any suggestions ,best counterarguments available to the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard ,1.0,1,zbpija,blueball00ns,0,2022-12-03 20:17:29,1670098663,1670098664,2022-12-03,20:17:29

bitcoin,what we are beginning to see with energy production in places like kazakhstan and texas is using bitcoin mining as a sort of financial battery to store the value of produced energy digitally and then to use this value to trade between energy producers based on need this will make energy markets more efficient and make energy grids more resilient you can produce at below peak times and then buy at peak times with the bitcoin mined at other times you can produce a sellable asset with waste energy and energy resources to offset the cost of production this is fantastic but a less talked about subsequent effect of this that i possibly naively foresee is the increasing competition for energy by consumers vs bitcoin miners often the energy producers themselves a time will come if this continues when an energy producer will ask what's more profitable mining or selling the energy to consumers and when that happens the price of energy will begin to be dictated by the price of bitcoin how much you pay for electricity will be tightly correlated with how much bitcoin can be harvested with that energy and how much in fiat it can be sold for once this happens bitcoin then becomes a sort of de facto reserve currency for bitcoin markets the price of energy will become volatile as the price of bitcoin and it would make sense then to price energy directly in bitcoin bitcoin will become the unit of account in energy markets once this happens i expect bitcoin to grow out of just the energy industry as a unit of account over time and begin to be used as a unit of account for more and more markets since energy costs are so fundamental to the costs of most other things this phenomenon we are seeing now the use of bitcoin mining to extract value from waste energy will directly lead to bitcoin being used as a unit of account worldwide perhaps i'm missing something but i don't think so ,the use for bitcoin mining in stabilizing energy markets is very interesting,1.0,1,zboc1v,ur_mothers_keeper,0,2022-12-03 19:28:46,1670095738,1670095739,2022-12-03,19:28:46

bitcoin,hello i was wondering for a friend how to technically get cryptocurrencies circulating supply for the sake of simplicity for now i narrowed my focus on bitcoin bitcoin forked based altcoin the truth is the cryptocurrency node and it exposes the value i'm looking for over the rpc api command gettxoutsetinfo so the probably most naive way would be but perhaps the most reliable to run nodes of each bitcoin and bitcoin forked based altcoin and later on query each of them you would agree that it's horrible running a bitcoin node is good and good for health though as it cost proper set _up deployment maintenance bandwith hosting computing blabla then i remembered every i think node when initiating use a dns seeds gt the primary way to discover peers in the bitcoin network is to connect to a list of btc nodes that are previously connected however for the initial connection the node has to use a publicly known dns feed to retrieve a list of ip addresses of long running stable nodes so it's available in the code directly and it's easily scalable under master src chainparams cpp then searching for vseeds unfortunately as gettxoutsetinfo is computed by the node with indexed data from the blockchain sync it means it's also not available from the protocol perspective of course so having a list of a crypto nodes appart for a crawling job in my case looks like a dead end then i though maybe i can fetch each node address and hope one misconfigured or expose it's node rpc api publicly as it is not standart to have it enable by default does not seems realiable but i don't see another way i would be happy to hear any suggestion idea if you have ,how to get cryptocurrencies circulating supply from the source ,1.0,1,zbgfi0,omygrog,0,2022-12-03 13:34:21,1670074478,1670074479,2022-12-03,13:34:21

bitcoin,a friend of mine is a well known finance professor and advises the fed we hang out once a year for a few hours but never discussed bitcoin he has always thought it is trash worthless useless we hung out last week and he was interested this time in discussing bitcoin it didn't really get anywhere but i probably didn't do the best job in defending bitcoin the fact that he is a very prominent finance professor didn't make it easy today he sent me an opinion piece written by paul krugman that just came out yesterday which basically declares crypto to be dead yet again ths time i can gather my thoughts properly before responding but i thought i would share them here in case anyone has any comments on my response that could be helpful thank you for sending me this article i hate to parrot the same type of talking points that krugman hears but i do believe that krugman doesn't get it more to the point though no one has explained it to him because what is written in his article is mostly unrelated to what enthusiasts would talk about first forget about anything non bitcoin second and the main point inflation is generally speaking and in the last years a horrible thing if inflation comes about from positive economic activity then fine but if you sum up all of the inflation over the last years in the usa i am guessing it has been a huge negative on overall society this is a claim that i am making unverified by me if i am wrong about this then i am very misinformed and would gladly relinquish a lot of my support for bitcoin inflation is the main problem that bitcoin is trying to solve satoshi nakomoto probably said it best in as few words as possible the root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work the central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve we have to trust them with our privacy trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible satoshi's point above is about the debasing of fiat currencies his point is fractional reserve lending why is fractional reserve lending a problem seems to have worked all these years except that it hasn't and in the banks had to be bailed out with us taxpayers footing the bill in the short term and the long term you will notice that krugman's article states nothing about the above and that's why he doesn't get it this is what bitcoin is all about but the most natural follow up question is how does bitcoin solve the above problems why bitcoin why not rocks or seashells or stuffed animals that is another conversation qar,conversing with a fed advisor about bitcoin,1.0,1,zaykzp,qanonretard,0,2022-12-02 21:38:39,1670017130,1670017131,2022-12-02,21:38:39

bitcoin,dear all i quickly wanted to share with you one of my experience i made the last two days there are many people out there who are already sympathetic to bitcoin but are afraid or clueless of how to really use it in a practical way or even just how to buy invest they are afraid of the registration process involved at an exchange the creating of a non custodial wallet the money transfer from your bank to the exchange the trading buying process the on chain transaction and so and it would take some time sometimes days to walk them through all of that not even mentioning dexs so during the past days i found a way which helped already people to jump though the hoops in minutes i just tell them to show them an easy way how they can use bitcoin to buy at their local grocery store and usually people start to get excited that's what i do ask them to download the phoenix wallet write down the seed and keep it secret send me a ln invoice show qr code i send them sat from my ln node via the zeus appat this point people are already amazed how fast and easy everything was then i tell them download bitrefill check out all the stores there what do you like hey look there is one of our biggest grocery stores paypal me a small amount of money so that i can send you more satoshis and you can get yourself a gift card i send them more sats to their phoenix wallet via ln they enter the email address at bitrefill creat an ln invoice with my help at bitrefill and then they already transfer the sats to bitrefil within seconds with a little of help they discover that they get cashback in sats and get even more excited bitrefil sends the gift card within seconds to their email address they unseel the card and are shocked how easy this was during the last hours people who had nothing to do with lightning have now a first glimps of what is possible and have some necessary tools already installed on their smartphones of course i do not know whether or not they will now dive in deeper but it was an amazing experience for me and i believe also for them a different world is possible guys fix the money fix the world stack sats and stay save ,orange pilling amp onboarding a case report,1.0,1,zajf2w,futureisbright2031,0,2022-12-02 11:24:24,1669980280,1669991423,2022-12-02,11:24:24

bitcoin,im confused and no one has explained this in an understandable way as in margin call talk to me like im a labrador or a small child when i send bitcoin to another wallet it arrives in a minute or two i can then spend that bitcoin what happens in that one or two minutes before you answer there are several words that are often confused which is verify validate confirm and finalise first there is the ledger which is spread across thousands of computers like i myself run a copy on my old laptop but im not a miner is it these random computers the transaction immediately travels to that detect invalid transactions are we network nodes on the image it shows at secs the transaction is propagated and validated by the network nodes and this happens before the miners enter the process so the ledger computers have validated the transactions and these computers like mine must be the network nodes the next step it says miners include the transaction in the next block to be mined this looks like the first meeting between miners and transactions they havent validated anything at this stage next step says mining time if the transactions are already validated what does the mining do at this point the winning miner who solves the puzzle is rewarded with some bitcoin then it says the nodes my node on my laptop verify the result and propagate the block i dont understand what this means at the end it says new confirmations appear with each new block created i thought the private and public keys being the digital signatures would be the first level of verification or validation which one is the correct word when keys all match up and the transaction is sent and received isnt that a validation of sorts do the miners verify or validate transactions and if so when exactly do they confirm them at what stage is a transaction finalised if a transaction isnt finalised when i receive it how can it be ok to spend straight away are the miners called full nodes i am a node thru my old laptop to check on the miners they are following the rules so are the network nodes the ledgers the full nodes the miners and the nodes the verifiers of the miners thanku ,please explain the bitcoin transaction process ,1.0,1,za90pd,iamkingcliff,0,2022-12-02 02:50:21,1669949437,1669991344,2022-12-02,02:50:21

bitcoin,many people reject the idea of mass bitcoin adoption because they believe that the majority of the population is not going to be buying btc or they simply believe that most people are not tech savvy enough to do so what these people fail to understand is that mass adoption does not mean mass ownership during the gold standard most people owned little to no gold yet trough their currency they had adopted a gold based system and had indirect exposure to gold mass adoption does not mean everyone will have a wallet app on their phones and a hardware wallet at home it means that your pension fund will own bitcoin your insurance plan will have a allocation your workplace has a small just in case allocation on their balance sheet the purchase you do at eleven in your local currency will be settled using the lightning network instead of the old system from visa mastercard the app you use to send money to your friends to split the uber cost will be using lightning your local and state government will quietly own some too either directly or trough some financial vehicle like a trust or an etf most people will live their lives as normal but the services that make their world go around will be using magic internet money and they probably will not even know it the only clue will be that they are somehow better off financially than before the reason why all these services will adopt bitcoin is simple greed they will save money on every transaction and they will most likely outperform anyone who doesn't hold any sats ,mass adoption does not mean mass ownership ,1.0,19,z9iilv,v46ab0nd,2,2022-12-01 08:22:50,1669901200,1669991055,2022-12-01,08:22:50

bitcoin,working out a theory that bitcoin s rapid price declines and rises are actually good for adoption the rise is obvious it pulls people in but the rapid falls also keep a lot of people in because of the sunk cost fallacy and when prices start rising again they ve usually done a lot more research and have a different hodler mentality few admit it but most buy before doing much research at all they just chase green candles do you think bitcoin s extreme volatility even the downside has actually helped increase adoption curious if anyones done any thinking about this the huge bull markets aren t really the focus they obviously fuel adoption but has the rapid downside played a bigger role than people think ,does bitcoins rapid price drops actually increase adoption overtime ,0.74,9,z9dmys,anonymouscitizen2,27,2022-12-01 04:00:50,1669901864,1669991106,2022-12-01,04:00:50

bitcoin,first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win we are clearly in the fight you phase https the value of bitcoin peaked at usd in november before falling to usd by mid june since then the value has fluctuated around usd for bitcoin proponents the seeming stabilization signals a breather on the way to new heights more likely however it is an artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance and this was already foreseeable before ftx went bust and sent the bitcoin price to well below usd bitcoin is rarely used for legal transactionsbitcoin was created to overcome the existing monetary and financial system in the pseudonymous satoshi nakamoto published the concept since then bitcoin has been marketed as a global decentralised digital currency however bitcoin's conceptual design and technological shortcomings make it questionable as a means of payment real bitcoin transactions are cumbersome slow and expensive bitcoin has never been used to any significant extent for legal real world transactions in the mid s the hope that bitcoin's value would inevitably rise to ever new heights began to dominate the narrative but bitcoin is also not suitable as an investment it does not generate cash flow like real estate or dividends like equities cannot be used productively like commodities or provide social benefits like gold the market valuation of bitcoin is therefore based purely on speculation speculative bubbles rely on new money flowing in bitcoin has also repeatedly benefited from waves of new investors the manipulations by individual exchanges or stablecoin providers etc during the first waves are well documented but less so the stabilising factors after the supposed bursting of the bubble in spring big bitcoin investors have the strongest incentives to keep the euphoria going big bitcoin investors have the strongest incentives to keep the euphoria going at the end of isolated companies began to promote bitcoin at corporate expense some venture capital vc firms are also still investing heavily despite the ongoing crypto winter vc investments in the crypto and blockchain industry totalled usd billion as of mid july regulation can be misunderstood as approvallarge investors also fund lobbyists who push their case with lawmakers and regulators in the us alone the number of crypto lobbyists has almost tripled from in to in their names sometimes read like a who's who of us regulators but lobbying activities need a sounding board to have an impact indeed lawmakers have sometimes facilitated the influx of funds by supporting the supposed merits of bitcoin and offering regulation that gave the impression that crypto assets are just another asset class yet the risks of crypto assets are undisputed among regulators in july the financial stability board fsb called for crypto assets and markets to be subject to effective regulation and supervision commensurate with the risks they pose along the doctrine of same risk same regulation however legislation on crypto assets has sometimes been slow to ratify in recent years and implementation often lags behind moreover the different jurisdictions are not proceeding at the same pace and with the same ambition while the eu has agreed on a comprehensive regulatory package with the markets in crypto assets regulation mica congress and the federal authorities in the us have not yet been able to agree on coherent rules the belief that space must be given to innovation at all costs stubbornly persists the current regulation of cryptocurrencies is partly shaped by misconceptions the belief that space must be given to innovation at all costs stubbornly persists since bitcoin is based on a new technology dlt blockchain it would have a high transformation potential firstly these technologies have so far created limited value for society no matter how great the expectations for the future secondly the use of a promising technology is not a sufficient condition for an added value of a product based on it the supposed sanction of regulation has also tempted the conventional financial industry to make it easier for customers to access bitcoin this concerns asset managers and payment service providers as well as insurers and banks the entry of financial institutions suggests to small investors that investments in bitcoin are sound it s also worth noting that the bitcoin system is an unprecedented polluter first it consumes energy on the scale of entire economies bitcoin mining is estimated to consume electricity per year comparable to austria second it produces mountains of hardware waste one bitcoin transaction consumes hardware comparable to the hardware of two smartphones the entire

bitcoin,money is a measuring stick we use to determine the value of all things imagine you have a ruler where the distance between two ticks was constantly changing that is what is happening with fiat money as we attempt to measure the value of things in the world around us the standard we use to measure keeps changing fiat has no upper limit yet all things around us are very much finite this leads to a lot of guesswork in the measurements and things becoming very over under valued combine that with leverage credit and like a fulcrum with a long lever we can move something very heavy with a small amount of force then we have the valuations of things that find their way wildly off there should be in relation to everything else the system even encourages this because there is potential for huge profit while this occurs it will always come crashing back down though and someone is left holding the bag so what if we had a money with an actual upper limit that is essentially what the supply limit of million btc is an upper limit on how high we can value everything if we use bitcoin as a measuring stick the ticks on the ruler will remain constant valuations can be made with less guesswork and capital can be allocated more rationally m is actually a bit misleading because infinity in this case is finite it is the world around us and while the universe may seem infinite what we actually have access to is limited if we do not find a way to properly value the world around us within its limits we are going to consume it all like an over leveraged position we will overshoot the actual value of our world maybe we already have and it will all come crashing down on us in the future ,everything divided by million m ,1.0,1,z912x3,cats_n_porn,0,2022-11-30 19:44:27,1669837481,1669900577,2022-11-30,19:44:27

bitcoin,based on my understanding so far new to this so pardon me if this is obvious a big part of the hacking scamming prevention is the cost of energy ie it would require significant processing power energy which is very costly to maybe then make a gain that is potentially less than the cost of energy and also by succeeding bitcoin price falls and therefor the scammers hackers are in a lose lose situation by some predictions our world will eventually have free renewable energy i m trying to understand if free energy is therefor a threat to the anti hacking incentives built into the system as it would be basically free to generate all the processing power required to attempt to mess with the system s integrity what are your thoughts on this am i thinking about it wrong ,is free renewable energy a risk to bitcoin ,1.0,1,z7wk9y,t-p-formybunghole,0,2022-11-29 15:07:04,1669734441,1669817268,2022-11-29,15:07:04

bitcoin,the concept of a digital currency is a complicated one bitcoin is even more foreign of a concept for most the average person doesn't understand fractional reserve banking the average person thinks banks have vaults where they keep all of their customers money in cash hell the average person thinks cash pieces of paper has intrinsic value and that they own their homes this is not their fault the fiat debt slavery cartel shoves these lies down our throats essentially from birth the ftx collapse provides a beautiful example of the power of bitcoin to expose and destroy the corruption and farce that is the fiat financial system ftx collapsing is bitcoin working as intended it is the fate that awaits anyone that tries to counterfeit bitcoin i'm looking at you altcoins when fiat banks practice fractional reserve banking as ftx did and get caught with their pants down during a bank run they just print more fiat or get bailouts from taxpayers when they should go bankrupt while the message is accurate not your keys not your coins is too complicated for the average person in my opinion we should instead be promoting the use of specific self custodied hardware and software wallets for the people new to this space then it is a relatively simple concept to explain that any bitcoin that is not kept in such ways is in fact counterfeit , not your keys not your coins is not a good slogan for dummies fiat slaves,1.0,1,z7uckz,apprehensive-log-849,0,2022-11-29 13:39:08,1669729162,1669817285,2022-11-29,13:39:08

bitcoin,i read a lot of posts on the topic of exchanges taking your coin off exchanges and the overall movement and adoption of bitcoin we all want bitcoin to hit a million we all want it to become a global currency for many reasons for that to happen i believe we need big companies like coinbase binance crypto etc in order to get there hypothetically speaking if you meet a random person who knows nothing about any crypto in general yet they are interested enough to buy some coin and join the club you ll need to tell them how to do it if you tell that random person who knows nothing about this that they need to first buy coin then buy a cold storage wallet then transfer coin to said wallet in order to keep their coin from being used as equity by a major company they will in my opinion be very unlikely to buy bitcoin it s too many steps too much work for a newbie solution embrace major exchanges that provide an easy foot in the door this gets us to a million sooner every gme nerd thought direct registering their shares would send them to the moon yeah going real well for them when you meet someone new to crypto maybe just say yeah there are a few public companies with verified financials who you can easily purchase crypto through once you understand enough about it you can even move your crypto into a physical wallet that no one or banks can control in conclusion i believe we need major companies out there to get us to the moon embrace that and spread the word there is a difference between private companies and public companies ,opinion on the movement exchanges and wallets ,1.0,1,z6hv17,superavg,0,2022-11-28 00:38:28,1669595926,1669817720,2022-11-28,00:38:28

bitcoin,in a nutshell banks are a bit like ftx highly leveraged and can't sustain a bank run in many cases fortunately deposits are insured in the us the insured amount is up to k and the eu up to k prior the financial crisis of if banks were too big to fail the government taxpayers would save them but since the cost of doing so is becoming too big they introduced bail ins instead of bail outs bail ins mean that banks can take their customers deposits if they are insolvent basically they can legally do what sbf did to pay their bills the government won't step in anymore the bank will just steal your deposits to save them and no you won't get them back fortunately you are still protected up to the insured amount k but everything above can be taken from you now if we assume that there will be another financial banking crisis which is almost certain and if we assume the next crisis will be bigger than the last one which is also likely because that is what we have seen in the past it's just a question of time before some people are going to lose a lot of money in a bank that was supposed to be regulated trusted and safe https ,i think bail ins are another reason why bitcoin will become more popular over time if you don't know what bail ins are learn more about them and educate your friends and family ,1.0,1,z5yhvh,bitcorner22,0,2022-11-27 11:01:27,1669546922,1669817895,2022-11-27,11:01:27

bitcoin,there is an ongoing battle on bitcoin twitter about whether bitcoin should be considered a weapon and protected by the second amendment in the us or speech and protected by the first amendment in the us the legal precedent is that encryption is a munition in the united states and therefore protected by the second amendment during the crypto wars of the s cypherpunk adam back made a ridicule of this by creating a t shirt with an rsa encrypted message on the back making it illegal to export or show this shirt to non us citizen my thoughts bitcoin is speech i have no desire to see bitcoin adopted by governments especially the united states in the united states citizens are not allowed to possess the same weapons that the us government can possess as a monetary system miners would be a threat to the us if they were to get enough hashing power to commit a attack this could lead the us to classify mining as a weapon of mutual mass destruction and therefore after much propaganda they could take state control of the miners in order to protect us from china and russia or secure the network while i can understand an analogy of bitcoin being a protective weapon against fiat i see no purpose in getting legal precedence for this the government can twist things into incoherence they still classify tomatoes as a vegetable for tax purposes their legal opinions are irrelevant to reality what do you think is bitcoin a weapon or speech ,is bitcoin a weapon or speech ,1.0,1,z5v340,btcapsule,0,2022-11-27 07:44:10,1669535068,1669817920,2022-11-27,07:44:10

bitcoin,i promise this is not fud trying to have an honest discussion here and i use the term 'bad actors' very loosely here i just got done watching the latest 'what bitcoin did' podcast and part of it really stuck out in my head why is the btc hash rate at literal all time highs when price is so low and miners are reaching a point where they are not profitable there was mention of 'concern that maybe nation states are starting to turn on machines and mine at whatever it costs to get around sanctions' for example russia mining with their close to free natural gas so i started to think what if this was to actually happen there was some incentive either to simply just mine at a loss to get any amount of btc or to possibly attempt to attack the network could be for many reasons to flat out mine at a loss this would lead to honest mining companies turning off their machines because it was not profitable to run them different places pay different energy costs so obviously this would impact some countries more than others i assume maybe wrongly that the us would be the first to be non profitable should the hash rate continue to climb while btc price continues to fall i know at least i thought a lot of the design of bitcoin is based on game theory that miners will continue to join the network as adoption and price increases what happens to this game theory in this case when a 'bad actor' could possibly have close to free energy what would happen in this scenario when some entity is mining even if there is no financial incentive to do so would the network difficulty drop enough for 'honest' miners to keep mining to secure the network in this case i assume places like kazakhstan have very cheap energy that would allow honest miners there to continue to mine well after places like the us have turned off their miners how would this realistically play out ,possibility of 'bad actors' mining btc at a loss,1.0,1,z57dlb,twinchell,0,2022-11-26 13:18:40,1669468734,1669818133,2022-11-26,13:18:40

bitcoin,hey y'all long time lurker around these and other crypto related parts of reddit i figured this would be the best community to ask an honest question i have regarding self custody and its idealized future with the recent collapse of ftx the greater crypto community has been beating the drum of returning to the fundamentals and the importance of not your keys not your crypto i was listening to an interview on the breakdown with jesse powell of kraken this evening and he seemed to imply that the idea of keeping cash in a shoebox under your bed was some sort of perfect model for how people kept money in the past he was drawing the comparison to keeping cash under your bed in a shoebox in the old days and it felt like he was romanticizing it the implication is that keeping your crypto in cold storage on a hardware wallet is what everyone should be doing i do this i've done this since i understood the importance of it when i first got into crypto in early i know i'm a baby i wasn't affected at all by the collapse of ftx even though i'd purchased from them in the past self custody makes sense to me it's certainly one of the values i identify with and understand as important to the space simply put we don't want some centralized organizations able to freeze our assets control how we spend our money or in anyway affect our decisions surrounding it with all that being said here's my question if the idealized future of self custody is realized how does that look for the normal person and will it ever include the same conveniences assurances that large centralized banks offer the idea of keeping cash under my bed is frankly ridiculous there's so many things that can go wrong my house could be broken into and my shoebox taken i could lose the shoebox the shoebox could be taken by a family member if i ever want to spend that money i have to go home and physically get the cash to spend it somewhere the list goes on virtually all the same problems exist today with cryptocurrency but to some degree they're even worse want to spend some of my crypto i'd better have my physical hardware wallet on me or i'd at least better have transferred some of it to a location that i can access it from the internet what happens if my house burns down maybe i stored my seed phrase in another location but that's kind of a lot to ask isn't it what happens if my hardware wallet malfunctions what happens if the company that owns the hardware wallet pushes a bad firmware software update sure i can always restore that wallet with my seed phrase but holy shit what a painful process not to mention the learning curve on all of it is certainly non trivial i'm a software engineer a lot of the interactions intuitively makes some sense to me i won't get too much into how the expectation of asking some non technical year old person is fairly ridiculous i imagine a lot of that will be ironed out over the years as we find a more seamless way to set wallets up and interact with them i want my question to focus around is there a world where self custody is ever as convenient as trusting some centralized agency with a massive infrastructure and the motivation for people to spend money is convenience and to a certain degree security fraud protection insurance etc simply a trade off of having direct control over your money or does crypto have some long term solution for that i'm just too close minded to imagine will i always have to carry my hardware wallet around with me just curious to hear from others thanks ,a question around the future of self custody,1.0,1,z3b6ek,pgowdy13,0,2022-11-24 05:18:48,1669267138,1669818724,2022-11-24,05:18:48

bitcoin,i have a protocol oss that im thinking of making for public good i hope so i am trying to figure out interest lmk what you thinkmotivationa lot of people getting into crypto are concerned about losing their keys hardware wallet balancing losing your keys with them being easily found is a tough line to draw i m going to propose a protocol to securely back up your keys and i wanted opinions on it the goal is to accelerate crypto mass adoption by ensuring non crypto fanatics can trust that they wont chuck their life savings away on a piece of paper in a recycling bin requirementsi ve spent a while thinking about the necessary requirements of a good system and my proposal is centered around the following requirements so i d be appreciative of criticism of the requirements as they greatly affect the proposal security standards independent of any rd party obviously this has parts firstly you do not rely on a rd party to access said protocol secondly no rd party can access your keys under any reasonable circumstances for example an authenticator app could be hacked at least but realistically better than bank security so it should be more difficult for a hacker to access this than your bank account anonymous full anonymity preview zk proofs encryption open source all crucial code should be held within smart contracts that does not require front end software to functioni also came up with some practical requirements for this to work proofs must be timeless i e something as simple as your car registration plate is insufficient as this could change proofs must be easy there must be zero ambiguity in what you need to provide including details like formatting proofs must be accessible there must not be any doubt that the seeker should be able to recover their keys in an emergency proofs should be editable in case situations change contain redundancy in case some information is for whatever reason lost encodingencoding contains stages public id you enter pieces of publicly identifiable information pbid from the stage list and encrypt this using a symmetrical hashing algorithm in s creating c combinations of information each is stored in mapping along with a signed version of this information private identifiers you enter as many pieces of prid from the stage list and encode these in triplets using a symmetrical hashing algorithm next you encrypt this with decryption key d which must start with a hexadecimal representation of your public key and be characters additionally long you store this with your public key in mapping so each address corresponds to a list of encrypted data personal identifiers perid you can now create and answer and provide a hint to personal questions and encrypt these with d you then hash your private key mnemonic with d and hash the result with each combination of x answers you then store these in mapping as a list of hexadecimals decodingfirst you select pieces of pbid to hash and find the signed version from m you then recover your address using any zero knowledge algorithm to preserve anonymity and check if your wallet is of value before continuing you repeat the process with prid and recover d you repeat with perid and combine with d to recover your private key lists pubid name mothers maiden name phone number license email address account number sortcode priid passport number card number proof of email address the questions will be forever hidden so you can pick anything embarrassing that big corporations wouldn't know small points why do we need perids if only i can access prids realistically you will use rd party software to put prids onchain so we satisfy requirement why do we have prids given then above if perids work by themselves requirement you do not wanted jilted exes who may know some of your perids to get in why do we need zk instead of identifying people by their hashed pubids because you want to separate the process of knowing pubids and perids and having a public key could be inherently and independently useful also for this information to be updatable we must be able to use addresses to id the updater especially considering things in list may change,smart contract proposal,1.0,1,z2g15a,bm13131,0,2022-11-23 05:07:24,1669180056,1669819004,2022-11-23,05:07:24

bitcoin,hi all apologies for the long post but i'm just doing some thought experiments and this was one of them i don't have enough knowledge about the mining side of btc to go through with this but my question is pretty much the title and i'd like to see what others think and hopefully some reasonings on why this isn't an issue below are some assumptions behind the reasoning of this thought i understand the chances are incredibly low for all of these things happening but i'm still curious to know and i think it would be a good discussion i'm also aware of the difficulty adjustment per point but bear with me so i'm assuming btc price stays low suppressed miners get priced out due to unprofitability a lot and i mean a lot of miners stop mining within a short time horizon to prevent further losses i e multiple large mining pools stop mining so much so that there are far too many blocks until the next difficulty adjustment now there are a fraction of the miners left on the network tasked with solving blocks but the hash rate has been reduced heavily resulting in a disproportioned difficulty level to hash rate blocks are then solved incredibly slowly and require a heavy amount of energy input and cost to solve still resulting in a potential loss even if we assume miners would receive a higher subsidy said another way i'm assuming that although less miners would be entitled to more of the block rewards aka would make it more profitable for them this increase in rewards is offset by the large increase in cost to solve the block removing any additional profitability and keeping them in a loss positionthis then leads me to a few question what the title is asking is the mining difficulty adjustment calculation weighted more towards the near term and would it help solve this issue after slowly solving the remaining blocks well above the desired average minute blocktime i'd appreciate any good resources on learning about the difficulty adjustment can something like this be mitigated is it crucially important for the average block to be solved every minutes what happens if became one block per hour or worse than that i would think this is important as it helps preserve the security of the network and to keep the costs to attack the network high via double spending or making a longer manipulated chainthat's the extent of my thoughts and questions i'm no expert probably clear to some of you haha but wanted to ask anyway thanks ,can bitcoin fail or face a lot of difficulty if mining difficulty gets too high and miners get priced out due to unprofitability or some other cause ,1.0,1,z29jlz,sigsysigs,0,2022-11-23 00:01:09,1669161685,1669819074,2022-11-23,00:01:09

bitcoin,i've seen people say that bitcoin can never be priced at ridiculously high values such as mill per coin because that would make the market cap of bitcoin exceed the value of all money in the world however with more and more coins being lost then the higher the market cap can be if all million coins were mined and all but one coin is lost then that would leave that last coin left in circulation extremely valuable if that last coin is then valued at mill because that's all that's left then it would put the market cap at quadrillion dollars so we're put in a situation where the market cap of bitcoin surpasses all fiat money combined but only because the market cap is calculated on the million supply even if coins are lost forever ,isn't it plausible for bitcoin's market cap to exceed all value of fiat combined ,1.0,1,z227l2,expired_lizard_milk,0,2022-11-22 19:18:09,1669144703,1669819150,2022-11-22,19:18:09

bitcoin,as online merchants experiment with crypto and start accepting crypto payments they are often intrigued by the idea of accepting multiple cryptocurrencies but as time goes by most of them often realize that there is really no real benefit of doing so and the best crypto to accept is bitcoin it is the only crypto that has the most user base and the only one that is still standing today and will in the future even many crypto payment gateways for some reason also think it's lucrative to offer crypto options for their users but it's actually disadvantageous for online merchants who start accepting shitcoins on their webstores only to see their value drop or go to zero suddenly in the long run the safest bet is bitcoin whenever people ask me what's the best route to start accepting crypto my advice is always to start with bitcoin and take it from there and use gateways that are noncustodial and don't ask for kyc if privacy is a concern there are many payment gateways that make it simple for online merchants to start accepting bitcoin on their online stores and don't ask for id docs such as blockonomics gourl and btcpay server starting simple is always the best way and experimenting with too many altcoins especially without prior knowledge is risky ,with time most online merchants are realizing the benefits of accepting bitcoin in their online stores and dumping other altcoins ,1.0,1,z1t910,primalfabric,0,2022-11-22 13:11:46,1669122723,1669819249,2022-11-22,13:11:46

bitcoin,this is from the book market wizards jim rogers one of the best investors of all time is interviewed the basic problem in the world today is that america is consuming more than it is saving you need to do everything you can to encourage saving and investment eliminate taxation of savings the capital gains tax and dual taxation of dividends bring back the more attractive incentives for iras keoghs and ks at the same time you need to do everything you can to discourage consumption change our tax structure to utilize a value added tax which taxes consumption rather than saving and investing cut government spending dramatically and there are lots of ways of doing it without hurting the economy too badly we would have problems but the problems would not be nearly as bad as when they are forced on us if we don't bite the bullet then we are going to have a s type collapse with the present cast of jerks in washington it is not going to happen the politicians are going to foul things up they are not going to do what has to be done they are going to be more concerned about keeping their votes and winning the next election that is going to continue until we are forced into solving our problems then it is going to be a disaster initially the politicians will say we've got to bite the bullet and suffer through this this is good for us it will help clean out our system people are going to buy that for a while then it is going to start to hurt then it is really going to start to hurt at that point the politicians are going to give up and they are going to start to inflate their way out of it but the only way to inflate your way out at that point is to really print money the dollar could eventually become like the argentine peso remember the civil war expression i don't give a damn about a greenback dollar ,our leaders should encourage saving not consuming ,1.0,1,z1qnmv,mektzer,0,2022-11-22 10:56:34,1669114607,1669819275,2022-11-22,10:56:34

bitcoin,you may not see it now but sbf actually showed everyone what ftx was setup to do those involved felt ok doing it right out in the open because it's hard to imagine anyone would suspect what i am about to tell you if ftx was still operating to this day ftx was setup from the beginning as a dark money political slush fund this scheme always had an exit strategy but it was supposed to be years if not decades down the road before they would need to exit they knew there was always a chance someone would start to figure out what was going on but no one suspected this they were going to use ftx to fund everything they could to permanently take control of the us government over the next years think of the midterms as a trial run of this setup at sbf funneled million into the midterms making him the second largest democrat donator behind george soros it's very likely that m was ftxs customer funds or laundered money but it s safe to say at the very least it was not sbfs money the reason it seems like everyone is caught with pants down hoping if they hold still no one will notice is because they honestly don t know what to do they are exposed so badly that for now the safest thing to do is nothing sam knew from the beginning it was all fake and no matter how much success or fame he gained from ftx that his fate would ultimately end with the events we saw the other day i can only speculate on this part but i think as time went on he really believed that if it weren t for those who orchestrated everything that he would be a successful ceo of an exchange like ftx over time he started to believe his actions were why ftx was at the top of the world and he resented the fact he would never get credit for it resentment grew and he accelerated the process by taking actions he wasn t supposed to which led to the end of ftx to be clear i am saying the democrats and other powerful political entities set up ftx with the intention of using it to fund whatever they needed to expand their reach and stay in power they were going to continue operating as long as possible and they had a plan b that they saw as a win win the exit strategy all along was to blow up ftx in such a fashion that the sec would have what it needed to force regulation of the crypto space it would also help cover their tracks of their political operations the large media companies were also involved in running cover for this operation i m not sure how much they knew about what was really going on but i suspect they didn t know much they have operated essentially as a wing of the democrat party for years now and are likely comfortable doing this sort of thing without knowing why this is likely why they weren t worried about overselling smb and ftx to an absurd degree they likely wouldn t have been so obvious about it if they known what they were involved in covering up amp xb gt please note that some of the packaging includes parts small enough to be a choking hazard to anybody under the age of the first step in the assembly process is setting the cartridge labelled 'izyalikeit' to at least a value of centi marks ,i'm from the future here's what ftx actually was and what happened ,1.0,1,z1q359,osxwho,0,2022-11-22 10:21:02,1669112480,1669819280,2022-11-22,10:21:02

bitcoin,so i had a short debate with my programming teacher today because he says that bitcoin is a scam the main points that he brought up were that a a decentralized currency cannot be trusted because it can easily be used to scam the people who use it he used bernie madoff as a example when talking about scams amongst other examples such as ftx b bitcoin cannot be called used as a currency because of its volatility he made the claim that a currency must have a stable value c he repeatedly brought up the point that young people are stupid they don't know enough to see a scam coming direct quote d a point used against bitcoin was showing returns if you invested in november of until today you would've lost of your investment amp xb what points can i bring up to debate him on this tomorrow i'm trying to get points to defend bitcoin and show that a centralized fiat currency isn't as amazing as he is claiming it to be ,had a debate w my programming teacher looking for some points to bring up ,1.0,1,z1dpmm,blockingperson,0,2022-11-21 23:20:42,1669072858,1669819399,2022-11-21,23:20:42
bitcoin,i am saving money aka satoshi s for my daughter when she is an adult in years i keep her savings in cold storage safe and sound on the bitcoin blockchain where i never have to worry about it getting hyper inflated or frozen i was thinking about this today and i thought there are probably more people saving for their kids future by putting fiat into a bank probably x more than people saving it on the blockchain the sad reality of that is true people are saving their life savings in a bank we have a privilege to buy bitcoin right now it won t always be like that so i thought to myself imagine if i put k into a bank and let it sit there for years at best the purchasing power would have only gone down but most likely she might be able to buy a chocolate bar with it when she s an adult if i leave k in bitcoin for years she will never have to work a day in her life thoughts ,i m saving for my daughter when she s older but imagine this ,1.0,1,z1dp9i,independent_map6829,0,2022-11-21 23:20:16,1669072826,1669819399,2022-11-21,23:20:16

bitcoin,unless you have been living under a rock you've probably read some forbes or other paid promo article that vilified el salvador for making btc legal tender and holding or losing depending what article you read m in btc during the recent bear market decent just to be clear if you believe es is in bad shape from btc in any shape or form you've been duped by the banking elite and you should stop helping the elite taint btc through propaganda firstly of all el salvador gdp skyrocketed over annually to b recently after a massive influx of tourism and other monetary gains last year es has not sold any btc but let's just say for the sake of argument that they did and lost m outright all mil m is literally only of their gdp zero point zero two percent lol clearly this hypothetical loss would not affect the country in any way not to mention it is not true because es hasn't sold anything and hasn't taken any losses whatsoever before nayib bukele became president es had b stolen from its people from corruptions and was pretty much the murder capital of the world it was one of poorest and corrupt countries in exsistance where was the out cry for the people then where are the news articles about this bounce back from the low nowhere because there was no chips in the game for imf or other elite banking entities back then only now that its a poster child for btc let that sink in now violent crime is down revenue is up billions and the country's presidential approval rating is close to what's your presidents approval rating in your country eighty percent that's right ask someone who lives there if you don't believe the many many polls pretty ironic now that after all the murderous years of corruption and people suffering have turned into a huge approval from citizens that we have all these finacial experts calling this country to our attention to service their btc agenda and literal propaganda campaign it's ranked in financial risk globally number one that couldn't be more false and is really a blatant stat meant to do one thing vilify btc and the country that first adopted it btw these numbers are all public and accessible if you have any doubts so the next time someone tries to tell you btc caused harm in el salvador understand that propaganda works on people who are dumb enough to believe whatever makes them feel validated but this could not be further from the truth i don't support nayib and this isn't to call him a genius etc as much as it is just to point out other's stupidity that spreads these completely false rumors rumors that can literally be shot to pieces by using simple publicly accessible information research safely and mind the idiots who actually believe this shit also this post was removed from cc min after being posted because it made too many btc posts in the top ,if you think el salvador hurt its people at all by buying btc congrats elite propaganda works on you ,1.0,1,z1br1e,jerryleedog,0,2022-11-21 22:03:16,1669068210,1669819422,2022-11-21,22:03:16

bitcoin,for a hyperbitcoinized future to be viable everyone needs to be able to use lightning for the vast majority of their transactions and the chain for massive purchases if on chain is a vault and lightning is the wallet you walk around with easy transition between the two modes without sacrificing the interconnected nature of the ln is critical the loop feature that lightning labs has developed needs to be standardized and widely available to all or at least a variant of it i suspect that this vision of the future would have the bulk of on chain activity being loop processing one idea that i've been kicking around that i would like some feedback on is for lightning nodes to be able to both cooperatively close and open a lightning channel in a single transaction the two parties would essentially be refreshing the channel but more importantly one or both of them could have additional inputs to increase the size of the channel or additional outputs for moving off the channel this same functionality could allow a service provider that manages multiple nodes with well connected channels to have an arbitrary number of single signer inputs sign funds into the refreshed channel and then routed back to them a loop in and multiple outputs that come from lightning payments to be sent back out a loop out the overall size of the channel then would have a net change of the amount looped in vs out this should be possible to code without changing anything on chain merely an addition or change to the bolt specification to allow for this kind of refresh thoughts ,loop needs to be a standard on the lightning network,1.0,1,z1aecv,seeker0003,0,2022-11-21 21:11:52,1669065123,1669819435,2022-11-21,21:11:52

bitcoin,first of all i believe in the future of bitcoin and dca weekly as an investment however there seems to be huge weaknesses that i'd like to learn more about from this community to satisfy my naivete storage it's complicated don't hold your coins in an exchange not your keys not your coins etc if the goal is world adoption then i feel like the barrier of entry is pretty high for people to safely store coins they have to buy on a trusted exchange then transfer them to a hardware wallet where they are difficult to spend when the user is ready to many this process is confusing and expensive is there something i'm missing here loss of coins there will only ever be million coins however any user that is safely storing off an exchange risks total loss if they forget lose their keys that is a huge risk sure less coins in circulation may increase the value of those that remain but on a long enough timescale all could be potentially lost i suppose hiding cash in your mattress until your house burns down is a comparable example but that seems far less likely than losing your keys ,please address my perceived weaknesses of bitcoin,1.0,1,z18v31,psychedelic_dolphin,0,2022-11-21 20:11:36,1669061514,1669819449,2022-11-21,20:11:36

bitcoin,pretty well summarise my understanding of what the western public thinks about bitcoin i say western public because i spend a lot of time in asian countries and the general public acceptance and interest seems much more positive there i know this is echo chamber social media garbage and they say crypto and ftx not specifically bitcoin but we know they think the same thing and you know what i'm getting at here so my wondering is when i read posts and comments here on reddit about how bitcoin can help solve financial market problems and be a benefit for society and i remember seeing a video somewhere that talked about the launch of bitcoin being a watershed moment in history as the first time you can actually own your wealth so why are people still so anti bitcoin eg amp xb gt hopefully if the crypto market tanks hard enough we can turn off all the bullshit computers people are using amp xb gt it's destroying the planets and costing poor idiots their savings all while having the power to destabilize small economies not everything should be measured by how much money you can get out of it you have to look at the wider costs amp xb gt scarier is this will help bring about a central bank digital currency someone will be able to control all transactionsif there is really is a social benefit why don't people see it and why don't bitcoin experts do more to respond and rebut these general claims in social conversations ,general public attitude and awareness,1.0,1,yz3lrm,chacalau,0,2022-11-19 04:35:49,1668832567,1669820228,2022-11-19,04:35:49

ethereum,although i have high hopes for blockchain gaming there are certain evident problems that might limit widespread adoption and give the pe nft gaming industry more negative publicity i would add to the list some of these issues most people say that nft games are not fun i was one of them until i started checking out coinfantasy or gods unchained it's true that there have been a ton of game tokens and releases in the nft space recently and many of them look like garbage with very questionable gameplay it becomes tough to keep gamers engaged when the gameplay is extremely repetitive and there are less than minutes of it people just stop playing the game when they stop making money overall the majority of current pe games feel more like a job with the worst kind of grind would you agree how about a high entry barrier the majority of casual players simply cannot pay the admission cost it causes two related problems first the game is inaccessible to regular users which hinders long term user growth second investors are typically traders rather than gamers the developers receive little input when the investors don't actually play the game and the game gradually dies poor tokenomics is probably one of the common issues traders buy nfts and hire gamers scholars to play the game using these nfts scholars make money in the form of native crypto tokens investors and gamers dump the token on new investors however once new investors stop to join the game there is no exit liquidity for current investors we all know that traditional gamers hate nfts but i believe that one of the problems is that investors have unrealistic expectations despite the fact that there are many problems with this sort of gaming in general i believe that we should give it a try because there are many fantastic games what do you think about all of the problems i've mentioned will they soon be resolved that in my opinion is the crucial element that will allow games to advance even further ,what are the main problems pe games need to solve to become mainstream ,1.0,1,109c9sd,turtlepajama,0,2023-01-11 18:41:06,1673462476,1673462477,2023-01-11,18:41:06
ethereum,and from this i understand that a transaction between eoa_a and a smart contract can trigger transfers of token from the eoa_a that sent the transaction to another eoa_b but this transfer of token between eoa_a to eoa_b is not recorded on the blockchain my question now is if one is interested in tracking and be alerted by all activities on an account how will one do this for example if i want to be notified when tokens are transfered to eoa_b given the fact that the token transfer from eoa_a to eoa_b does not show up in any transaction how can i be notified based on my knowledge one way could be to listen to transfer events on smart contracts but follow up questions as far as i understand it is possible for a smart contract to implement the transfer methods without emitting the transfer event not good practice but nothing stopping this from happening which makes me think this approach of listening to the transfer event might not be fool proof the transfer method and transfer events are standardized part of erc token but i can imagine that there are other methods and operations peculiar to certain smart contracts not standardized but that will also lead to token transfer from one eoa to another so that means an approach of listening to just the transfer event will miss these kinds of token movement so again the question how can one track all events' especially token and eth transfers in and out of an eoa given the technical drawbacks i listed below are there some knowledge about the workings of ethereum that i do not know about that could make this possible ,how to track for certain all addresses affected by a transaction ,1.0,1,109816k,finlaydotweber,0,2023-01-11 15:54:16,1673452469,1673452470,2023-01-11,15:54:16

ethereum,one great thing about leaving your money in a bank is that you get interest usdc does not bear interest and eth and other cryptos are risky normal people may not always want to be invested into risky assets so it seems like they can hold dollars on chain which no risk like they can in the real world the difference is a few percent each year currently i can deposit money in bank who can buy bonds and give me interest most of the time this can equalise inflation admittedly not in if people have their money in defi then they arent making money some examples binance holds bn in stable coins which lose value over time robinhood has x dollars in a bank which gain value john sells ether and doesnt want to offramp capital gains fees etc its a bear market so hes scared to buy so he leaves his money in usdc which losesvalue mary sells aapl and leaves her money in a bank during a bear market which still yields in years people want to be able to accept payments whatever on the blockchain because new smart contracts come out that are more efficient cheaper faster they have no interest in investing it into risky assets due to lack of time and expertise they leave their money in usdc it loses value my sandwich man downt the road accepts my payment it goes to his bank account he makes yield my grandparents want to have their savings account on the blockchain except thats a stupid idea because it makes interest hence banks which make which is enough for him to live off of with mn in his account hence we need banks at some profound level you get the idea is this is a barrier to adoption what are the solutions to this ,interest bearing dollars on chain question about adoption,1.0,1,107hfss,bm13131,0,2023-01-09 15:39:24,1673278775,1673278775,2023-01-09,15:39:24

ethereum,here we get queries on this subject all the time so i thought i'd clear the air when you dispose of cryptocurrency to pay for a fee you may trigger a capital gain tax cgt event on the disposal value of the fee itself depending on your tax jurisdiction of course as a result this capital gain loss is realised on the difference between the acquisition and disposal price of the cryptocurrency before paying for the fee as an example you purchase eth to use for fees at the price of some time later you decide to mint an nft the gas fees for this mint are paid for in eth and you pay a gas fee of eth at the time of the sale the price of eth is now as a result you've actually made a gain on the eth itself which was used as a gas fee the reason why is because the acquisition value of the eth was and the disposal value of the eth is therefore this will trigger a capital gains event of for the sale of the eth which was used for gas while this may seem obvious to some you'd be surprised how many people forget to account for this in their capital gains calculations hope that clarifies things and feel free to read more on this here ,crypto taxes are eth gas fees taxable ,1.0,1,106ymuu,miker5659,0,2023-01-08 23:58:28,1673222327,1673222327,2023-01-08,23:58:28

ethereum,hi i have this particular use case and would like to share it so people can recommend any solution besides building the solution myself so here it is i want to keep some usdc or busd under a multi sign wallet which requires signatures to spend the funds of signatures but i can see a couple of issues with only having parties and needing signatures to perform anything with any funds in that multi sign first death second separation of the parties involved and a need to return funds to each party death if one of the two parties dies during the duration of this trust of funds the remaining party needs to go through and recover the other party's wallet to do anything with the funds which is an annoyance at best separation let's say any of the involved parties want to stop putting money into this trust fund again is that the name of this thing and leave with their corresponding share of the money but the other party doesn't want to sign anything which freezes the funds until the dispute is settled and worst case scenario none of the parties does what the other part asks and a judge gets involved to resolve the conflict then some solutions come to mind solving both particular edge cases at the same time involving a third party that plays the role of arbitrator it could be a lawyer who represents both parties but these cost money and you need to trust the lawyer to do the right thing to me what comes to mind is a smart contract is cheaper than a lawyer and you can write one if you know what you are doing to do the right thing but a smart contract can control of the funds and do whatever n of m signatures requests right i wonder if a smart contract can be a signer party in a multi sign wallet my reasoning for that is that the n of m smart contract signers control of the funds if someone smarter than the person writing the contract want to exploit a bug the attacker won't get anything of value because he still needs other signers to participate in the hack of the signers in this case okay so the question is there something like this out there in ethereum that can be used for cheap and with a frontend that won't banish suddenly or do i need to build it myself ,a piggy bank with stablecoins in ethereum using multi signature wallets ,1.0,1,zzlf83,shackra,0,2022-12-31 04:33:31,1672461226,1672461226,2022-12-31,04:33:31

ethereum,i have this question in my mind as i hear fear of eth being more centralized as one of the reason being few validators control majority of staked eth coinbase binance etc as ethereum network being merged to pos many long term hodlers are adding eth to stake them m staked i do notice that there is a strong need for being self validator rather in dec cen pools like lido coinbace etc and its not easy rather simple to become validator and stake with eth there fore i have a suggestion or proposal to bring it to ethereum devs try to bring a mobile mini hard drive device preconfigured and could be become single or multiple validator node's with extension to mobile app to control this device with the size of an iphone connects with wifi lan bluetooth usb charging etc reduce collateral limit from eth to eth or less this way more young investors will start there own validator nodes i am not sure if there is any device available but this would bring ethereum network security to be more decentralized this is my opinion and i wish this to happen soon if its not already there ,would there be a time when eth hold stake them self on simple to use device ,1.0,1,zyb6p2,prestigious_owl4418,0,2022-12-29 17:39:06,1672335560,1672335561,2022-12-29,17:39:06

ethereum,look i don't usually like to dunk on projects but status came out of the bull market with almost m in capital and frankly i'm shocked this team has failed to produce anything let alone a usable standard for ethereum based messaging that's safe everything on paper has pretty much said status should be a dominant messenger we had in the past year with covid multiple political turmoil that should have allowed status to become mainstream as an effective privacy tool a great bull run catalyst that could have captured more users an entire nft ecosystem that uses chat and token gating toolsyet in every case status completely fumbled with effective marketing and strategy to this day there's no incentive to run nodes no reason to use it as a wallet since its mostly clunky and doesn't natively support ls and even your top tier ethereum users just don't use it what is wrong with this team i feel like it's in a position to really get major use and be a great mainstream wallet yet teams like rainbow and even argent have captured more users i frankly think it's embarrassing that in our ecosystem we have to defer to horrifying alternatives for private chat like discord and telegram instead of using an eth native alternative yet here we are outsourcing to insecure options because status cannot even get a product out the door even after being given m whatever happened to adding this chat layer onto nodes to help boost adoption whatever happened to the update that was supposed to happen months ago whatever happened to the desktop client whatever happened to the team dogfooding the app and being responsive on status chat rooms who are now basically running all comms in discord at this point this team barely managed to even be present at their table at devconi'm sorry but i think there needs to be some serious public shaming right now to get this team to either reorganize and fire it's leads or at least do some amount of work to get a product out the door if ethereum wants to be more mainstream we should at least promote a secure web chat product that could be useful in places like hong kong and taiwan it seems like such a simple use case to get more adoption but absolutely nothing is being done nostr probably has more users at this point with a fraction of the funding ,looking at nostr and wondering why status has been a complete flop ,1.0,1,zy6dil,swap_catz,0,2022-12-29 14:13:35,1672323228,1672323229,2022-12-29,14:13:35

ethereum,have you heard about visa's most recent revelation that it is working to implement auto payments on ethereum through the development of a novel wallet type a procedure dubbed account abstraction by the company according to what i've heard visa did in fact issue a technical paper in which it looked into the idea of creating an automatic payment mechanism for ethereum self custodial wallets i find it amazing what we can all do with the help of modern technologies cryptocurrencies and other things in addition to the payment systems the ticketing industry and other things blockchain may also prevent the production of free clean energy i also think that the energy sector will use blockchain in the near future the amount of electricity needed to meet the world's energy needs as well as the effects of the global community on the climate and the cost of energy might be greatly reduced thanks to this cutting edge technology claims elan future enabling auto payments for self custodial wallets is difficult in light of the recent visa and eth news as doing so may require granting access to one's private keys to a smart contract that will be making the payments on their behalf in essence auto payments have the potential to jeopardize the security offered by self custody the process of confirming a transaction on the blockchain would apparently become more flexible as a result of all of this in my opinion visa for example believes it would permit multi owner accounts through multi sig and public accounts from which anybody may do business ,visa is looking at ways it can help the ethereum ecosystem develop,1.0,1,zwl0wc,combtimee,0,2022-12-27 17:31:58,1672162334,1672162335,2022-12-27,17:31:58

ethereum,i have been thinking a lot lately about key management and fund recovery it occurred to me that we could create a system that allows us to recover funds from lost keys by signing time bound transactions which can sweep our funds in the event that we lose access in a nutshell this works by signing a transaction that deploys a contract which sends funds to another address this could be a friend family member or even your exchange and setting time constraints such as not valid before and or not valid after you can also sign many of these transactions with multiple nonce values so that you still have a valid transaction in the event that you make future transactions since this signed transaction is constrained to the recipient and certain time criteria it is not sensitive and can be stored anywhere including on the cloud as a user you have the power to invalidate the transactions at anytime by either spending the funds or using up all the nonces i have started creating a prototype here let me know what you think of the concept and how you would improve it merry christmas ,idea how we could create timelocked transaction backups to recover ether from lost keys,1.0,1,zu2vvy,bitman321,0,2022-12-24 05:39:21,1671860376,1671860376,2022-12-24,05:39:21

ethereum,eof is the biggest upgrade in the evm's history coming in the shanghai fork in march eof will completely change how ethereum works here's a summary eip the first upgrade in eof changes how instructions to the evm are structured specifically it establishes a structure where one didn t really exist before it splits bytecode into two strings of characters one containing code and the other containing data this eip also makes it easier to upgrade the evm it creates a system to distinguish new contracts and what features each is using the evm executes each program based on the version of the evm it was released in so new upgrades can be delivered more easily eip this introduces the concept of code validation specifically when a smart contract is deployed contracts today aren t validated by the ethereum network before they re deployed they get validated as they re executed by people validating contracts upon deployment saves significantly on execution costs programs are validated once upon deployment and any necessary data for operation is made available in the data section of the bytecode eip quick tangent stack machines can be imagined as glass containers tall and thin they execute instructions and store data in these glass containers the first piece of data is placed at the bottom and everything afterwards gets placed on top in a stack stack machines have pointers that can move between pieces of data to read them the way ethereum shift its pointer today is with a jump which requires a destination or a jumpdest eip 's new opcodes enables the ethereum stack machine to shift its pointer far more efficiently this results in cheaper gas fees both for deploying a contract as well as for interacting with one it also makes on chain analysis easier eip this introduces functions that the stack itself can perform functions are instructions that need to be performed more than once in a program writing such instructions once as a function makes programs more efficient leading to cost savings on ethereum currently functions don t exist at the bytecode level that the stack machine executes on ethereum to repeat instructions the jump and jumpdest opcodes are instead used to shift the pointer to where an instruction is when it needs to be executed eip this eip focuses on validating contracts upon deployment but by looking for errors the stack machine might encounter called stack overflows or underflows stack overflow when a stack is out of space stack underflow retrieving data from an empty stackdespite stack overflows and underflows being basic errors they can occur on ethereum today the checks to prevent them are introduced with this eip amp xb eof is a suite of eips together making evm execution more efficient more consistent and more easily upgradeable eof itself is first upgrade in the evm's history and can be expected in the shanghai hard fork in march if you'd like to learn more read the full write up on my free newsletter below ,a simple explanation of eof evm object format,1.0,1,ztso6h,phillistine,0,2022-12-23 21:07:55,1671829689,1671829690,2022-12-23,21:07:55

ethereum,i wanted to share a thought i had about how putting stocks on the blockchain could help stock exchanges in less liquid markets attract investments and improve the lives of those in the region and the best part is it could all be done while encouraging transparency and giving liquidity providers a new way to invest in the stock market so what do i mean by less liquid markets these are stock exchanges in regions or countries where there isn't as much trading activity this can make it difficult for companies to raise the capital they need to grow and succeed and it can also make it hard for investors to find good opportunities but by putting stocks on the blockchain these exchanges can potentially attract more investment from around the world the transparency and security of the blockchain can make it easier for investors to feel confident about putting their money into these markets and for the companies listed on these exchanges it can provide a new source of funding and a way to tap into a global investor base but it's not just about attracting more investment by bringing more activity to these exchanges we can also help to improve the lives of those in the region when companies are able to raise the capital they need they can create jobs drive economic growth and contribute to the overall well being of the community and for automatic market maker liquidity providers this could be a fun and exciting new way to invest in the stock market instead of just being limited to the major exchanges they can now potentially access a whole new world of opportunities and help to drive liquidity in these less liquid markets ,putting stocks on the blockchain from less liquid exchanges,1.0,1,zqux41,godking99,0,2022-12-20 17:56:33,1671559007,1671559007,2022-12-20,17:56:33

ethereum,l protocols finally seem to be gaining traction which is good news for ethereum at this point it would seem plausible to conclude that ethereum has successfully used network effects and the first mover advantage in the field of smart contract technology and that it should now be trying to expand on this a stage that layer s can enable which one do you employ i'm used to metis a scaling solution that also seeks to enhance the dao idea by making it into something more serious through what it refers to as a dac the ethereum network which has the most developer activity and is the only cryptocurrency that is not obscure to those who are not active in crypto may continue to be at the center of web as it develops as a sign of ethereum's trustworthy reputation i'd say that eth is the only cryptocurrency except for bitcoin which can be seen as a somewhat conservative digital asset to own over the long run although ethereum is currently dominant and should remain so it would be wrong to claim that there is no potential for any rival layer s a direct competitor to ethereum that offers identical functionalities without the gas cost and scaling issues is referred to as alternative layer ,l protocols finally seem to be gaining traction,1.0,1,zppa5m,the_phallus_of_joy,0,2022-12-19 11:39:35,1671449991,1671449992,2022-12-19,11:39:35

ethereum,guys i usually get english but this time its all going over my head i know what finality means i know both finalisation and justification upgrades but the following did not make sense to me finality requires a two thirds agreement that a block is canonical an attacker cannot possibly create an alternative finalized chain without owning or manipulating two thirds of the total staked ether destroying at least one third of the total staked ether the first condition arises because two thirds of the staked ether is required to finalize a chain the second condition arises because if two thirds of the total stake has voted in favor of both forks then one third must have voted on both double voting is a slashing condition that would be maximally punished and one third of the total stake would be destroyed what i understood of total eth staked needs to be vote for upgradation of the concerned block the above alone and not even the reasoning or how this voting happens like if they ask for finalising justifying x block or is all of that done by only asking which chain is the correct latest blockchain state or what exactly is asked can someone please simplify this for me i do not understand anything from the second condition paragraph please explain me that paragraph in simple manner ,short passage to be explained like am ,1.0,1,zo6m4a,benbaldwinjg,0,2022-12-17 13:46:06,1671284780,1671284780,2022-12-17,13:46:06

ethereum,blockchains serve as excellent records of transactions blockchains are records but what makes changes to those records is known as a state machine a state machine updates the state of the blockchain from a previous to a new state bitcoin was the first widely used blockchain its state machine is responsible for very basic features essentially executing transactions between people it's very hard to do anything with bitcoin other than send or receive funds that's all the state machine can do ethereum was created to improve upon this model the key changes ethereum made were that the blockchain could store code amp the state machine could execute it ethereum s state machine is what we know as the evm amp can execute both transactions and custom code the ethereum virtual machine is capable of executing any program or algorithm given enough resources in computer science terms this means it is a turing complete machine any program can be built on this new operating system available to all censorable by none to better understand the evm we should quickly review what a transaction is on ethereum a transaction is a message with either funds data or both between people and programs people are known as externally owned accounts amp programs are called smart contracts transactions with smart contracts can include funds or data or both when funds are sent to a smart contract the smart contract can hold them or perform actions with them the types of actions performed by the smart contract depend on the data in the transaction to be more specific when a transaction is sent the evm looks at what it contains then executes the smart contract s code based on the data amp funds inside the result is recorded on the blockchain the blockchain is the record amp the evm is what causes changes to it amp xb i hope you enjoyed this write up on the evm this knowledge will be important for my upcoming write ups on eof transient storage verkle trees and many more subscribe to my newsletter to receive these write ups first and support me as a writer no ads shills or affiliations ,a simple explanation of the evm,1.0,1,zlybd6,phillistine,0,2022-12-14 18:23:42,1671042236,1671042237,2022-12-14,18:23:42

ethereum,why is a sizable number of people ignoring ethereum dexes in favor of cexes rumors about binance being insolvent are floating around ct and regardless of the fact that these rumors are probably just that rumors binance or any other centralized exchange should have never had this much power over the market binance is technically controlled by a single man cz meaning that one person has the power to make or break the crypto market this is far from what vitalik and satoshi planned for satoshi wanted to get rid of government control over monetary supply and vitalik wanted to create an ecosystem that will end up helping us self govern through defi and daos we already have dexs uniswap pancakeswap and there are ethereum based organizations like bitdao investing hundreds of millions of dollars into new dexs like apex so there s really no shortage of any sort of decentralized exchanges out there on the market the fact that we re being lazy and purposely relying on centralized exchanges is the problem this is exactly why exchanges like binance pose a huge threat for the market because in a scenario where it fails though unlikely the entire market could go down with itstart using dexes instead of cexes,these cexs only hold as much power as we give them ,1.0,1,zleo35,deliciousnectarine8,0,2022-12-14 02:20:18,1670984429,1670984430,2022-12-14,02:20:18

ethereum,myspace was one of the first massively successful social media websites many would consider it to be ahead of it's time as it reached widespread popularity before sites like twitter and facebook were invented moreover myspace found success well before social media became a cornerstone of the internet and web while myspace was successful ultimately it was the social media companies that emulated myspace's model that became the most influential profitable and dominant if the future of the internet is going to be defined by blockchain technology and decentralised apps perhaps ethereum won't be the champion of this architecture it was and still is ahead of it's time much like myspace was if the same pattern follows another project might come along emulate ethereum's success and surpass ethereum maybe ethereum is just too early and by the time there is demand for this technology something newer and shiner will have popped onto the scene to take it's place i really hope this won't be the case as i'm a huge fan of ethereum but this was just a thought i had today and i wonder if there's any validity to this argument ,ethereum as this generation's myspace what do you think about this analogy,1.0,1,zgn2vr,drfarts2,0,2022-12-09 04:41:26,1670560898,1670560899,2022-12-09,04:41:26

ethereum,ls have made major gains in the recent year and have developed new tech and upped their throughput ethereum as well has pushing into upgrading the chain in a way that boosts l throughput dank sharding towards the end of however regardless of how fast a chain l can process transactions there will always be the issue of dependencies amp xb what are dependencies dependencies are the result of blockchains and in extension ls processing transactions in a sequential manner dependency is when every transaction relies on the one before it in order for it to get executed this means that while a blockchain l might have great processing power all of that power is being focused on one transaction at a time regardless of how significant said transaction really is this put a massive restraint on the capabilities that a blockchain l is capable of performing think of it as you buying a new packaging machine for your factory this packaging machine has slots to handle multiple packages at the same time however your factory only has one conveyor belt meaning so you can technically work packages at a time but practically you re restrained by the sequential order you re forced to follow amp xb how are ls trying to solve this issue one way of solving this issue is implementing a parallel evm engine aptos labs developed a block stm engine and to make it short and uncomplicated for the average reader what this does is it executes a bunch of transactions in parallel it does that under the assumption that none of the transactions conflict one l polygon adopted a similar approach to their evm in order to scale ethereum but it came with its own set of complications because polygon processes a massive volume of transactions the system that aptos came up with won't work because in a hugely adopted system like the polygon pos acting as if there were no dependencies anywhere in any block won t work it would be taking a theoretical idea too farwhat polygon did instead was write transactions in a data structure called dag if you want you can expand your knowledge on this but in order to save time and not make things complicated what this does is take dependencies into consideration and then execute transactions before validating so that the metadata with deduced dependencies can be easily executed amp xb what does this mean for ethereum while there still aren t any parallel evm chains right now as we saw certain ls like polygon are working on developing one and hopefully this pushes other ls to follow suitthis is definitely an added value for ethereum in ethereum s new roadmap the chain will rely solely on ls for scalability so this will be major news considering that a development like this one will most likely double the throughput that any l is currently putting out all of which will benefit ethereum since its main issue has always been scalability restraints ,here s how ls are planning on moving from fast to even faster ,1.0,1,zejwnz,pihip2,0,2022-12-06 22:18:08,1670365103,1670365104,2022-12-06,22:18:08

ethereum,been researching and adding up my stake in xmr and bch but eth is catching my eye a bit more however the previous two coins are proof of work which i think i understand the pros and cons of well enough proof of stake on the other hand has me getting pretty mixed feedback and i'm not sure what to think as there appears to still be much uncertainty about the pros cons of pos vs pow from what i gather some thoughts are pros more energy efficient not inherently a bad thing to use a lot of energy but a lot of energy was mined in china which uses less clean sources such as coal or natgas faster lower time complexity and all that more scalable as less computation power is required that means it can run much more smoothly as eth is something of an investment rather than something backed by computation cons more beneficial to centralization and the rich by the model though i will note this arguably applies to pow as any oligarch who wanted to take over could pay someone with technical expertise to set up their own rigs and pay them a commission or something like that allowing potentially for censorship and coopting whether by force or by a attack less secure validators could be bribed more threatened by censorship than pow coins i for one think government has no role to play in the creation or regulation of money and that no man should have control over it in other words i support the separation of state and money for the good of the masses mixed neutral still has high gas fees use case is defi rather than outright cash though in theory perhaps it could be used for that as well bch is trying to get into defi as well from my understanding so perhaps eth could do something in the other direction amp xb is this correct are the cons overstated i know less about pos and eth defi in general than i do pow or the coins mentioned above all feedback appreciated ,how has the transition to pos gone so far ,1.0,1,ze4vr4,lordigorbogdanoff,0,2022-12-06 12:04:19,1670328270,1670328270,2022-12-06,12:04:19

ethereum,hey everyone i had an idea for a pp exchange like bisq for uk and eu but uses open banking ob to get around many of the shortcomings that bisq has i want to get feedback on this preamble recently you may or may not know that stripe released its own ramp in the us as has moonpay etc i ve used the moonpay one a few times to buy small amounts of eth for quick tests when i don t want to use my main wallet on a transaction i was charged and stripe also takes a ridiculous cut obviously its possible to go through cexs but its not easy to integrate a low fee ramp onto a defi website and from a cex and people dislike cex s for a variety of good reasons it s incredibly frustrating seeing large fees or complex processes to get tokens into my wallet from fiat bisq has two major flaws in my opinion besides the fact its in the us im from the uk which i would say is more forward facing on the fintech side there is little control over order sizes its not super liquid the payment methods are dodgy on the fiat side most importantly require proof of transaction which is difficulti propose an exchange that combines bisq s framework with open banking and some inspiration from uniswap that should allow virtually free pp trustless flexible ramping a seller puts their erc token in a liquidity pool smart contract and signs a hash with the block number which is communicated to the buyer a buyer enters the amount they wish to buy and the price is determined by an amm or gets the spot prices from uniswap binance an algorithm figures out everyone they need to pay and generates a qr to pay everyone you can bank transfer multiple people at the same time in the uk for free and instantly using ob called pisp the hash is in the reference hashed with the buyer address an algorithm scans the sellers data to look for the hash and once it is there uses the hash to unlock the contract using some zk proof and can generate the address from the signed hash of the seller or scans the buyers bank data to ensure the transaction has been made once the contract receives this proof it sends the buyer address the stored token this is the simple version i ve thought alot about the associated problems including being unable to verify account data etc to what extent does this rely on a centralized entity etc the conclusion i ve reached is that this should feels completely seamless for the buyer thanks to open banking i e scanning qr code i believe in interoperability not competition between good cefi innovations and defi it is completely non custodial at all stages there is actually no cost in this entire process except that of transferring the tokens to sell to a contract i think the concept of liquidity providers earning some fee like as on uniswap can fix potential liquidity problems grateful for any feedback ,idea for pp exchange that runs faster and more smoothly than a cex,1.0,1,zds8t7,bm13131,0,2022-12-06 02:25:07,1670293517,1670293518,2022-12-06,02:25:07
ethereum,what s happening is a clear indication why ethereum and its defi space as a whole is all we really need cexes have proven time and time again not only failed experiments but preempted scams people of lesser significance would have already been caught or at the very least put under house arrest sbf and caroline on the other hand are completely free he s doing interviews while she was spotted in nyc buying coffee yesterday the government is being extremely lax with these two and this get all the more emphasized knowing damn well that he was a major supporter financially to the current us administration its almost as if he knew all along that he ll need them eventually we gave these suckers the power they have and its about time we took them away dexes gt cexesit s always been and always should stay that way and no defi on ethereum isnt expensive anymore ls are a thing and there are many new ones being developed with major capabilities bitdao s mantle l is one example with hyperscalability capabilities you can easily use that or any other l to make a dex experience much cheaper there aren t any excuses this was a planned scam all along and this alone should convince us all to stop using these centralized exchanges and start using ethereum more ,the fact that sbf was one of the biggest financial supporters of the current us administration is a clear sign that he knew all along that he ll need them on his side dexes gt cexes,1.0,1,zdl62b,glittering_item_3818,0,2022-12-05 21:54:45,1670277301,1670277301,2022-12-05,21:54:45
ethereum,the nft market is down more than from its peak that means that many investors are holding on to worthless jpegs that they no longer want if you find yourself in this shitty situation there s a silver lining by selling your nft at a loss before the end of the year you can potentially save thousands of dollars on your taxes what s the point of selling my nft at a loss whenever you dispose of capital assets like nfts at a loss you can claim a capital loss on your tax return capital losses can be used to offset capital gains and up to of income for the year why do i have to sell my nfts before the end of the year if you want to offset your capital gains for the tax year you need to realize losses before the end of the year this is probably a good move if you took gains in january back when the market was hot what if nobody wants to buy my worthless nft if you can t find a buyer for your nft don t worry there are tools that can help for example the tax loss harvestooor is an open protocol that buys your worthless nfts for a minimal amount of eth so that you can claim a capital loss there are probably other tools like this too but this is the only one i ve tried for myself is there a limit to how much losses i can claim there s no limit to how much nft losses you can claim if you still have a net loss after you offset all of your capital gains and of income you can carry your loss forward into future tax years tl dr if you don t want them anymore sell off your worthless nfts and write off your capital gains ,psa selling your worthless nfts can help you save money on your taxes ,1.0,1,zdfhl6,actualfirefighter211,0,2022-12-05 18:43:14,1670265814,1670265815,2022-12-05,18:43:14

ethereum, what are sbts soulbound tokens are non transferable nfts that you can own but cannot give to anyone else the point is that we have a type of valuables in the world that can only be represented by a sbt a good example is a driver license you can get it you can own it you can show it as a proof but you can't give it to someone else you can read more about sbt role in the crypto industry here what are callistosbts callistosbt is a token standard for soulbound tokens erc features are too limited and it doesn't fit the role we want sbts to fill so we decided to build our own token standard from scratch and not to reuse the nft codes the source code can be found here key features that callistosbt standard provides data structures you can write data onto sbts permission management you can manage who can write what onto your sbts user defined content the owner of a sbt can write his data to his own sbt for example sbt can represent a security audit report recorded on chain security auditor can attach the report link to the token owner of the sbt can comment but cannot change the link that auditor assigned sbt may prove that the dapp address of a contract that it is assigned to is audited what is the purpose of this personalized sbt set callistosbt is still in development we want to offer users the opportunity to express their needs and expectations so that we could optimize the code this is like beta testing of the new token what is the purpose of participating you can help the industry growth by providing your input feedbacks you will have an opportunity to get your first sbt for free it is possible to tune the explorers wallets on chain services so that these could display sbts the sooner we will have a working prototype in use the better we believe that sbts may become a new buzzword in the crypto industry just like it was with icos defi nfts in the previous cycles what are the future use cases for sbts a link between identity and on chain address insurance on chain contracts security audit reports for dapps on chain digital documents that can be issued updated or revoked by the issuer digital documents that require a third party to sign verify it as notary companies ,we are launching a personalized souldbound tokens set available for acquisition by request ,1.0,1,z9rdw6,dexaran,0,2022-12-01 15:55:37,1669910151,1669991189,2022-12-01,15:55:37

ethereum,the entire reason cryptocurrencies were created to begin with because of centralized institutions like banks and governments taking control through financial means these centralized exchanges and other cefi platforms aren t any different they have full control over our hard earned funds and can legally do whatever they want with them this is not to mention that they re regulatory compliant meaning the government can basically tell them what to do how did it come this far ethereum and its dapps are a thing for a reason why use a centralized exchange when dexs are a thing especially when you take into consideration that they come with many more perks the defi is expensive arguments had long been dead with the advent of ls and other scaling solutions the ogs like arbitrum and optimism are there for a reason and now you got ethereum based organizations like bitdao investing hundreds of millions of dollars into scaling solutions which resulted in ls like mantle with hyperscalability features for dapps and web tech i d hate to see all of this r amp d money being wasted while we invest more into centralized exchanges why dont we take advantage of all of this tech and the fact that ls have become way more powerful and start investing in defi instead i m sick and tired of seeing people lose money because of the recklessness of centralized exchanges ,the fact that centralized platforms hold this much power in a space centered around decentralization is a problem this isn t what vitalik or satoshi envisioned ,0.89,69,z9id2e,deliciousnectarine8,18,2022-12-01 08:13:13,1669901223,1669991057,2022-12-01,08:13:13

ethereum,planning on building some opensource software smart contracts trying to see if my protocol is well thought through feel free to shit on itmotivationa lot of people getting into crypto are concerned about losing their keys hardware wallet balancing losing your keys with them being easily found is a tough line to draw i m going to propose a protocol to securely back up your keys and i wanted opinions on it the goal is to accelerate crypto mass adoption by ensuring non crypto fanatics can trust that they wont chuck their life savings away on a piece of paper in a recycling bin requirementsi ve spent a while thinking about the necessary requirements of a good system and my proposal is centered around the following requirements so i d be appreciative of criticism of the requirements as they greatly affect the proposal security standards independent of any rd party obviously this has parts firstly you do not rely on a rd party to access said protocol secondly no rd party can access your keys under any reasonable circumstances for example an authenticator app could be hacked at least but realistically better than bank security so it should be more difficult for a hacker to access this than your bank account anonymous full anonymity preview zk proofs encryption open source all crucial code should be held within smart contracts that does not require front end software to functioni also came up with some practical requirements for this to work proofs must be timeless i e something as simple as your car registration plate is insufficient as this could change proofs must be easy there must be zero ambiguity in what you need to provide including details like formatting proofs must be accessible there must not be any doubt that the seeker should be able to recover their keys in an emergency proofs should be editable in case situations change contain redundancy in case some information is for whatever reason lost must not be biometric not easy to prove not standardized means to measure it not easily always accessible lets say in years who knows if fingerprint id will be a thing encodingencoding contains stages public id you enter pieces of publicly identifiable information pbid from the stage list and encrypt this using a symmetrical hashing algorithm in s creating c combinations of information each is stored in mapping along with a signed version of this information private identifiers you enter as many pieces of prid from the stage list and encode these in triplets using a symmetrical hashing algorithm next you encrypt this with decryption key d which must start with a hexadecimal representation of your public key and be characters additionally long you store this with your public key in mapping so each address corresponds to a list of encrypted data personal identifiers perid you can now create and answer and provide a hint to personal questions and encrypt these with d you then hash your private key mnemonic with d and hash the result with each combination of x answers you then store these in mapping as a list of hexadecimals decodingfirst you select pieces of pbid to hash and find the signed version from m you then recover your address using any zero knowledge algorithm to preserve anonymity and check if your wallet is of value before continuing you repeat the process with prid and recover d you repeat with perid and combine with d to recover your private key lists pubid name mothers maiden name phone number license email address account number sortcode priid passport number card number proof of email address the questions will be forever hidden so you can pick anything embarrassing that big corporations wouldn't know small points why do we need perids if only i can access prids realistically you will use rd party software to put prids onchain so we satisfy requirement why do we have prids given then above if perids work by themselves requirement you do not wanted jilted exes who may know some of your perids to get in why do we need zk instead of identifying people by their hashed pubids because you want to separate the process of knowing pubids and perids and having a public key could be inherently and independently useful also for this information to be updatable we must be able to use addresses to id the updater especially considering things in list may change,smart contract proposal for backing up keys,1.0,1,z2g34j,bm13131,0,2022-11-23 05:10:14,1669180232,1669819003,2022-11-23,05:10:14

ethereum,what are your thoughts on having eth still staked on coinbase should i wrap it and sell it and then buy back into eth and move to my trezor the price difference to wrap and sell plus the fee would be about an automatic loss which i guess really isn't too big of a deal when looking at how far eth has fallen this year in the bear market still has held up reasonable well compared to the past should i just forget about the loss to do this and get off the exchange asap it's the only thing left on coinbase besides my little bit of algo which i'm about to move as well ,staked eth,1.0,1,z0ge6d,ritopl3s,0,2022-11-20 21:49:20,1668980978,1669819740,2022-11-20,21:49:20

ethereum,hear me out before burning me at the stake here there are many assumptions taken in this post os clients fallback clients etc and even more edge cases that refute my thoughts this post is intended to shed light on a general case that may apply to many validators if not most given it would seem to affect vanilla validator configurations amp xb validator uptime is a publicly discernable attribute through missed attestations and as anybody running a validator should know critical node maintenance like security updates oftentimes require a system restart that would result in publicly viewable downtime if i was a malicious actor that wanted to attempt to gain access to validator keys by compromising these nodes then this uptime metric could provide me a fast and easy short list of validators that likely have not gone through this maintenance effort i could even rank my list depending on how long the validator has been online targeting nodes that potentially have not been restarted in months or years with the assumption that security exploits are more effective on these nodes amp xb missing a few attestations is relatively painless from a financial perspective if a node operator is hellbent on not performing maintenance on their system for whatever reason would it make sense to pay a few cents each month and create a script that would cut network activity to the node for a few hours at the end of every month if it were me i think i would pay this low cost to avoid being placed on the malicious actors short list then again if it were me i would just update my node instead ,is validator uptime actually a vulnerability signal ,1.0,1,z086ku,pretentiouspickle,0,2022-11-20 16:21:18,1668961295,1669819833,2022-11-20,16:21:18

ethereum,prior to the merge update and the continuous reduction in issuance ethereum like any cryptocurrency network on the market was the unprofitable blockchain however things have changed it's important to note that a blockchain's profitability is not the same as a company's profitability in traditional finance technically subtracting new issuance from fee burns allows us to determine whether or not the network is profitable so as far as i can tell the blockchain's profitability benefits neither its holders nor new investors deflation on the other hand has the potential to be a significant speculative growth factor for cryptocurrency in the future however while the rallying ethereum will benefit investors and traders dapps users and developers will be forced to make transactions with higher fees and possible network congestion unfortunately during high network loads ethereum requires users to pay up to per network operation i remember at the beginning it was quite chaos dealing with transactions and gas fees i started using metis from the start and the discovery of l solutions was the greatest discovery for me as far as i can tell lol various foundations and projects however are constantly working on ethereum's scalability by offering new mechanisms for processing transactions or alternative layer networks that take some of the load off the main network offering higher throughput shorter processing times and low fees ,ethereum turns into first profitable blockchain from top of crypto market,1.0,1,yxtllm,rainmateriall,0,2022-11-17 15:47:42,1668700080,1669820703,2022-11-17,15:47:42

ethereum,i remember how vitalik once mentioned that the main goal behind ethereum is to help humanity and society become more self reliant and eventually escape the grasps of tyrannical figures and institutions and while this still might be far from happening it is the end goal that all of us as a community are working to eventually achieve it will take time but the goal is there if fact we re already seeing decentralized organizations helping out the people who need self governance the most many people living in certain african and asian countries are under the full control of corrupt tyrannical governments and institutions and thus ethereum and ethereum based decentralized projects can be the most effective there this is very evident by the fact that the mena region has registered the highest crypto market growth in plus there are some ethereum based organizations like bitdao that are funding subdaos like africadao to help boost adoption in african regions and give the people there a taste of well needed self governance this is all very revolutionary but again this movement is still in its infancy but it s progress nonetheless everything needs to start somewhere right all i really care about is seeing ethereum and all the projects and dapps built on it actually get utilized in the real world and not just that they re being utilized in a way that might end up improving the way of life for hundreds of millions of people eventually so i m all in for this hopefully i can witness this movement completely unfold in my lifetime ,ethereum based daos are helping boost adoption and utilize crypto in regions like africa and asia this is exactly what ethereum was created for,1.0,1,ywk8r4,glittering_item_3818,0,2022-11-16 04:56:18,1668574592,1669821158,2022-11-16,04:56:18

ethereum,i have a question tornado cashe was sanctioned by ofac however if you look at the etherscan from to does not appear but it is often indicated as rail railgun side says they are legal on their official website the reason is that if the nts requests the disclosure of transaction information you can submit the information in response so there is no problem this is where my curiosity arises the nts has obtained information that the colombian mafia uses railgun to launder funds however through etherscan alone it is not possible to know who the mafia is so when kim jong un heard that the nts was in a state of panic he was delighted he paid anyone in iran through railgun to buy the equipment needed to build a nuclear bomb kim jong un tipped putin and xi jinping off about his success then the pair too happily settled the arms import and export funds needed for the ukrainian war through railgun in this case the nts will come to a boil eventually the nts will require all railgun users to disclose txs' information doesn't this mean that the railgun's privacy protection is meaningless after all if you transfer coins through tornado cache and disclose all information to the nts there is practically no difference between these two methods right after all wouldn't railgun be subject to sanctions just like tornado cash ,is railgun legal ,1.0,1,yvu1t0,gotificial,0,2022-11-15 11:08:11,1668510507,1669821443,2022-11-15,11:08:11

ethereum,according to coinmarketcap the world now has nearly cryptocurrencies this makes determining which ones will be profitable in the long run difficult for investors but my personal favorite is ethereum which is also the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization there are numerous advantages such as nfts because ethereum is the major blockchain where most of the top known nonfungible tokens are launched people are excited about ethereum because the market for nfts is expected to reach more than billion in sales by with a percent annual growth rate this suggests that ethereum will be in high demand because it is required to pay fees when producing or purchasing tokens on decentralized platforms like opensea nfts can now be used to accomplish a wide range of tasks as we all know nfts offer some people the opportunity to make large sums of money however only some people who deal with them become a millionaire everyone is unique and everyone's risk reward tolerance varies as a result depending on one's perspective nfts can be viewed as either a lottery or an investment in some cases regarding nfts in lottery systems the lottery industry accounts for of global gambling revenue this type of gaming is rumored to be coming soon to platforms like billionair which is powered by a robust token based economy the airb utility token and nft based tickets these can be used to participate in raffles bet wager on and win the best skill and chance games like the crypto scene evolves so quickly there are more and more opportunities for ethereum and nft holders what is the most significant advantage of ethereum in your opinion ,what do you consider the biggest advantage of ethereum ,1.0,1,yud14k,the_phallus_of_joy,0,2022-11-13 20:25:43,1668371156,1669821987,2022-11-13,20:25:43

ethereum,did you ever think about how people decide on nft prices or how you price nfts i've been wondering how some nfts make money when they sell for as little as and people pay exorbitant fees that's why i've been thinking about this question markets for nfts began to gain traction in and by the end of march this new market for digital assets had a total lifetime traded volume of approximately million some of the frequently asked questions are how does one price their art and what is the best strategy for selling nfts despite the lack of predefined pricing strategies for nonfungible tokens nft sellers may choose to sell them at the listing price in a secondary market alternatively they may complete the sale at a price that a buyer is willing to pay referred to as the buyer price because of this gaming nfts are the easiest to deal with nfts can be rewarded with battle gameplay armor weapons or who knows what as in wam tournaments as you can see i'm more interested in gaming nfts so i'm not sure how pricing works for different types of nfts even so i believe that if you set your price too high you risk never being able to sell that item and that if you set your price too low gradually raising it will be more difficult what are your opinions ,i've been wondering how some nfts make money when they sell for as little as and people pay exorbitant fees,1.0,1,yubpt6,finley_dz,0,2022-11-13 19:41:30,1668368503,1669822002,2022-11-13,19:41:30

ethereum,do you think that most cryptocurrency games today lack the mechanics to keep players interested for even a short period of time i read one interesting article about this and made me think why haven t more top tier games introduced real world rewards into their games i'm referring to titles in which of gamers are not professional esports athletes and receive no monetary compensation for thousands of hours spent playing their favorite games the possibility of introducing monetary incentives has always been on the table why hasn't it been games need to avoid injecting monetary rewards into an experience that is designed to be intrinsically rewarding the gameplay should be most important because that's the thing that keeps players attracted to the game and entertained have you seen how awesome wam tournaments are well that's the exact reason i'm captivated by that game it's insane and we need more games that are fun and worth playing the fact is that nobody will invest hundreds of hours in an activity that isn't fun unless it pays a lot of money and you can only pay out a large sum of money if a large number of users collaborate to create a significant amount of value this quickly becomes a death spiral for nascent crypto games as the games are unable to generate enough value to adequately reward players for spending hours inside an unrewarding game loop instead of starting with economics or haphazardly adding crypto to a working game loop developers should create games that people want to play a play to earn mechanism could destroy the retention of even a fantastic game with high retention numbers what are your thoughts ,crypto gaming needs to be fun to be successful money doesn't matter do you agree ,1.0,1,ytdlz1,the_phallus_of_joy,0,2022-11-12 17:41:47,1668274922,1669822336,2022-11-12,17:41:47

ethereum, definitionthe blockchain is operated based on a plurality of nodes configured in a pp method countless transactions are submitted moment by moment from clients all over the world towards countless nodes spread all over the world the results of these transactions are recorded on all nodes and in particular the contents should be the same overall in order to realize this the rule that all nodes must follow is the consensus algorithm to describe it more conceptually it can be defined as a method in which a specific node is selected by a certain rule especially by the decentralization principle the selection and execution order of transactions is determined by the selected node and other good willed nodes independently verify and execute the contents of individual transactions and store them in their database as such consensus algorithms can be clearly defined however many people are misunderstanding this definition the subject of consensusthere is a serious misunderstanding about it of the general public misunderstands this point and most of the dapp programmers who have not built the mainnet themselves are misunderstood or ambiguous this is even shown on ethereum's official website there is no understanding of the definition of the consensus algorithm mentioned above or it is ambiguous the fundamental cause of this problem is the illusion about the subject of consensus in short even though the content of the transaction that's the authenticity of the author is not a subject of consensus it is often mistaken the only subjects of the consensus are the selection of transactions and the order in which they are implemented a the contents of the transaction exactly the authenticity of the author the transaction that a sends eth to b is electronically signed with a private key and deployed to the blockchain network the authenticity of the transaction creator is judged by each of all pp nodes it doesn't get help from anyone outside and it doesn't ask anyone outside however most ordinary people and surprisingly many dapp programmers mistake the authenticity of the content or the author's authenticity as the subject of consensus however this is not the subject of consensus but of anti consensus a famous pharase about this is the following do not trust verify as a result even if all other nodes in ethereum conspired to forge the transaction and store it in the database the honest node does not care about it at all and verifies the transaction by itself and stores it in its own database and new nodes joining afterwards will follow the honest node b selection and execution order of transactionsthese are the genuine subjects of consensus no more no less not all transactions submitted to the blockchain are selected and the selected transactions are not executed in the order in which they are submitted this is because it is theoretically impossible as long as the concept of a block of finite capacity is premised therefore there arises a problem of deciding how many transactions to accept in one block and in what order to execute them it is the problem of the consensus algorithm and in itself this becomes the definition of it i selection of transactionsfor example assuming that suddenly one billion transactions are pushed in one second it becomes impossible to put them in one block therefore we have no choice but to choose some of them in this case most mainnets collect transactions in the order of high gas prices and put them in blocks therefore even transactions submitted first in time may not be included in the block if the gas price is low they also run later than other transactions with high gas prices even if they are contained in blocks for reference the existing centralized system solves this problem by creating a queue so even if a billion transactions suddenly hit in a second it can theoretically accept and process the whole transactions ii order of execution of transactionsthis is also usually determined based on gas prices maybe all the mainnets are doing that and i've never heard of that exception in this case it is natural that the possibility of manipulation occurs the answers of existing blockchain protocols to this are as follows code is law it means that you are responsible for not checking the law in advance this is simply an irresponsible attitude for example if an incompetent legislator incorrectly entered the amount of parking fines and added another zero the legislator is not at fault and you are an idiot for not checking the law this is the current state of the blockchain in the dao crisis the law was eventually forced to be revised now it should be law is code the order of execution of transactions must be in the order in which they were submitted at least they should try to do that however the existing mainstream platforms insist that the current gas price auction system is the right way offering only poor excuses of course everyone knows that it is a lazism the birth of the block conceptas described above the current consensus algorithms have a fundamental problem nevertheless the reason satoshi and buterin adopted this method was to make centralized manipulation impossible in the selection and execution order of transactions that's they sacrificed the general principle of pre submissionism to pursue decentralization by the way in order to pursue decentralization in the satoshi sense the order of selection and execution of transactions must be determined by a node rather than a specific node however if countless clients submit their transactions to a myriad of nodes the unity of the overall database will be broken if the transactions are executed in the order submitted for each node therefore he was forced to seek ways to select and order transactions by any random node and to allow other nodes to accept them to this end it is needed to establish rules on who will make decisions on selection and who will follow them as selected by a duly elected selection decision maker other nodes follow it and execute each transaction and store it in their own database thereby maintaining the overall database uniformity it was the pow that satoshi came up with as a way to determine who has the authority to make the above selection decision that means that the person who solves the high level math problem the fastest will be given the right to decide on the selection of transactions however in order to do this you need time to solve math problems and during that period the transaction queue is accumulated at this point satoshi came up with the concept of the very block it is the miner who succeeds in solving the math problem satoshi established a rule that the miner selects all or some of the transactions accumulated during the period of solving mathematical problems puts them in one block and executes them and all other nodes follow the rules the block concept of blockchain was born in this context limitations of the meaning of decentralization in blockchainas such the block concept emerged as a methodical element to make it impossible to manipulate in the adoption and order of execution of transactions it was the best way within the limits of satoshi's intelligence the reason satoshi adopted the block concept was of course to achieve the idea of decentralization despite innumerable problems such as the execution delay of transactions during the block generation time the reversal of the transaction execution order and uncertainty of being selected in the block satoshi believed that decentralization would be guaranteed if a node was selected from among the innumerable good willed nodes spread around the world and those nodes determined the selection and execution order of transactions and he thought that if only the decentralization was guaranteed he could endure a number of problems caused by block generation if so it is necessary to calmly examine the advantages of the decentralization compared to the centralization system at the expense of such considerable costs for this it is good to make a comparison in other words it is assumed that there is one centralized node and that this node determines the selection and execution order of transactions and other nodes follow suit next the decentralization system is compared with this first there is no difference in the content of the transaction whether it is a centralization method or a decentralization method this is because forgery is impossible thus the transaction in which a transfers bitcoin to b works exactly the same on these two systems and is also stored in the database in the same way it is also impossible for the centralization system operator to produce the above manipulated transaction from the beginning and both systems are the same in this respect however there are differences between the two systems in the selection of transactions and in determining the order of execution the problem is that it is necessary to examine whether the difference is essential or relative speaking from the conclusion the difference is only a relative difference and in particular in terms of fairness that is prevention of manipulation it can be said that there is nothing better than a centralized system in a decentralized system let's look at this in detail the manager x of the centralized system can arbitrarily manipulate the selection and execution order of the first transaction in which a transfers bitcoin to b and the second transaction in which a transfers bitcoin to c so if x hates b loves c and a's current balance is bitcoin x can make the bitcoin which is normal to be transferred to b be transferred to c by manipulating the order of transactions or omitting the first transaction at all satoshi was aware of the above problems and as a countermeasure he studied how to empower random node operators to decide the selection and order of execution of transactions the result of the study was mining and the concept that arose as an inevitable result of the mining was the block finally at first it seemed that satoshi's idea could be realized without obstacles if there are innumerable nodes and an arbitrary or random node operator determines the selection and execution order of the transaction it can be admitted that virtually no one can manipulate it however the reality did not go as satoshi thought the first typical situation was the emergence of the mining king in china he was able to exert the power of the operator of a centralized node to some extent based on the enormous hash power and most of all the critical scene was the dao incident ethereum foundation and a series of sympathizers have artificially manipulated the selection and execution order of the transactions to generate an artificial fork since then countless artificial forks have been implemented in the blockchain ecosystem as a result satoshi's logic of decentralization has virtually collapsed as an inevitable result the block concept has now fallen into a relative rather than an absolute concept in the blockchain in fact even if it was not the chinese mining king or the dao crisis there was always a possibility of manipulation by arbitrary node operators that is the case when a node operator is preparing to manipulate at that time in case he succeeds in mining if he prepares manipulated codes and allows the codes to be executed when he succeeds in mining or is selected as a validator he can manipulate them for example with simple code manipulation it is possible to change the selection and order of execution of transactions in a low rather than high order of gas prices as such decentralization through mining and blocks was originally an incomplete method it was not a digital but an analog concept that is on a different level from the absolute concept of the impossibility of forgery by electronic signature and this result applies equally to pos whether the stake is large or small a node operator can manipulate the selection and execution order of transactions as long as he is selected as a validator but the problems don't end here it's time to ask a more fundamental question is it reasonable to fundamentally determine the selection and order of execution of transactions based on gas prices to say the conclusion in advance it is a manipulation in itself it's nothing more and nothing less than to benefit someone who has offered more bribes let's look at it in detail in general it is right to execute the transaction received first for example no matter how much remittance fees are offered to a bank it never changes the remittance order because it is a principle of nature to process remittances in chronological order there is no reason to treat this principle differently in blockchain therefore if the order is to be reversed a corresponding unavoidable reason must be presented satoshi's answer to this is as follows by extracting transactions in the order of higher gas prices the platform can prevent infinite repetitive attacks this is not a reasonable presentation this is a simple security issue and a topic unrelated to decentralization that's it is not an issue to be considered in the stage of building the core of the blockchain that should be considered once the essential structure of the blockchain is completed in other words in the core stage it is right to complete the basic structure so that the transactions are executed in chronological order therefore the infinite repetition attack problem should be considered in the process of considering various secondary problems of the basic structure that has been completed primarily in the process it is the right programming mindset to devise and install a new appropriate additional device separately also such a device is easily conceivable for example you can find a lot of great methods even at the level of common sense such as conducting transactions in chronological order receiving costs in terms of security rather than gas and returning them if there are no problems later unfortunately it is assumed that satoshi did not have time to come up with such an idea as a result the gas costs were forcibly inserted into the core part of the blockchain under the wrong name that's the security costs were inserted under the name of gas costs the aftereffects of satoshi's decision on subsequent blockchains were severe in conclusion satoshi's decentralized method could not achieve its original purpose the selection and execution order of transactions could be manipulated and more fundamentally determining them based on the gas prices is just manipulation in itself the gas cost priority policy is an unusual manipulation against the common sense that the transaction received first should be implemented first and the reason for that manipulation was also poor in conclusion it is inevitable to raise fundamental questions about satoshi's decentralization method that is the block method itself this is not just an issue for bitcoin but a problem for ethereum and all other blockchains disappearance of the blockif all transactions can continue from beginning to end without manipulation and the database can be stored equally on all nodes the purpose of the blockchain is achieved a curious result emerges here that is the fact that the concept of a block is not necessary to achieve that purpose in addition the fact that none of the existing blockchains achieved the essential purpose of the blockchains mentioned above perfectly at least satisfactorily makes us surprised that means that the block is a failed concept as shown by the comparison of the two systems above it cannot be guaranteed that the decentralized pp system of satoshi or ethereum has special advantages over the centralized pp system instead by adopting a centralized system but strengthening the devices that control the central main node to prevent abuse of authority it is possible to make a more fair and unmanipulatable system than the existing decentralized system for example a main node temporarily monopolizes the selection and execution of transactions and is forced to select and execute transactions in chronological order then the other nodes monitor it constantly and if it operates against principles disqualify it and appoint one of the other standby nodes as the main node in any case both centralized pp and decentralized pp cannot manipulate the contents of a transaction that's both methods already have solved the byzantine general problem the remaining issues are of what to select and how to set execution order but rather a centralized system can operate them more fairly the transaction submited first is executed first and the gas costs may not be received at last we come to a final conclusion the concept of the block is removed as long as the transactions are executed in the order submitted there is no reason to divide and put them in blocks this is no different from executing transactions in chronological order received by banks or credit card companies they no longer need the concept of blocks the concept of the block was only satoshi's desperate measure and it is by no means a logically necessary concept to achieve the purpose of the block chain and the most important fact is that it is desirable to remove the concept of a block as much as possible therefore it comes to the conclusion that the block concept will eventually disappear the only thing that remains is the transaction chain now the blockchain must be renamed the transaction chain which will revolutionize the blockchain ecosystem the appearance of nonblockchainat least it is possible to remove the concept of blocks while maintaining the current level of fairness of decentralization in bitcoin or ethereum more precisely it means that there are theoretically infinite ways to eliminate the concept of the block to improve the selection and execution order of transactions while securing fairness beyond the current level of the fairness of decentralization in bitcoin or ethereum then what will the consensus algorithm look like if the block concept is actually removed first of all the chain is made up of only transactions this transaction chain also has no fear of forgery at least in the content of the transaction as long as pp is the premise there is no fear of forgery or falsification of the contents of a transaction whether it is on a centralized or decentralized system if so the only thing left is the selection and order of transactions who will decide them this means going back to the point when satoshi created bitcoin based on experience over the past years satoshi has failed on this issue for now therefore we must return to satoshi's initial starting point even if we don't like that and we have to start over from scratch what needs to be observed here is one thing and that is enough that's the level of fairness must be above the current level of bitcoin or ethereum complete fairness is impossible it's not impossible in theory but it's practically impossible unless an innovative new technology like rsa emerges the easiest thing to think about is appointing a main node in appointing the main node the status may be endowed permanently or only temporarily the most appropriate answer will be somewhere in the middle of the two it is virtually impossible to appoint and replace the main node only temporarily i e only once for each transaction satoshi was confronted with this very problem at that time satoshi imagined the concept of block and from this blockchain was born and years later it was confirmed that the concept of block was a failure in this case the most common sense that can be thought of is to appoint a main node under a certain standard and constantly monitor it as a method you may use the platform's own code or you may use a smartcontract and if manipulation or laziness of the main node is detected a method of replacing the main node automatically or by poll is introduced even at this level the fairness is not inferior to the former chinese mining king or specific foundation led artificial fork creation above all this method has the advantage of being able to set the operating standards in advance in a smartcontract as a result arbitrary fork generation is fundamentally blocked this is because the fork generation principle itself that other nodes follow the longest blockchain has been removed then it can be said that it is relatively more fair than the existing decentralization system in the end that can be called proof of democracy pod decentralization which is less fair than pod is no longer decentralized eventually the religion of decentralization also collapses many people still believe in this myth it is superstition because there is no technical basis the trustlessness has a technical basis called a electronic signature however there is no such definite technique for the permissionlessness an essential element of decentralization as demonstrated above the block failed the decentralization has failed in both theoretical and practical ways therefore in this situation calling for decentralization is nothing more than calling for it as a simple ideology it is no more than a cry for th century anarchism decentralization without technical support is nothing more than a mere cry of ideology in reality pow and pos are also fundamentally operated under the control of pod they are no longer decentralized things let's look more specifically pow is not a mining certification method but a mining manipulation method as can be seen from china's mining king pos is also only a method that can be manipulated by stakeholders there is currently no technology or method to prevent the manipulations the dao crisis and the numerous forks that have been conveniently attempted since then only prove that the blockchain is accepting democracy its ultimate bastion that is it may be seen that the pow or pos is only a kind of pod at present in other words all existing consensus algorithms are pods pure decentralization independent of democracy does not currently exist therefore the method of selection and ordering of transactions can only be explored based on pod at present advantages of nonblockchain amp xb satoshi's block ended in failure however it has since become the standard for all blockchains most blockchains fundamentally do not deviate from satoshi's basic framework eventually all of them disappear or remain only for museum use personally bitcoin's block will survive forever on the other hand ethereum is very unstable there is absolutely no reason to maintain the block concept in the ethereum camp ethereum's attempt to maintain the current block concept is an obvious long term impossibility nonblockchain has many advantages once you can stick to the principle that is transactions may be executed in the order of reception or submission as in the previous example if the tree method with the main node as the top is applied transactions can be executed in the order received by the main node furthermore all transactions can be accepted without omission this is the same as the queue concept in a general computer os there is nothing special the nonblockchain would normally adopt a tree structure of course in preliminary the horizontal pp method of the current blockchain may be adopted as an auxiliary method it depends on the mainnet developer's choice anyway if the tree structure is adopted it can boast the fastest speed theoretically there can no longer be a rapid structure the nonblockchain does not require a concept such as gas price to determine eligibility to be included in a block because the concept of a block does not exist in the first place it is enough to accept and implement in fact the gas costs of existing blockchains are virtually irrelevant to the node's operating costs this is because the execution of transactions and the storage of data are performed in all nodes but the gas costs are only probabilistically paid to miners or validators to be exact gas costs should be distributed fairly to all nodes in this respect the existing gas cost system is extremely unreasonable instead it is desirable to institutionalize a separate method of payment of operating expenses newly and that is possible but that will not be specifically mentioned here the real purpose of existing blockchains collecting gas costs is not for operating expenses the mining rewards are sufficient to pay operating expenses in fact the real purpose of the gas costs was security costs this is being confessed by ethereum's official site in short gas fees help keep the ethereum network secure by requiring a fee for every computation executed on the network we prevent bad actors from spamming the network the nonblockchain collects security costs not gas costs if malicious intent is not positively recognized due to the review the collected gas costs will be returned in this way the security cost may be set high enough without resistance eventually by returning the gas costs they become zero as described above the advantages of the nonblockchain are considerable and there are no theoretical or practical obstacles to its adoption so of course the existing block concept must be discarded and a system consisting only of a pure transaction chain will inevitably emerge the nonblockchain consensus algorithm is bound to be pod for the time being for now we have no choice but to wait for the emergence of consensus algorithms that can achieve decentralization in the true sense by a genius who will appear someday until then it will only be in the form of a pod conclusionthe block was just satoshi's impromptu idea the necessity for hashes to be contiguous is only between transactions not between blocks as a result the name of the blockchain itself is meaningless the blockchain is only one method proposed by satoshi to realize the ideology of the transactionchain the block is not the truth the block concept was only one of the myriad ways to realize the transactionchain and it has now reached the point of disposal the byzantine general problem was not solved by satoshi but was just a problem that had already been solved by cryptography it was the electronic signature looking inside the blockchain at the current stage there are no particularly remarkable technologies other than the electronic signature other technologies are only those that have already existed or can be developed by ordinary programmers it is absurd to try to achieve decentralization with only such poor equipment in other words the crypto world at this stage does not have the ability to realize the ideals of blockchain as an inevitable result the consensus algorithm cannot go beyond pod this is the reality of today's blockchain but the spirit of commercialism wants to hide these limitations on the other hand glorify the block to this end they feature the emperor's new clothes the representative clothes are ethereum's future plans the complexity of this plan is indescribable the complexity was all caused by the concept of the block these are temporary complications that will all disappear when the block concept is removed or at least a fundamental platform that heals the problems appears for the time being of course they are successful in dazzling people ,the fictitiousness of the consensus algorithm the failure of decentralization and the emergence of nonblockchain the content is very long pre scrolling is recommended ,1.0,1,ysvaf0,gotificial,0,2022-11-12 03:25:57,1668223567,1669822513,2022-11-12,03:25:57
ethereum,it seems like the biggest takeaway after ftx has been revealed to be insolvent is that cold storage is the only way to go however i believe most people are overlooking the biggest potential concern that can be drawn from it there were giant centralized exchanges in cryptocurrency binance coinbase and ftx one of them is now on the brink of bankruptcy there is a huge danger in narrowing that list to two if a large percentage of people decide to sell after what s happened how can we know that coinbase and binance have enough liquidity to facilitate withdrawals one of the first things that happened during the great depression were mass attempts to withdraw cash from banks who did not have that cash on hand stable coins are not a solution if you can t sell them you can t spend them tether limited is not the federal reserve no matter how much usdt is minted they cannot create more usd out of thin air i m aware of tether limited s claims that usdt is backed but with the massive increases in price across the market that we ve seen over the past two years the reserves of cash in comparison to the rising prices has to be dwindling i m not trying to fear monger but people should be more concerned and should be demanding more transparency for centralized exchanges ledger or trezor wallets cannot be frozen but if centralized platforms don t have enough cash to pay out to those who want to sell then it completely undercuts any value proposition for cryptocurrency regardless of whatever the price is or how much your wallet is saying it s worth ,a lesson from ftx,1.0,1,yssdhq,kind-evening2778,0,2022-11-12 00:53:26,1668214419,1669822547,2022-11-12,00:53:26

ethereum,ethereum is a public ledger and by its design it s meant to be transparent however there is confusion about it being anonymous because many people still believe that the blockchain in general is anonymous which is false anything can be tracked on the ledger including the details of every transaction and deal you ve made since you started trading it may not be a big deal to some especially to those who don t understand that their personal privacy can easily be violated as a result of this people are starting to realize that there is a big privacy gap in crypto this has been amplified by the disturbing push for the adoption of cbdcs by the government which will give them some level of control over the finances of the general masses zero knowledge proofs have been cited by many to be revolutionary especially when it comes to building privacy tools zkps are encryption schemes in which a party who is a prover proves their case of truth concerning specific data on the other party a verifier without revealing the information here are few of the projects that have worked around the technology to build an important utility privacy in crypto aztec offers users privacy utilizing layer solutions specifically the zk rollups system users send transaction requests to aztec and the transactions are then put into a batch and rolled up with other users' transactions which can lead to a longer processing time but has privacy baked in at a base layer railgun is a privacy preserving smart contract wallet developed on ethereum and uses zk snarks to obfuscate transaction details and make anonymous transactions of any erc tokens or erc tokens users also get privacy at rest meaning they can keep a private balance which wasn t possible on previous l privacy protocols it works by removing all identifying information from transactions it s similar to a metamask or any other wallet just with privacy preserving zk snarks in place zether is a confidential transaction amounts are hidden and anonymous transaction sender and receiver are hidden payment mechanism on blockchains with an account model like ethereum it is implemented as a smart contract called zsc one of the major limitations that zether is known for is that transactions get processed at the end of a current epoch inferring that it can be quite difficult on a busy network however it is quite promising and has everything it takes to be among the major players in private crypto overtime i believe that there are many other ways to keep a private balance on ethereum as a privacy maxi i would love to hear this subreddit s thoughts on what s out there in this area a time will come when privacy will become a big word in crypto and we ll have the bulk of crypto users keeping their on chain activities private ,zero knowledge proofs application in ethereum,1.0,1,yra2jk,jacobsendy,0,2022-11-10 09:25:37,1668072348,1669823101,2022-11-10,09:25:37

ethereum,nft lottery is a new way of getting crypto assets for people and earnings for token holders nft lotteries operate similarly to traditional lotteries in that participants can buy tickets and wait for the lottery draws to start the prize winners will then be chosen randomly from a pool of numbers by the provider according to the number of matching numbers on their tickets i think this type of lottery began popular this year not so long ago it's evident because the nft has reached its peak and therefore everyone wants to get them literally in any way i didn't know much about it until i learned about this upcoming lottery project called billionair i started checking it out because i needed some type of refreshment and all games started to look the same this one attracted me probably because there's gonna be an nft based ticket to enable players to enter raffles as well as a comprehensive token based economy to allow players to bet wager and win in the best games of skill and chance usually the nft lottery has its own rules with different conditions as a rule to participate in the lottery you need a ticket it can be obtained by playing games participating in sweepstakes on social networks or simply purchasing would you play something like this to collect exciting rewards such as nfts and crypto ,have you heard of the nft lottery ,1.0,1,yqkcmx,finley_dz,0,2022-11-09 14:22:10,1668003742,1669823355,2022-11-09,14:22:10

ethereum,the debate over whether bitcoin or ethereum is a better investment continues to rage among communities this time it is being tested with microstrategy's crypto investments over the years we've all seen that microstrategy is currently losing money on the btc that it purchased over the years making it the public company with the largest bitcoin holdings what do you think would have happened if the company had invested in ethereum instead i truly believe that ethereum will soon outperform bitcoin even when we face high gas fees which i resolved with metis or low prices i always try to find a solution and remain patient because i truly believe that we will see the full glory of ethereum sooner or later it is no secret that ethereum has consistently outperformed bitcoin so it's not a stretch to say that microstrategy would be in a better position if it had invested in ethereum rather than bitcoin and the numbers back this up the comparison puts the various profitability levels of both digital assets over the year ethereum has continued to outperform bitcoin both in the long and short term it really begs the question of if bitcoin is really the best crypto asset to invest in what do you think of the ethereum future ,what do you think of the ethereum future ,1.0,1,ypxa9l,finley_dz,0,2022-11-08 20:18:51,1667938741,1669823581,2022-11-08,20:18:51

ethereum,guys i m working on creating a test dapp like a website using one of the various web ethereum providers and their api as my web project and i ve been doing only online reading from online platforms no actual tutor to break things down so it s kinda hard there s a lot of learning i ve done here on reddit and i hope it keeps being as informative to everyone for my test dapp i ve accumulated functions of relevant codes i d be needing but i d just like to know more about these particular functions and how they work guys what i really need to know is after signing a transaction does the spender who has already been granted access need to do anything else to initiate the transfer from the owner or does the transfer token function have to be in the same codes as the token approval one like before deploying your site like does the token move out after signing immediately or does the spender have to run any other back end code i know i m saying the same thing but i want someone who gets my actual question please and please i d be glad if any developers or web blockchain programmers can explain better basically for the transfer to happen is the transfer function is called after the message is signed been learning programming on my own and if anyone can shed more light i d be grateful about how the token approval allowance and transfer functions work and also to approve multiple tokens would it be one sign in message or multiple sign in messages for each token approval ,token approval function web apis website dapps codes needed and how to incorporate functions like query balances and approvals onclick,1.0,1,yovomo,even_manufacturer522,0,2022-11-07 18:27:51,1667845683,1669823975,2022-11-07,18:27:51

ethereum,ethereum is notorious for being prohibitively slow and costly at the height of cryptocurrency's most recent hype cycle something as simple as exchanging one token for another on the blockchain could have cost upwards of it's no surprise that l protocols have grown in popularity so there are layer rollups for those who want to keep their transactions within the ethereum ecosystem and there's a reason why metis and other l solutions have become so popular layer rollups have special systems in place to ensure that transactions aren't spoofed or altered before being sent back to ethereum's main chain which is pretty cool in what l protocol do you believe the most and what fascinates you about it did you know that the total value locked in ethereum's layer networks has surpassed billion ethereum's layer ecosystem is undeniably growing although the ethereum merge was the second most anticipated blockchain update this year ethereum supporters have long hoped that layer growth will help the ecosystem achieve mass adoption by lowering costs and making the network more accessible while ethereum mainnet continues to hold the majority of the crypto ecosystem's capital with just under billion locked up layer appears to be catching up quickly ,ethereum's layer ecosystem is undeniably growing,1.0,1,ymrerz,finley_dz,0,2022-11-05 11:32:25,1667647956,1669824737,2022-11-05,11:32:25

ethereum,while many ethereum supporters blindly celebrate meta instagram s move to launch nfts on polygon they have been tricked and ignore that polygon is no l and does not benefit ethereum in its current form polygon matic token has launched a vampire attack on gullible ethereum users investors by falsely labelling it as an layer solution and piggy backing off most of its infrastructure and hype associated with ls the marketing or better disinformation campaign of polygon was well done and convinced many ethereum investors that they are a l when the concept was very new while this move is brilliant it is also malicious unlike arbitrum or optimism polygon is in fact a side chain and therefore as much an l to ethereum as solana or other ls like avax are evm compatible chains the latter also tried to position as a spoon a friendly fork they barely burn a few s a day in eth gas fees eth in hours vs gt eth by uniswap alone polygon pos claims that the side chain architecture is temporary and that it will transition into a roll up e g polygon zkevm gt polygon hermez but this remains highly questionable and potentially is another false flag roll ups currently accrue little value and once they become big enough they likely try to create their own ls there is no incentive for them to do this move there is no such thing as symbiotic relationship between ethereum and polygon as of today and in fact they soak up its economic bandwidth revenue it is nothing but a big trojan horse and should be investigated very suspiciously by the ethereum community going forward ,polygon matic is not beneficial to ethereum and acts as a parasitic side chain soaking up its economic bandwidth ,1.0,1,yme67l,antana18,0,2022-11-04 23:43:06,1667605401,1669824855,2022-11-04,23:43:06
ethereum,i need an indexed ethereum transaction dataset for all accounts across ethereum for my research for that purpose i want to run an archive node along with an indexer such as blockscout that goes through the chain and indexes the transactions into an sql database and i'll be querying that database mostly using sql joins to get the data i need for different scenarios i would be building my own pc for running this combo archive node indexer so what would be an ideal hardware requirement for this build i went through a couple of articles on the internet and they all mostly deal with setups meant for mining or participating in pow where the transaction pools with broadcasted transactions must be accessed very fast in my case i will not be mining or participating in pow consensus i also do not care about getting the live transactions blocks into my system as soon as they appear so i don't think i would need very big ssds i might be wrong about this therefore it'd be great if ya'll can suggest some builds ,what're the system requirements for an archive node with an indexer for research without participation in pos verification ,1.0,1,ymb2os,surajsjain,0,2022-11-04 21:31:28,1667597501,1669824886,2022-11-04,21:31:28
ethereum,which is currently approx eth a considerable market discount why is it a mismatch of liquidity providers i see that large amounts of eth have been deposited to these dex while stablecoin tvl appears to have been dwindling or is it just a harbinger of the fact that large eth sellers are selling on smaller dexes and keeping the price artificially high on the large exchanges anyway its probably not going to be here for long right i picked up some cheap eth and will wait to see what the market does amp xb rupert b,certain dexes have eth priced up to cheaper than coinbase a profitable strategy longterm or just a weekend glitch ,1.0,1,ymaiq4,helpless_bullion,0,2022-11-04 21:09:13,1667596168,1669824892,2022-11-04,21:09:13
ethereum,hi guys i was wondering if any of you have seen a good valuation model for eth after the merge ideally it would be something that joins transaction fees and volume burned eth block rewards and the value of the native token altogether i m having trouble understanding how value mathematically accrues to eth holders through burnt fees or how to model something of that sort any help would be massive thanks in advance ,eth valuation post merge help needed,1.0,1,ym89x4,felipsb,0,2022-11-04 19:40:26,1667590837,1669824916,2022-11-04,19:40:26
ethereum,i need a dump of the entire state of every contract for a date in january i don't think it's possible to get this from infura or any of the other services i could run geth and create an archive node for that period of time ideally i could just import the old blockchain data instead of syncing anyone know a source for that data any other ideas for how to easily get all these contract states ,need the state of every contract at a point in ,1.0,1,ym23sc,jomby,0,2022-11-04 15:34:05,1667576057,1669824986,2022-11-04,15:34:05
ethereum,how can i see new eth supply issuance vs eth burned on each block i know of two sources and but i'm having trouble breaking this down specifically etherchain always shows the reward as greater than the amount burned u m just has gas in gwei and amount burned thanks ,eth issuance vs burn at block level,1.0,1,ym13qz,sf85dude,0,2022-11-04 14:53:23,1667573614,1669824997,2022-11-04,14:53:23

ethereum,it's really great news for eth that instagram is launching nft's on polygon as everyone knows polygon is great for ethereum because it publishes a state root to the eth chain every minutes and spends on gas i really hope we keep sharing polygon news here because it's great for ethereum matic is the token for polygon and eth is the token for ethereum matic is really great for ethereum and the ethereum ecosystem,instagram is launching nft's on polygon this is great for ethereum ,1.0,1,ylka7o,crypto_economist42,0,2022-11-04 00:50:20,1667523033,1669825156,2022-11-04,00:50:20

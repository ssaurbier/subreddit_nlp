Bitcoin,"Bitcoin swings every cycle and I realized a lot of money can be made by buying at the bottom and selling at the top.

Since Bitcoin's price is based on a network effects, hype can influence it a lot, and the fear-greed index is a good indicator of how much hype is priced into it.

I built a bot a few months ago that started with 10k, and each day it decides to buy or sell based on the fear-greed index. The idea is to buy when others are fearful of Bitcoin and sell when others are greedy, so do the opposite of everyone's behavior. The more fearful people are, the more it buys with the amount it has left to spend in USD and visa versa.

Everyday it sends me a text of what trade it made and what the total worth of the account is. The idea of the bot is to just allow me to stay connected with the daily price since we've been in another crypto winter, and to inform me when things are moving.

I thought I would share it with people, see if others find it to be useful, and get some feedback. I threw up a site where people can subscribe to it and get the daily text as well.

I'd be interested in some feedback and just to see if this helps other people.

Bitcoin,"I'm just wondering if it makes any sense I'll create a new seed and transfer BTC to the new wallet as I'm using same one for quite a long time now - I started with legacy address format.

I know that since then there were many updates to BTC, like segwit, native segwit, taproot and some of them brought also bits to encryption, like Schnorr signatures etc.

Was the encryption on legacy address format weaker than is today on native segwit/taproot?

If that's case, then it's probably not bad idea to create a new wallet?

Bitcoin,"My friend has been CRUSHING it at work. Last year he was averaging $6500 a month. He put in the work, he literally has been following the top guy every day/learning...and now he just made $11,500.  Then he got his paystub. Check this out:

After a 10% contribution to a 401k he made...wait for it...$7,000.  He did not understand how big taxes are. For all the people reading, if your income doubles, you are maybe making 70% more money if you stay frugal.  


He has a crazy cheap deal on his apartment in so cal for $2,000, his base car is $500, gas is $200, insurance is $150, utilities are $150. His basic expenses without food are $3,000. So he has 4,000 to eat, go out, live life. Oh yeah to invest also. I'm not saying he's poor/people should feel bad for him, I'm saying this:

For all the people hoping for a stock market/housing crash, I think you need to understand the amount of entitlements that have been promised to a growing and growing amount of old people. All these old people and the debt is going to literally crush us.

There is hope maybe in 15 years technology can help-maybe robots can actually get to the point where the cost is very little to get a lot -but until then, it's going to be printing. Literally taxes are high, debt is high, rates are low (historically). They are just going to print.

We are happy to announce the re-launch of [C-Leak](https://c-leak.com/) game, but this time with a simpler gameplay, smart challenges, and rewards in Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

For those not familiar with it, this is a web-browser game about cracking files leaked by a fictious hacktivist group called C-Leak. Those files are left available in a remotely accessible [Terminal](https://c-leak.com/terminal/). Your goal is to discover their passwords and decrypt those files.

&amp;#x200B;

The password discovering method varies from file to file. It can be solving riddles, puzzles, mathematical problems, lateral thinking; or image, videos, sound and other file data manipulation; or external accessible content; etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Every decrypted file reveals compromising data about unethical companies, people, and governments. Combining those sensitive info forms a narrative about that fraudulent entity, and with that you can understand more about their hidden truth (some are really mind-blowing).

Decrypting files will also reveal chunks of Bitcoin wallet private key and the first player to assemble them will have the chance to take as a reward for its amazing cleverness.

&amp;#x200B;

No account creation is required; play it directly in your web-browser. More than 1,000 (at the time of writing) in hidden Bitcoins and more to come in the future.

Bitcoin,"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a powerful and mysterious being known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi was said to possess great wisdom and knowledge of the workings of the economy, and had the power to create new ways of managing money.

One day, Satoshi decided to give a gift to humankind - a digital currency called Bitcoin. This currency was unlike anything the world had ever seen before, for it had a built-in mechanism called halving which ensures that the power of Bitcoin increases every few years.

The people of the land were overjoyed at this gift, for it meant that they could now trade and conduct business without the interference of powerful bankers. These bankers, who were known to practice the dark art of ""BRRR"" - a spell that could magically create money out of thin air and manipulate the economy - had long been trying to steal the people's time and energy.

But the bankers were not about to give up their power so easily. They saw Bitcoin as a threat to their control, and they set out to destroy it. They spread lies and rumors, and used their dark magic to manipulate the markets. But the people were not fooled, and they continued to use and believe in Bitcoin.

Satoshi, true to his nature, designed Bitcoin to be a magic that would help preserve people's time and energy by providing a secure and efficient way to conduct transactions. He believed that the power of Bitcoin was in the hands of the people and that it was up to them to protect and defend it.

From then on, the people of the land lived in peace and prosperity, using Bitcoin to preserve their time and energy. And Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin, became a legend - a mysterious being who had given the gift of economic freedom to humankind, and a tool to break the spell of BRRR.",The Magical Battle for Time and Energy,1.0,1,10azbxa,bitcoinuser2,0,2023-01-13 16:54:13,1673628871,1673628872,2023-01-13,16:54:13

Bitcoin,"Hi! I will write down few easy steps to new beginners with BTC here. I will not write why is BTC the best ‚Äúthing‚Äù in which you can invest right now in this strange econimic time because if you are here, you should probably know it! 

1. So, First of all. You must choose (unfortunately) some CEX to start buying your BTC. There are tons of them but try to start with verified like Binance,Coinbase,Kraken,KuCoin etc. My personal option is Kraken. Easy app for begginers for more than 10years here and without their own scamy token. There is also other ways to buy BTC without KYC ( Know Your Customer ) but this is not good for beginners because it is more difficult if you don‚Äôt have needed experiences.

2. On your CEX which you choose you can easily start DCAing ( Daily Cost Average ) into BTC. You can pay by deposit via bank transfer or with your credit card ( apple pay, google pay etc. ) Your balance will show in your exchange ‚Äúwallet‚Äù and here we are. The most important thing! Step.3

3. Buy Hardware Wallet. The best ones is Trezor or Ledger. It will cost you (depends on where you live) approximately 75-100‚Ç¨ but it is definitelly worth it. With this, you are your own bank, nobody else! Try to check some guides how to setup it. The most important is your seed. They are words that you cannot loose or store in electronic form. Just write it on paper and safely store it. 

4. Depends on your budget, after saving a certain amount of BTC in your exchange spot ballance, let‚Äôs say 0.001 BTC or 0.01 BTC you should transfer it dirrectly to your own wallet. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúwithdraw on external wallet‚Äù

Bitcoin,"So I'm not sure where to post this. its not 100% a bitcoin problem but falls under the ""running a node"" category. 

My setup was like this Debian11 on an OptiPlex &gt; core-gui &gt; Tor &gt; fulcrum &gt; mempool .space instance. It ran fine for a few months and I was stoked prolly the most stable node Ive built so far. 

But today I noticed that Core GUI crashed. No big deal I restarted, only 3 days behind whatever. I noticed that Core was having issues finding peers so I disabled Tor and restarted. Still cant find peers. Check my NIC. Seemed to be a NIC issue. So I restarted the PC.

This is when the real issues started. When booting Debain I got an error saying failed to start MariaDB and another error saying ""failed to start anonymization layer for TCP."" (I'm guessing this is Tor still not 100% on this) and the rest of the GUI failed to start. The odd bit was I could SSH into the PC and when I checked my systemctl fulcrum was still running and I could bring up my mempool instance (but Nginx was not serving it correctly so I got a 403 on my LAN whatever) 

So I guess my question is this. Do I nuke and pave? can this be recovered? Im leaning towards nuke and pave but if debain is going to shit out on me like this what OS should I use next? should I fully abandon GUI? I use Pop-OS as my daily driver and its amazing but I thought debain was supposed to be extremely stable hence me using it as a server. (I use debain a lot so this really confuses me) 

I guess im just at a loss here and hoping reddit will bless me with some direction to go in. I can boot into recovery so ill save all my CONF files but boy howdy am i getting sick of rebuilding a node every few months. also thank the tech gods i was not running LN or this would be x10 worse.

I wanted to share my experience using coinbase to trade crypto, so others won't fall into the same trap that I did. I started a coinbase account 3 months, ago, but ahdn't used it. Recently, I used it to sell about 10k worth of crypto that I was hoping to swing trade. Coinbase charged me $180 DOLLARS TO SELL OUT OF 10k WORTH OF CRYPTO! Then I decided to buy back into that same coin after waiting a bit, and coinbase charged me $150 to buy back in......... In other words, Coinbase charged me $330 for a sell/buy round trip of 10k worth of crypto..... I'm absolutely blown away and disgusted by their trading fees.

Bitcoin,"I have heard this a lot about BTC, ""BTC is a zero sum game"", which to me implies money can't be made by owning BTC.  My intention in writing this is not to discuss peoples motives for why they own BTC, and whether they are right or wrong. This zero sum nonsense keeps ringing in my ear.  Is BTC really a zero sum game? Well, yes in my opinion if we are discussing transactions in terms of BTC, its actually a slight net loss.  Every transaction requires some sort of network fee.  But on the other had in terms of dollars, it really depends...

If you assume the interest in BTC remains constant from this moment of time on, then holding BTC inherently increases in dollar value overtime.   If you assume no increase or decrease in BTC, then you're comparing a finite number with fiat, which the fed (for example) prints more and more of overtime.  By this train of thought, your x amount of BTC last year will be worth some amount more in fiat this year.  So in terms of dollars, its likely a net gain.

I don't claim to be a financial wizard, in fact I'm fine if this is completely idiotic.  But the argument of measuring something that that doesn't increase with something that does increase, points to BTC being a net gain, a ""store of value"".  If nothing else, meaning BTC gains no further adoption, I don't see how it doesn't serve the purpose of holding money printer accountable.  

Ok, ok, but there could be more crypto currencies.  I get this argument too.  Technically the number of crypto currencies could approach infinity, making BTC a net loss if interest was distributed amongst those other currencies.  That's fine, but I also don't see that as a threat.  I think there is inherent dominance in being the original... I can't really articulate that thought much further...

[The representative of El Salvador in the Miss Universe pageant, Alejandra Guajardo, has surprised with her choice for the ""typical costume"" that she used in the ""National Costume Show"" of the contest.](https://gyazo.com/161ecb6d9a11da1a746e5569f7e1419d)

Guajardo has given something to talk about by wearing a suit that pays tribute to Bitcoin, which became the official currency of El Salvador in 2021. Miss El Salvador wanted to show the world the evolution of the currency in the country.


The suit that Guajardo has worn was designed by the Salvadoran Francisco Guerrero, and, as he has described, tries to show the evolution of the currency in the history of El Salvador.

From cocoa, through the colon and the dollar to Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that was adopted for use in the country.


To make the suit, the Salvadoran designer has used materials such as cardboard, leatherette, leather, rhinestones, cloth, and iron. The predominant colors of gold, silver and bronze represent the ‚Äúmain colors of the coin‚Äù.


reactions
Immediately, Alejandra Guajardo's suit has caused a huge amount of reactions on social networks. There are those who have claimed to be disappointed by the Miss El Salvador outfit.

Others, on the other hand, have highlighted the participation of Guajardo and his ""tribute"" to Bitcoin and other currencies in the history of El Salvador.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin represents different things for everyone. But in such a polarized world I find refreshing that people can stand side by side for something that they believe (even though their reason to believe it is different). Some people here for having the option to keep their savings out of the hand of any institution, some just believe the number will rise, some actually think this will free people and provide everyone a better future. A good thing about Bitcoin that it aligns incentives and since the incentives are all aligned, even if someone here for the altruistic reasons or selfish reasons, it doesn‚Äôt really matter. And that‚Äôs a good thing and I feel hope ‚Äúreal hope for the future‚Äù maybe for the first time of my life that we can still unite and build something together, slowly but surely. 

I have difficult time to understand why people care about it so much and feel the need to talk badly about it if they believe it will go to zero dollars. I don‚Äôt understand the hate or frustration behind it. As a counter argument one can say the Bitcoiners show a similar attitude towards shitcoins. But I think the real frustration there is not related to the pricing of other coins. The frustration is there because Bitcoin represented and understood by lots of people under the umbrella of cryptocurrencies and the scammers using their fabricated and controlled currencies is damaging to what Bitcoin is trying to achieve.

This is a long road and I myself still very new to this ecosystem. And when you think about it and know everything started from 1-2 people and now countries discussing it some accepting some refusing, energy companies starting mining, it feels difficult for me to go back to zero.

We are happy to announce the re-launch of [C-Leak](https://c-leak.com/) game, but this time we are bringing real crypto currency as a reward for those clever enough to find them. There is more than $1,000 (at time of writing) in hidden Bitcoin wallets within the game.

&amp;#x200B;

For those not familiar with it, this is a web-browser game about cracking files leaked by a fictious hacktivist group called C-Leak. Those files are left available in a remotely accessible [Terminal](https://c-leak.com/terminal). Your goal is to discover their passwords and decrypt those files and by doing so, you may endup earning some real Bitcoins.

&amp;#x200B;

The password discovering method varies from file to file. It can be solving riddles, puzzles, mathematical problems, lateral thinking; or image, videos, sound and other file data manipulation; or external accessible content; etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Every decrypted file reveals compromising data about unethical companies, people, and governments. Combining those sensitive info forms a narrative about that fraudulent entity, and with that you can understand more about their hidden truth (some are really mind-blowing).

Bitcoin,"Since there are a lot of Trezor users in this subreddit, we decided to share this informative post with you. 

We strongly suggest our users keep their Trezor devices up to date as firmware updates bring new features and security improvements. This post describes the most frequent issues users encounter when updating their  Trezor devices. However, there is no need to be scared of updating your Trezor because as long as you have your recovery seed (and a  passphrase if you use this feature), you always have access to your funds.

**1. Device is wiped during the update**

If something goes wrong during the update (e.g. your device loses connection), your device automatically wipes itself as a protection against potential physical attack during which someone may try to install unofficial firmware on your device.

How to prevent that? Ensure the USB cable is properly plugged in, and do not disconnect the device while its firmware is updated.

However,  you don't need to worry if your device is wiped. All you need to do is to import your recovery seed to your Trezor. Here is how to do it with  
Trezor Model One: [https://trezor.io/learn/a/recover-wallet-on-trezor-model-one](https://trezor.io/learn/a/recover-wallet-on-trezor-model-one)  
Trezor Model T: [https://trezor.io/learn/a/recover-wallet-on-trezor-model-t](https://trezor.io/learn/a/recover-wallet-on-trezor-model-t)

**2. You find your wallet empty after the update**

Was your device wiped during the update, and you cannot see your balance in your wallet upon recovery? You either imported the wrong seed to your device or did not use the correct passphrase (if you use any).

For tips on what to do in this case, please read this post (points 1 and 2): [https://www.reddit.com/r/TREZOR/comments/ygl5n7/missing\_coins/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TREZOR/comments/ygl5n7/missing_coins/).

**3. Your device is not recognized when the update is initiated**

See our Knowledge base article for tips on what to do if Trezor Suite does not recognize your device: [https://trezor.io/support/a/trezor-suite-doesn-t-see-my-device](https://trezor.io/support/a/trezor-suite-doesn-t-see-my-device).",For Trezor users: Potential Firmware update issues,1.0,1,1093zda,kaacaSL,0,2023-01-11 12:53:29,1673441623,1673441624,2023-01-11,12:53:29

Bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are exhibiting premium over the cryptocurrency‚Äôs spot market price for the first time since the collapse of FTX Exchange in early November. The restored premium suggests that institutional activity has shifted focus away from bearish bets, as suggested by the record discounts seen in CME futures during the market panic.

However, the term structure ‚Äì the difference between futures of different maturities at a given time ‚Äì remains inverted or in backwardation, signaling caution among institutional investors.

Bitcoin,"Hi All,

I'm a **BIG** fan of Bitcoin, having read the WP years ago when the project was still in its infancy, and finally became an investor when the 2013 bubble was just getting kicked off. I've been an evangelist for it since then as I believe it will radically change the world in positive ways (if you ask my friends, they will let you know that I can't shut up about it).

Since about 2019, I've been working on a side project for a baseball site, titled [Scout the Statline](https://scoutthestatline.com/) \- if you're a fan of fantasy baseball (dynasty-style in particular), or card collecting, or just like baseball and numbers, I'd love if you checked us out and gave us your thoughts on what we're doing. Our goal is to use data modeling to highlight the minor and major leagues' most interesting players and prospects. What makes us unique is that everything is data-based and updated on a daily basis to bring instant info and insights to our users.

You're probably thinking ""*what does baseball have to do with Bitcoin?*"" Well not much, directly at least. But since these two things are passions of mine, I'm trying to integrate them. We offer a subscription for access to premium content and accept Bitcoin as payment. However, what I'm looking for are thoughts or ideas on how we can set up subscriptions using Bitcoin (Lightning would be preferred).

We would need to gather a users email address at the very least, to provide them with access. I presume that I'd need to use a payments platform to do it right, but want to gather thoughts.

Can any of you share thoughts or insights on the best way I can accomplish this?

Thanks,

Bitcoin,"A lot of bitcoin users I have come across seem to lack a proper understanding of how to use bitcoin, despite using it for a long time. On multiple occasions, people I know who have been using bitcoin for months even years ask me what a transaction ID is or how to check if a transaction is confirmed. 

On the one side, it is positive that people are opening to bitcoin but the lack of basic knowledge is a bit concerning, as it can make them take wrong decisions and lose money. 

I have compiled a short list of some of the terms I get asked quite often...

1) Bitcoin Block Explorer: An online interface for searching, tracking, and viewing all bitcoin transactions. 

To track your transactions you can use any of these explorers: 

* Mempool.space
* Blockonomics.co 

2) Transaction ID: Once a bitcoin transaction is broadcasted to the blockchain, a unique identifier is created to identify and verify the transaction.  You can use this ID in the blockchain explorer to track your transaction and see if it has confirmed or not. 

You will find this ID in the wallet you used to send/receive the transaction. 

3) Wallet Address:  The random string of letters and/or numbers that are used to send, receive, and store bitcoin. Each address is unique and *somewhat* similar to a bank account number of an individual but with way more privacy and security features.

Bitcoin address looks something like this: bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq

4) Fee:  The fee you have to pay to validate your transaction on the blockchain. This fee is dynamic and changes with time. 

5) Confirmation: The validation of a transaction on the blockchain is known as confirmation or *first confirmation.* To successfully receive bitcoin, your transaction needs to confirm, you use your transaction ID and explorer to check this.

Bitcoin,"I invested in Crypto since 2021. I am following r/bitcoin of course. And I appreciate BTC as the first, most important and safest Cryptocurrency of all time. I understand big investors who only invest in BTC because it can provide them a lot of profit with relative small price changes, and it has a big upward potential at the same time.
But for small investors it might make more sense to invest small amounts into altcoins with smaller MC, higher risk, but also bigger upward potential. 
Psychologically it's also more satisfying to own some millions or even billions of something than a small fraction of something.
If I would hit a lucky punch I would trade some of my portfolio to BTC of course. But the bearmarket was in the way up to now.

Bitcoin,"Indicators are a key component of technical analysis, used to help traders and investors identify trends, patterns, and opportunities in the market. But with so many indicators to choose from, it can be overwhelming to know where to start.

One of the most basic and widely used indicators is the moving average. A moving average takes the average closing price of a security over a set number of periods, and plots it as a line on a chart. This helps to smooth out short-term fluctuations and reveal longer-term trends.

Another popular indicator is the relative strength index (RSI), which compares the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses to determine overbought or oversold conditions. The RSI is typically plotted on a scale of 0-100, with levels above 70 indicating overbought conditions and levels below 30 indicating oversold conditions.

But beyond the basics, there are countless other indicators available, each with their own unique capabilities and strengths. Some indicators, such as the Bollinger Bands, use standard deviation to measure volatility, while others, such as the Fibonacci retracement, use geometric ratios to identify potential levels of support and resistance.

It's important to remember that indicators are just one tool in a trader's arsenal. They should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as price action and fundamental analysis, to give a more complete picture of the market. And while indicators can be helpful, they are not always accurate and can produce false signals.

Bitcoin,"# From Concept to Reality: The Birth and Growth of Bitcoin üçä

# 

The days of being tied to traditional forms of a currency controlled by governments are gone. #Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency, allows you to send funds from anywhere in the world to anywhere else, instantly, securely, and with minimal fees (if any at all).

But the story of Bitcoin goes back much further than its practical uses. It all started in 2008 with Satoshi Nakamoto, who introduced the world to a decentralized network capable of achieving consensus without any central authority.

This concept, known as the Byzantine Generals' Problem in the world of computer science and distributed systems, had stumped experts since it was first described in 1982. That is, until Nakamoto claimed to have found a solution.

Initially met with laughter and dismissal, Nakamoto went on to publish software that allowed the creation of the Bitcoin network just three months after releasing his groundbreaking paper. AKA, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash.

Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin is not a company or organization, but rather a standard or protocol similar to TCP/ IP or the internet. It operates based on a set of mathematical rules agreed upon by all participants in the network. Thanks to this system and the invention of Nakamoto, Bitcoin allows for a completely decentralized network of computers to reach a consensus on transactions happening on the network, effectively determining who holds the money.

In this peer-to-peer network, sending money from one account to another is as easy as sending an email - there's no intermediary. Every 10 minutes, the entire network reaches a consensus on what transactions have occurred through a simple electronic election, all without the need for a central authority.

But the real significance of Bitcoin lies in its potential for a decentralized organization on a scale never before seen. Yes, it can be used as a currency, but it also has the ability to revolutionize voting, stock ownership, asset registration, and even notarization. Don't get caught up in the fluctuating price of Bitcoin the currency - instead, understand the revolutionary technology and network it has created.

&amp;#x200B;

**Since the inception of Bitcoin, the following consensus rules have remained unchanged:**

1. A maximum of 21 million Bitcoins will ever be produced
2. A target of 10-minute block intervals
3. Halving events occurring every 210,000 blocks (roughly every 4 years)
4. A block reward starting at 50 and halving continually at each halving event until it reaches 0 (estimated to occur around 2140)

&amp;#x200B;

Any change to these parameters requires the consensus of all Bitcoin participants. So, not only does Bitcoin provide a decentralized network for financial transactions, but it also has a decentralized system for decision-making and rule-setting.

Bitcoin,"Hey all, I've been going down the rabbit hole these past 7 months. There's a thought I'm trying to work through and I was wondering if someone could sharpen my thinking on this. I would appreciate it if you could either correct any missing information or lapse in logic. 

So I was listening to a debate between Greg Foss, Peter McCormack and Peter Schiff. 

One of Schiff's arguments was money can only work if its commodity money. He gave the example that if the gold price for whatever reason starts plummeting, it cannot go to zero. Reason being, it will be bought up by industries for their use value. Namely, electronics, dental fillings and Jewelry or sculpture/art.  

Schiff claims bitcoin can go to zero because there is not use value in the physical world. No one needs it for computer parts, no one can eat it, etc. 

I find this argument to be incorrect. 

I can't find the exact year, but it seems like gold was first utilized as components in electronic devices in the early 1900s. 

That leaves thousands of years where gold's only use value was in dentistry and jeweler. 

I think we can dismiss jewelry as a use case for gold. Why? Because jewelry is about signaling power and wealth. Why not wear a necklace made with fool's gold? They could make it just as pretty with a nice yellow shine. 

If there was another another magical metal in history that had all the properties of gold, plus it was only accessible by a 24 word phrase that only the bearer knows, and can teleport it to the other side of the world, would there be a demand for jewelry made from this magic metal? Meanwhile, would the demand for gold jewelry go down considerably? I think so. 

It's accurate to say gold's properties as a money makes people want to make jewelry out of it. Not that people desire to make jewelry out of gold because its a beautiful shiny malleable metal. Gold jewelry is kind of a side effect or application of gold's value. It doesn't seem like a use case to me because once gold's monetary value is gone, most of the demand for gold jewelry will disappear. 

In regards to dentistry, there's a bunch of other metals that can be used including silver. 

So the conclusion I'm coming to with this reasoning is, other than dentistry, Gold was largely a useless rock up until it was used for electronics. 

It functioned as a money for thousands of years because of it's chemical properties lend well to use as a money. 

If gold has function with almost no use case in the real world for thousands of years, why can't bitcoin? Doesn't this mean Schiff's argument is kind of weak here?

I have known most of the managers for years at this point. We are of all ages, 20s-40s. We are looking for someone with experience, and who would undoubtably be committed to being active. I don't care if you are active in the chat, but you must be attentive when there are confirmations needed. You must be able to respond within 24hrs of any confirmations needed.

The platform will be Yahoo. I, as the commissioner, will post a $50BTC award to winner of the League yearly. Why Bitcoin? Its borderless. This league has people from Canada, US, and Europe. I can easily send $50 at super low cost instantly to the winner. Plus BTC fluctuates up and down, so some years the winner will take home more. I figured I had to add incentive in order to keep competition high.

1)**Buy and hold**: You can buy a cryptocurrency and hold it in the hope that its value will increase over time. This is similar to investing in stocks, except it can be more volatile due to the nature of the cryptocurrency market.

2)**Trading**: You can buy and sell cryptocurrencies on exchanges as prices fluctuate. This can be a risky strategy, as the market is highly volatile, but it can also be profitable for those with the knowledge and skills to navigate it successfully. 

3)**Earn Cryptocurrency:** Some platforms and websites allow you to earn cryptocurrency by completing tasks or providing a service. For example, you may be able to earn Bitcoin by contributing your computing power to a cryptocurrency mining pool, or you may be able to earn cryptocurrency by participating in a token sale or initial coin offering (ICO).

4)**Accepting Cryptocurrency as Payment** ‚Äì ‚Äã‚ÄãIf you own a business, you can accept cryptocurrency as payment from customers. This can be a good way to get involved in the cryptocurrency market and potentially benefit from its growth.

5)**Earning interest on cryptocurrency**: Some cryptocurrency platforms and lending services allow you to earn interest on your cryptocurrency holdings. This can be a good way to generate passive income from your cryptocurrency investments.

Bitcoin,"As a crypto holder you are betting on the demand of the coin rising, but there is no calculable value.

As a owner of a stock, you have a legal right to the cash flows which then gives those calculable value. If you believe a company will never grow and pay a dividend of $2 forever and you want to earn 10%, it is intrinsically worth $20. Now things can go wrong with that forecast or improve and get a higher or lower return, but the return estimate is based in verifiable math

Back to crypto, if you want to be inflammatory call it greater fool theory. If you want to be fair, you are betting on someone buying it from a higher price. But there is no intrinsic reason as to why someone would pay more. You don‚Äôt get a pro-rated share of the earnings of crypto (there are none), or a percentage of users or an adoption dividend or anything. You just own a coin. No different than a sports card.

The best example I can think that is similar to crypto but shows the difference in value with a stock is Visa. Visa processes $14 trillion in payments annually, if you own the company the get a small percentage of that as they process more transactions, all else equal it will be worth more. 

With bitcoin or any coin, if bitcoin increases it‚Äôs volume you have no reason for the coin to gain value because you don‚Äôt get anything logically by transactions going up. Your back to hoping someone will pay more than you did. This is the main difference between stocks and crypto values.

Bitcoin,"There is a lot of fear around setting up a multi-sig wallet. Whether it's the setup itself or the fear of restoring the wallet from scratch, it can be intimidating to move from single sig into the wonderful world of multi-sig. 

But it's worth it. 

As your stack grows to be a more and more substantial part of your wealth, so will the fear of losing your stack via a single point of failure with single sig.

I know that there are ways to create redundancy and security with single sig (e.g. SD card wallet backups, multiple seedphrase locations, passphrases). But I would argue that if you are willing to create redundancy and extra security with single sig, you already have the motivation (and likely the technical expertise) to move to multi-sig.

So enter multi-vendor multi-sig + sparrow. 

First, why multi-sig in general? There are two major compelling reasons for multi-sig 1.Redundancy from single key loss or theft (this one is obvious). 2. Plausible deniability in a $5 wrench attack. This second one was the main one that made me move to multi-sig. In the ever increasing world of data leaks and KYC, it has become almost impossible to stay incognito as a bitcoiner. Having multi-sig makes the effort to physically coerce you so much more difficult if an attacker has to transport you to another location (especially if it's a public place, like a bank security deposit box). And as multi-sig becomes the norm, then physically coercive attacks become less tempting as a whole in the space.

Second, Sparrow wallet makes multi-sig setup a breeze. To start, it's open-source. The UI is so much more user friendly than electrum and it automatically prompts super important steps (like downloading the backup script to restore the wallet). It has been formatted to work seamlessly with almost all the major hardware wallets. 

Finally, why multi-vendor multi-sig? Why not just 3 coldcards in a 2-of-3 setup or 5 trezors in a 3-of-5 setup? By creating a setup where no vendor has a quorum of keys (e.g. 2 coldcards, 2 bitboxes, 1 trezor), you remove that tiny little worry that one of the companies could be malicious and has somehow gotten your keys (either via a USB connection or incomplete entropy at key generation). Or that you've been the target of a supply chain attack. Technically, you should even be able to trust closed source hardware wallets (e.g. ledger) in a setup like this. Still recommending open source though, as a matter of principle in the bitcoin space.

However, if you go down this route, these are the absolute imperatives to setting up a multi-sig wallet:

1. YOU MUST BACKUP YOUR WALLET AND STORE A COPY OF ALL THE XPUBS (preferably in both electronic and physical form). If you need to restore your wallet from scratch, you will need the xpubs of ALL the keys, not just a quorum. This is by far the biggest pitfall of multi-sig. Luckily, Sparrow prompts you to create this backup at the time of wallet creation.
2. At least 1 (preferably all) of your hardware wallets needs to be able to verify the multi-sig wallet (including the XPUBs) of ALL signers ON THE DEVICE.  I won't go into too much detail, but malware could insert additional cosigners at the time of wallet creation, so you need an external validation of the wallet setup. Hardware wallets that I know can do this from personal experience are bitbox, coldcard, and foundation passport. I'm sure there are others but I can't speak to those.
3. This applies to both single and multi-sig, but you should always verify send and receive addresses on the hardware device itself. I will plug for foundation passport on this one. They make receive address verification via QR code very streamlined.

There's a lot more to the actual use of multisig, including using PSBTs with certain hardware wallets, but these actually don't differ from single-sig, other than having to do it multiple times rather than just once per transaction.

I could go on and on about other aspects (2-of-3 vs 3-of 5, storage location of keys, seedless setups), but this post is getting long. If you are interested in seeing sparrow in action with multi-sig, here's a great video that finally prompted me to go with Sparrow: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ\_SpQX\_YKw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ_SpQX_YKw) (Multisig starts at 25:04).","Multi-vendor Multi-sig + Sparrow Wallet: One of, if not the best, self-sovereign solutions to self-custody",1.0,1,106kulg,Realistic-Jelly8133,0,2023-01-08 14:43:25,1673189022,1673189022,2023-01-08,14:43:25

Bitcoin,"Here are some Pros and Cons of Bitcoin:

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

&amp;#x200B;

Decentralized: Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by any government or financial institution. This gives users more control over their own money and makes it harder for external parties to censor or seize their funds.

&amp;#x200B;

Limited supply: There is a limited supply of Bitcoin, with a maximum of 21 million coins that will ever be created. This can make it a good store of value, as the limited supply could potentially lead to an increase in the value of the remaining coins.

&amp;#x200B;

Secure: Bitcoin uses a technology called blockchain, which is a decentralized and secure ledger of all transactions. This makes it difficult for hackers to steal Bitcoin or manipulate the blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

&amp;#x200B;

Volatility: The price of Bitcoin is known to be volatile, with large swings in value occurring over short periods of time. This can make it risky to hold as an investment, as it is difficult to predict how the price will change in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Limited acceptance: While Bitcoin is accepted by a growing number of merchants and individuals, it is still not widely accepted as a form of payment. This can make it difficult to use in day-to-day transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

Complexity: Bitcoin and blockchain technology can be complex and may be difficult for some people to understand. This can make it less accessible to the general public and may limit its adoption.

&amp;#x200B;

Regulatory uncertainty: The regulatory status of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is still uncertain in many countries. This can create uncertainty for investors and users, and may discourage some people from using or investing in Bitcoin.",I asked GPT3 Pros and Cons of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin,"Hello Bitcoin enthusiasts!

As we enter the new year, I wanted to share some thoughts on why I believe Bitcoin (BTC) is a strong investment opportunity in 2023. While many people are aware of the more well-known reasons for investing in BTC, such as its limited supply and role as a store of value, here are some lesser-known factors to consider:

1. Institutional adoption: In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of institutional investors, such as hedge funds and pension funds, adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. This trend is likely to continue in 2023, which could provide a boost to the value of BTC.
2. Increasing use in developing countries: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being used more and more as a way to transfer money internationally, especially in developing countries where traditional financial systems may be less stable or accessible. This trend could drive up demand for BTC.
3. Potential for further halvings: Bitcoin's block reward, which is the amount of new BTC issued with each block, is set to halve again in 2024. This event, known as the ""halving,"" has historically had a positive impact on the price of BTC.
4. Infrastructure improvements: The Bitcoin network is constantly evolving and improving, with new technologies being developed to make it faster, cheaper, and more secure. These improvements could make BTC a more appealing investment.
5. Diversification benefits: Adding Bitcoin to a diversified investment portfolio can potentially provide a hedge against market volatility and economic uncertainty.

[HOW TO PREPARE FOR CLAT AS A STUDENT OF CLASS 11TH?](https://preview.redd.it/idqo56b7qlaa1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79e7b45e32d90344bdd99f2bfbf0bba7b141339d)

For law students, the Common Law Admission Test is a crucial test. 19 National Law Universities administer CLAT. These law schools are highly regarded. An NLU on a rotating basis administers the admission test annually according to their founding year. 

If you want to pursue a career in law early on, you can begin CLAT preparation in your 11th grade, which will give you an advantage on the CLAT exam.

**To pass the national level CLAT exam, a two-year preparation plan is more than sufficient**. You should not take it lightly or waste time thinking you have plenty of time because it is a step in your career. Never forget that every minute counts. A head start will give you the flexibility to finish the Class XI syllabus.

**Spend at least three hours per day in 11th grade CLAT preparation**. Every day, start reading the newspaper either in the morning or after a break. Despite how tedious it is, make an effort to read it every day. You'll read more quickly and learn about important events thanks to it. While studying the static GK portion, stay current on the news from the prior year.

**If you have the time, concentrate on reading books like CLAT Companion for Legal Aptitude** and Legal Aptitude/Legal Reasoning by AP Bharadwaj. Responding to questions involving reasoning is a major challenge for students in legal situations. Deep reading is the only way to solve this. One can better understand the law by reading. Collect good CLAT study material.

**One needs to practice a lot to master the logical reasoning** and elementary mathematics sections. Each day, you must at least cover one topic using MCQs. You need to brush up on your grammar and comprehension skills for the verbal section. Try to solve one or two comprehension exercises each day. One should, however, develop their own strategy based on their strengths and weak points.

**Considering that CLAT will be administered over a two-year period**, the preparation strategy should be straightforward. However, law students should keep in mind that they will also need to attend their regular academic classes, which will leave them with much less time. They must finish the majority of their CLAT preparation in the first one and a half years while only the self-assessment and mock tests can be completed in the final six months. In the interim, they must also prepare for their 12th board exams.

I have no idea why they restricted my account. I was plainly just staking.   
I asked if I can withdraw funds, and they said yes, but I can't trade, so I can withdraw only to the same currency storage. I thought it was great and tried to retrieve my euros, but it got ""held"" when I tried to unstake them.

Bitcoin,"#  The Accumulation/Distribution Indicator (A/D)

Accumulation/distribution ([A/D](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accumulationdistribution.asp)) is a cumulative indicator that uses¬†[volume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp)¬†and price to assess whether a stock is being accumulated or distributed. The accumulation/distribution measure seeks to identify¬†[divergences](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/divergence.asp)¬†between the stock price and volume flow. This provides insight into how strong a trend is. If the price is rising but the indicator is falling this suggests that buying or accumulation volume may not be enough to support the price gain and a decline may be coming.

The A/D indicator is cumulative, meaning one period's value is added or subtracted from the last. A rising A/D line helps confirm a rising price trend, while a falling A/D line helps confirm a price downtrend. If the price is rising but A/D is falling, it signals underlying weakness and a potential decline in price, and vice-versa.

Bitcoin," 

Since its creation, the use and acceptance of bitcoin as a form of payment has evolved significantly. In the early days of bitcoin, it was primarily used as a way to send and receive payments between individuals, and there were few merchants who accepted it as a form of payment. However, as bitcoin has gained in popularity and mainstream awareness, more and more merchants have begun to accept it as a form of payment.

Today, there are a wide range of merchants and companies that accept bitcoin as payment, including major retailers such as Overstock, Expedia, and Microsoft. In addition, many smaller merchants and online retailers also accept bitcoin as a form of payment. While the use of bitcoin as a form of payment is still not as widespread as traditional payment methods, it is growing steadily and is becoming more accepted by merchants and consumers alike.

Bitcoin,"Basically there is a very large number of globally distributed nodes (banks) that transact with each other and that keeps a vee of their own ledger and they settle it every day or every couple of days to reconcile all the amounts. Yes not every bank has every transaction or every account balance but only those of their customers, but still, its distributed, decentralized, chained (though not cryptographically). So the only difference to btc is that btc has one ledger with everything, it is cryptographically verifiable (so it's trust less) and its faster.

OK arguably the banks are actually the layer 2 and clearing houses of the swift system are the layer 1 (which is more centralised than the banking system). 

Assuming the above is true then maybe a better way to explain btc is not by explaining the tech and blockchain etc but rather by saying something like btc is like an alternative to the swift system and its clearing houses that is decentralized, open, and not controlled by any one entity, it is faster and fully transparent.

And if we say that, then the question comes - do ""the powers that be"" actually want competition in this manner... (not that they can stop it per se but they can outlaw it just like files haring cannot be stopped but be outlawed or made very inconvenient).

Bitcoin,"https://seedle.io

Today we're officially launching a website called Seedle.io that enables people to enhance the security of their wallets by scrambling the order of their seed phrases based on a secret key.  

The way it works is that a secret key generates a unique combination of scrambled numbers that map to the actual order of a seed. For example the key ""Hello World"" generates this combination:  

1  13    &gt;&gt;    9  11  
2  14    &gt;&gt;    4  14  
3  15    &gt;&gt;    13 20  
4  16    &gt;&gt;    23 24  
5  17    &gt;&gt;    8  12  
6  18    &gt;&gt;    2  5  
7  19    &gt;&gt;    6  16  
8  20    &gt;&gt;    22 21  
9  21    &gt;&gt;    3  15  
10 22    &gt;&gt;    **1**  18  
11 23    &gt;&gt;    10 19  
12 24    &gt;&gt;    7  17  

The sequence on the left side represents the false order and the combination on the right side represents the true order. What we get is that instead of #1 actually being the first phrase in the seed, the combination reveals that the first phrase is at #9, #2 is at #4, and so on... Note that the bolded **1** in the 10th position is meant to be replaced with an incorrect phrase from the list of 2024 words.

This scrambled order creates a layer of cryptographic security that obscures the true identity of a seed. The difficulty of guessing the correct order is 2048^24 or 2.96 x 10^79. To put that into perspective, a computer guessing 2^23 or 8,388,608 combinations per second would take 3.65 * 10^95 years to exhaust all possible combinations.  

The best part of this security enhancement is that you do not need to enter your seed phrase anywhere. All that's required is a password that only you know. The rest of the process is using the combination as your ""seed"" and hiding it as usual (or not). Here's mine:

2. It is highly likely 90%+ of transactions are on the dark web due to it being on exchanges and using an interface and system you only get AFTER you log in and that isn't searchable on Google. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then again, there could be a debate if 100% is the right number. Like all the transactions are happening over the blockchain over the internet. On one hand the transaction isn't indexed on Google or whatever. Like if it is, then it would be a while after. But then again, you can use tools that is available to the public without logging in to view the blockchain. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR

If someone freaks out about the ""dark web"" or ""dark net"" or they listen to this fearmongering. Make sure they know their email is on the dark web. You have to log in to see it, and it isn't public indexed.

* BTC Lightning Network continues disrupting the payments industry by showing consistent growth and increasing user confidence each year.   

* In 2022 alone, payments made through the Lightning Network grew by 97% and accounted for 6.29% of all orders paid in Bitcoin, compared to 4.53% in 2021. That means, on average, last year, every 16th order at CoinGate was paid using the Lightning Network layer.   

* In general, 2022 was great for the Lightning Network as the capacity in BTC has doubled over the year while the node count has also increased, signaling a speeding-up adoption of its use. 

Knowing how much effort in development is put into this technology, it‚Äôs unlikely to see the adoption rate slowing down anytime soon.

Bitcoin,"Hey all,

I recently set up my own LND (Lightning Network Daemon) node and have been learning about the best practices for managing and optimizing it. One thing I've been struggling with is rebalancing my channels to ensure that they are evenly balanced and not costing me more in fees than they are worth.

After some research, I discovered a really easy way to rebalance my LND node using a tool called LNRebalance. It's an open-source command-line tool that can automatically rebalance my node based on configurable criteria, such as the minimum and maximum channel balance and the maximum fee percentage.

To use LNRebalance, all I had to do was install it using the go get  
 command and then run it from the terminal with the desired options. It handled the rest of the rebalancing process automatically, saving me a lot of time and effort.

If you're running your own LND node and are looking for an easy way to rebalance your channels, I highly recommend giving LNRebalance a try. It's been a game-changer for me, and I hope it can help you too!

Upon asking, ""how PGP key lead to losing Bitcoin? I mean if he using Hot Wallet then it probably should be very secure"", he replied, "" Everything is compromised. ""

That is a nice explanation. 

Another Twitter user said, "" I don't buy this. You of all people should have at least some basic Opsec, and you are leading us to believe you kept over 200 BTC on a hot wallet? ""

Luke's response was lukewarm: ""No, they got my cold wallet too somehow ""

Those that are in the space for a while understand that unless their keys are compromised or stolen, it is impossible to hack a cold wallet. Never happened till data, the history of cold wallets speaks for itself. But, it is coming from a Bitcoin core developer, which is concerning because if he can't keep his Bitcoin secure, who really can?

When asked, "" Doesn't sound like a cold wallet if your keys were on a computer connected to the internet, or am I misunderstanding the situation? ""

His response: "" They weren't supposed to be.  I agree they must have been somehow.""

Now, Luke is one of the OGs of space, and if he could lose Bitcoins, an average Joe certainly can. However, with a cold wallet, it is not possible; it is what is being told to all of us at the least. 

Then comes in CZ with his tweet:  Sad to see even an OG Bitcoin Core Developer lost 200+ BTC ($3.5 million). Self custody have a different set of risks.""

Wow! What a brilliant way to market your services! Hitting the iron when it's hot. Kudos

Bitcoin,"Id like to offer a few charts I've been working on for an open discussion. All opinions, thoughs and suggestions are welcome. 

A few notes to begin:

* Orange vertical line is a halving date.
* Green line is top forecast for next cycle, the date chosen is the average time to top from the previous 2 halvings. 
* Line of best fit is exponential (looks linear on a log base graph).
* Chart Y Axis is Log Scale (base10).

First Chart - 3 Halvings:

[Top Estimate - 450K](https://preview.redd.it/wzq9973tzw9a1.png?width=1687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829bbbf1509d6bf3e6930835c7175268eb9dfe52)

Second Chart - 2 Halvings:

[Top Estimate - 300K](https://preview.redd.it/l7lbimutzw9a1.png?width=1685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=794f6e34435e6572f1de63d16db7d90167143349)

Third Chart - Previous Low to Current Low:

[Top Estimate - 200K](https://preview.redd.it/c2b71nuuzw9a1.png?width=1682&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30eb2e9e4f675bb1843ff3531a4e5264b1f19d70)

**Discussion:**

It's interesting to see, the lower the timeframe that the chart looks back, the lower the forecast high of the next cycle is. I believe the reason is due to the diminishing ""blow-off tops"" we are seeing from cycle to cycle. I have a theory for that - bitcoin network access to new funds:

*  The first cycle, Bitcoin gained access to a new pool of funds, ""first movers"". 
* The second cycle, Bitcoin also gained access to a new pool of funds through a rise in exchanges providing easy access. 
* The third cycle, Bitcoin gained access to new funds through a large increase in media coverage. 
* The fourth cycle (current cycle), Bitcoin didn't gain access funds that would make as significant a step change to the price as it had in previous cycles. 

As such, the lack of blow-off top in the current cycle effects the best fit price forecast more significantly when the time period examined is lower. 

So, where should the top estimate fall, with such a wide range showing in the charts between **200K** and **450K**? 

* With no significant increase in access to new funds, I'm looking at 200K as a top.
* If several **larger** nations start to adpot BTC as legal tender, I'm looking at 350K as a top. 
* If several larger nations and institutions gain access through clear and favorable regulation, then I'm looking at 450K as a top. 

I believe on a log scale, these events have a similar impact to the previously discussed events in past cycles such as first movers, rise in exchanges and increase in media converage. We are currently at 16/17K, suggesting from the current value we see a **1200-2800 %** increase to the top of the next cycle. 

The better question, I think, is what should an exit strategy look like? Well, we currently have 482 days until the next halving and 1007 days until the estimated top based on previous cycles (2016 cycle was 525 days from halving to top, 2020 cycle was 546 days from halving to top). With 2.75 years to top, an exit strategy is a tough question to consider, especially considering the swings in monetary policy over the last 2 years. 

For now, I'm looking purely at the time to top and its correlation with the halving. The halving event inherrently forms a supply demand crunch, causing upward pressure on the price. Significant upward prices always lead to FOMO and hence an overshoot on true valve, as we have seen in every cycle. The time duration of this overshoot has always been roughly the same in the BTC space (again, 524 &amp; 546 days in the past 2 cycles), if there is one thing I am willing to rely on, it is that human nature repeats itself. This date, for those curious, is 7th of October 2025. 

What would have me re-evaluate the estimated top date is if one of the aformentioned events (large nations adopting BTC and institutional access) occurs 12+ months after the halving, in which case I think we could see the top date pushed further out due to a late boom in access to new funds. In this case, I would start to look at the 300/450K to form the basis of my exit strategy, rather than a set date. 

Let us know your thoughts!

*As a final though provoker, we often see an estimate cap put on BTC due to its similarity to gold as a store of value, ""digital gold"". The valuation of the gold market is roughly 10T. However, is estimated to be 1:200ish physical to paper ratio, why do we not see this considered when corrilating it in a store of value sense to BTC?*

Could bitcoin be an effective buffer in the electricity market in a state of hyperbitcoinisation?

1) Current bitcoin reward per day:

6.25 x (6 x 24) x $16000 = $14,400,000/day

(6.25 blocks every 10minutes for one day multiplied by  the bitcoin price)

2) Possible bitcoin reward in the future:

Assuming same proportional bitcoin reward and a bitcoin price of $10,000,000 (in a world of hyperbitcoinisation):

10,000,000/16000 x 14,400,000 = $9,000,000,000/day (9 billion dollars per day)

3) Total electricity expenditure per day currently:

82 exajoules per year

([https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/52f66a88-0b63-4ad2-94a5-29d36e864b82/KeyWorldEnergyStatistics2021.pdf](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/52f66a88-0b63-4ad2-94a5-29d36e864b82/KeyWorldEnergyStatistics2021.pdf))

44 billion per exajoule

(https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=cost+of+one+exajoule+of+electricity)

82 x 44,000,000,000 / 365 = $9,884,931,506 (9.8 Billion dollars per day)

4) Total new gold production per day:

3000 tonnes of gold per year

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/238414/global-gold-production-since-2005/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/238414/global-gold-production-since-2005/)

3000 tonnes of gold x $53 million per tonne / 365 = 435,000,000 (0.4 Billion dollars per day)

In the message body (not the subject) you have to use the command:

Bitcoin," If you're thinking about investing in cryptocurrency, you need to be aware of the risks. Here's why you should be careful with cryptocurrency.  


A lot of people are interested in cryptocurrency these days, but there are a few things to be aware of before investing. 

* First, it‚Äôs important to understand that cryptocurrency is still a relatively new technology and is therefore subject to a lot of volatility.
* Secondly, there have been a number of scams and hacks associated with cryptocurrency, so it‚Äôs important to be careful when dealing with it.

## Be careful with cryptocurrency

Investing in cryptocurrency is risky, and you should be careful before investing any money. Cryptocurrency values can fluctuate wildly, and investors can lose a lot of money if they don't know what they're doing. 

You should only invest money that you can afford to lose, and you should always consult with a financial advisor before investing. 

### Why you should be careful with cryptocurrency- you could lose everything

Cryptocurrencies are often traded on decentralized exchanges and can also be used to purchase goods and services. 

However, there are also many risks associated with investing in cryptocurrency. For example, the value of a cryptocurrency can fluctuate wildly, and you could lose all of your investment if you're not careful. 

Additionally, cryptocurrency exchanges are often hacked, and investors can lose all of their money if they don't have proper security measures in place.

Bitcoin," 

The telecom industry is facing a disproportionate demand and supply due to poor user experience and low accessibility of connectivity for consumers. Thus, those who develop and operate telecom networks don't have enough clients, which can lead to prolonged development of the market and skyrocketing service prices.

But with Weaver Labs, that's no longer the case. Their ecosystem aims to improve accessibility, enhance the user experience with a software-based platform, and unite those who build networks with those who consume them.

They've developed Cell-Stack, a software stack that aggregates all telecoms infrastructure and opens it up to be consumed as a service. It acts as an open marketplace of telecommunications assets, using blockchain technology to create a ""network of networks"" and bridge the gap in the telecoms area.

Cell-Stack offer s two types of followers } to interact with it: the supply side (those who own telecoms infrastructure) and the demand side (those who want to consume services). Blockchain technology is used to solve friction when accessing telecoms infrastructure, serving as a key governance component of the marketplace and coordinating trust among all the different players of the network.

With the rise of cloud networks and the open access model, which is more focused on users than on functionalities, now is the perfect moment to innovate the telecoms sector with cutting-edge Web 3.0. solutions.

On this day in 2009, the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, known as the Genesis block, was mined. This block contained the first 50 Bitcoins and marked the beginning of a revolutionary new form of money and technology.

The person or group of people behind the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto, released the Bitcoin white paper in 2008, outlining a decentralized digital currency that would be powered by a network of computers rather than a central authority. The idea was to create a secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant way to transfer value and store wealth.

Fast forward to today, and Bitcoin has become a household name, with millions of people around the world using it as a store of value, a means of exchange, and a way to participate in the global financial system.

Bitcoin,"Hello I‚Äôm trying to learn more about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. I watched a YouTube video and it got moe wondering a few things.

When all Bitcoins have been mined, then it is only transaction fees that will be paid to miners. In that case, the transaction fees would have to increase? Otherwise why would anyone mine? Or would there be other ways for miners to get a return? Or would there be self-sustainable mining (e.g. using solar) set up running automatically across the world that doesn‚Äôt generate a return.

If transaction fees are too high, does that then limit the use of Bitcoin? The value of anything is determined by what people view it to be worth, and if the use of Bitcoin is limited, would value of Bitcoin then fall, and could that lead to the whole Bitcoin project collapsing?

I just don‚Äôt see how it can continue to be feasible in the very long term.

Description

What is Bitcoin? An apparently simple question that hides a great deal of complexity.

Coming to understand Bitcoin in all its magnitude is difficult. Bitcoin is a constantly evolving system that requires knowledge in multiple disciplines. Game theory, philosophy, cryptography, networks and distributed systems, and economic and monetary theory, among others.

And while other books on Bitcoin focus on some of the areas of knowledge, creating a narrow view of the concept of Bitcoin, The Fundamentals of Bitcoin aims to give a 360-degree view through a journey divided into four chapters

The first chapter delves into the philosophical underpinnings and motivations for the creation of Bitcoin. A long road that begins in the late 80s with significant advances in modern cryptography, followed by a series of attempts to create private digital money by a group of cryptographers and programmers known as the cypherpunks, and with the 2008 financial crisis as a catalyst.

The second chapter recounts the events surrounding the publication of the Bitcoin white paper and the network‚Äôs launch, the influences that inspired its creation, and its evolution during the first years of existence and until the disappearance of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Finally, the chapter describes the steps for getting started with Bitcoin. From acquisition to receipt, transfer, or tracking bitcoin.

The third chapter focuses on the economic and financial fundamentals behind Nakamoto‚Äôs invention. It starts by exploring the origin of money, its functions, and the properties necessary for an asset or good to fulfill its mission as money. The chapter also analyzes Bitcoin‚Äôs monetary policy and its economic cycles.

The fourth and final chapter of the book examines the technical foundations through the study of Bitcoin‚Äôs four main components: the peer-to-peer network and its nodes, the blockchain and its transactions, the decentralized system for blocks and transactions verification, and the mining or Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. The chapter also provides a brief introduction to the Lightning Network, a second-layer solution built on top of Bitcoin.

Students in my classes frequently ask me how long it takes me to prepare the sessions where I explain Bitcoin. They refer to the preparation of the material. My response usually surprises them: more than five years and fifteen thousand hours of reading, studying, and building. My classes and this book are intended to help others shorten the learning curve and avoid the misinformation that frequently surrounds this wonderful invention.

Let me guide you on an incredible journey of learning what Bitcoin is and how it works, the decentralized digital money of the future, and one of the most important inventions of the 21st century.",The Fundamentals of Bitcoin - A new 360¬∞ view bitcoin book,1.0,1,101y6v0,alvarosb,0,2023-01-03 04:33:35,1672720432,1672720433,2023-01-03,04:33:35

The idea of sending some sort of 'value' from one person to another with no intermediary is powerful stuff but I am not sure where we are today. Please see my points below; 

\- I am not sure if BTC has evolved in the way we would have thought. People still do not use it for transferring value and if you believe the use case is more related to 'store of value', we dont even do that properly. Everyone just keeps their funds on an exchange. Its not their fault, people never really got comfortable with having a seedphrase where if you lose it or forget it, its over. There have been efforts to bright this gap (multi sig) but it never really took off. 

\- This entire sub is just about the price. EVERYONE just cares about price. No one is doing some proper DD on whether BTC actually saving money on transactions, or how secure the blockchain is now as apposed to a year. Its all about price, which might be a red flag. I dont know.

Bitcoin,"I had the ability to buy btc at 13k...I decided to DCA. My friend had 3 btc that he bought at 2k, sold at 8k, then rebought at 20k.

There are two roads:

Road 1: your government is responsible, will run a balanced budget, and has a plan for the debt, has solutions for the massive amount of old people and their entitlements/care, and everything will be okay.

Road 2: your government is irresponsible, will NEVER run a balanced budget, has no plant for the debt and in fact says ""when rates are low we can borrow more"",  has no clue what to do/how to fund all these old people, and everything will not be okay.

You must think much differently than a 60 year old if you're 20. They are gone in 20 years. You are here for 60 more.

I'm 39. Society is more disjointed than ever. The vast majority of my friends will at most own their own home and many at 40 are literally having to gamble with their life savings on a home purchase or accept that they will never own anything. If you think you are going to time the market with a home, bitcoin, or stocks, you are not. 

The government has a big fucking problem and the next time they print you are going to have your currency diluted.

When I was 23 a 3 bd/2 bath house was 700k-now these same houses have ""Crashed"" to 1.6 at nearly the same rates. 

Do everything in your power to get at least 3 btc. It doesn't matter if they price goes to 20k, 10k, or 50k tomorrow. It doesn't matter what your favorite youtuber or twitter trader says.

Here's why you want 3 asap:  
You will sell 1 at 100k.

You will sell at least half at 250k.

You need 1 forever.  
This gives you .5 at most.

Bitcoin,"If you consider the following from the Manifesto:

&gt;The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few. In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.


&gt;We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man‚Äôs own labour, which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence. Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.

Fascinating that the discovery of Bitcoin has single handedly destroyed the entire theory of the communism, as for the first time in human history, private property can be granted to anyone in the world as a true bearer asset and those rights will be upheld by the network regardless of your class, background, real world influence. The hard work one puts into accumulating wealth to provide for and protect his family can be exchanged for a private property which is honest, sound, ethical, grounded in physics and mathematics. 

Most people on this planet cannot access banking and that is the biggest divider of wealthy inequality because money is half of everything we do. The simplicity of code has removed the marginalisation of the majority of people on this planet by establishing the same property rights for a multi billionaire in America and a poor farmer in Nigeria, while secured via true, free market capitalism with the mining industry.  Poor communities in rural areas are now able to tap into Locked up natural resources, that would‚Äôve otherwise gone to waste by expelling into the atmosphere and monetise the energy by mining bitcoin.

By implementing a system that respects true integrity, soundness and honesty, Satoshi Nakamoto has quite literally destroyed the main tenant of the Communist ideology by providing property rights to 8 billion people without exploiting a single being.",Reading the Communist Manifesto through Bitcoin lens is fascinating,1.0,1,100x9nv,itsnotthatdeepbrah,0,2023-01-01 23:47:07,1672616847,1672616847,2023-01-01,23:47:07

Human beings have a hard time understanding exponential growth for a number of reasons. One of the main reasons is that our brains are wired to think in linear terms. We are used to things growing or changing at a steady rate, and exponential growth does not follow this pattern.

Exponential growth is characterized by a rapid increase in which the rate of increase itself increases. This means that the growth becomes faster and faster over time. A common example of exponential growth is the concept of compound interest. If you invest a certain amount of money at a certain rate of interest, the amount of money you earn will increase over time. However, the rate of increase will also increase, so the longer you leave the money invested, the more it will grow.

This can be hard for people to wrap their heads around because it goes against our natural instincts. We are used to thinking about things in terms of how much they increase by a certain amount over a certain period of time. Exponential growth, on the other hand, increases by a certain percentage over a certain period of time, which means that the rate of increase itself increases.

Another reason why humans have a hard time understanding exponential growth is that it is difficult to visualize. When we think about growth, we tend to think about it in terms of physical objects or quantities that we can see and touch. However, exponential growth is not something that we can easily observe in the physical world. It is a mathematical concept that is difficult to visualize, which makes it harder for us to understand.

A further reason why exponential growth can be hard to understand is that it is often counterintuitive. For example, if you start with a small number and double it repeatedly, the resulting numbers may not seem very significant at first. However, if you keep doubling the number, it will eventually become much larger than you might have expected. This is because each time you double the number, you are adding a much larger amount than you did the time before.

Finally, humans have a hard time understanding exponential growth because it can lead to seemingly impossible or unbelievable outcomes. For example, if a virus were to double in size every day, it would seem impossible that it could take over the world in just a few short weeks. However, this is exactly what can happen with exponential growth. It may start off small, but it can quickly become much larger than anyone could have predicted.

If you are still with me, and are having a hard time connecting the concept of exponential growth to Bitcoin‚Ä¶ let me explain:

Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency, has seen exponential growth since its creation in 2009. One of the main reasons for this is that bitcoin has a limited supply. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence, and as more and more people become aware of and interested in bitcoin, the demand for it increases. This limited supply, combined with increasing demand, has led to the price of bitcoin experiencing exponential growth over time.

However, this exponential growth has also made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin. Because of its non-linear growth, it is difficult to use traditional financial models to forecast the price of bitcoin. This has led to a great deal of speculation and uncertainty surrounding the future of the currency.

Another factor contributing to the difficulty in understanding the exponential growth of bitcoin is the fact that it is a relatively new and highly complex technology. The use of blockchain, a decentralized ledger that records all bitcoin transactions, adds an additional layer of complexity to the currency. This complexity can make it difficult for people to fully understand how bitcoin works and how it is valued.

The exponential growth of bitcoin has been driven by a combination of limited supply, increasing demand, and the complexity of the technology behind it. This growth has made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin, but has also attracted a great deal of interest due to the potential for significant returns on investment.

In conclusion, humans have a hard time understanding exponential growth because it goes against our natural linear thinking, is difficult to visualize, is often counterintuitive, and can lead to seemingly impossible outcomes. It is important for people to understand this concept, however, because it can have significant implications in many different areas, including economics, population growth, and the spread of diseases.

TLDR: Exponential Growth is difficult for people to conceptualize because it goes against our natural linear thinking, is often counterintuitive and can lead to seemingly impossible outcomes. BTC has already experienced Exponential Growth multiple times and is still in its infancy.

Just want to let people know that someone before you made a lot of money from BTC doesn't mean you will make a lot of money.

Again, I am not saying BTC will not go to $1M in 2030, because I simply don't know.

Bitcoin,"...The one that says people are selling BTC before the end of the year for tax purposes: To realize 'capital losses'.

&gt; In years characterized by significant stock losses from almost everyone's portfolio, there's at least the small comfort of knowing that these losses can help you reduce your overall income tax bill.
&gt; 
&gt; According to U.S. tax law, the only capital gains or losses that can impact your income tax bill are ""realized"" capital gains or losses. Something becomes ""realized"" when you sell it.
&gt; 2
&gt;  So, a stock loss only becomes a realized capital loss after you sell your shares. If you continue to hold onto the losing stock into the new tax year, that is, after Dec. 31, then it cannot be used to create a tax deduction for the old year.
&gt; 
&gt; Although the sale of any asset you own can create a capital gain or loss, for tax purposes, realized capital losses are used to reduce your tax bill only if the asset sold was owned for investment purposes.
&gt; 1


Stocks and BTC fall within this definition. That's why many people are selling before the end of the year and will buy back in January.

‚Ä¢ The cost of electricity, which is one of the main expenses for miners, can vary greatly depending on where a mining operation is located.

‚Ä¢ In some areas, electricity may be generated primarily from renewable sources, which can be cheaper than electricity generated from fossil fuels under certain circumstances.

‚Ä¢ The cost of cooling equipment may be lower in some locations due to natural factors such as lower ambient temperatures or greater supply of more efficient cooling technology.

‚Ä¢ Some countries or regions may have regulations that make it difficult or expensive to set up a mining operation, while others may be more welcoming to the industry.

Bitcoin,"During testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on December 13, John Ray III, the newly appointed CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, told members of Congress that FTX U.S. had 2.7 million user accounts while FTX International had 7.6 million user accounts. That‚Äôs a total of 10.3 million potential customers of FTX that may have been bilked out of some or all of their funds by the alleged mastermind, Sam Bankman-Fried, and his co-conspirators. That‚Äôs more than 250 times the defrauded customers of Ponzi mastermind Bernie Madoff.

While Ray acknowledged that some FTX users had multiple accounts, even if you cut the 10.3 million user accounts by as much as two-thirds, 3.4 million accounts is still 85 times the number of Madoff victims.

If you throw into the mix that Madoff acquired his victims over more than four decades and Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs FTX has been in operation for less than four years, the scope of the number of people impacted is stunning. And if one considers the customer losses at other crypto companies that have filed bankruptcy, potentially as a result of their exposure to FTX, the total dollar amount of losses may come close to or even exceed the estimated $17.8 billion of lost principal in the Madoff fraud.

Bitcoin,"People are always praising Bitcoin for being ‚Äútrustless‚Äù and secure, yet they don‚Äôt know how to read code or run their own node. 

How many of you actually read the code and run your own node? 

I am going to guess that less than half of the people here neither read code nor run their own node. 

If that‚Äôs the case then by default you are trusting that the folks reading the code and tracking any changes made by the developers are scrutinizing it and would reject any changes by the developers that are negative to Bitcoin or not beneficial for the rest of us. This means we have to put our trust on programmers that read code. 

Obviously, those that run their own nodes and can read code have the financial incentive to keep the developers in check. This is very beneficial for us and is the reason why I trust these programmers. However don‚Äôt be unaware, that at the end of the day, you are putting trust in people.

Bitcoin,"There are people in the world today that are 10 years old. In 2022.

They probably won't be able to get a first job until 16 years old, which is 6 years from now, which is year 2028.

In the year 2028, what do you think bitcoin will be worth? I think at least 50k. If 2025 it goes to 100k, then crashes down to 30k in 2026, goes sideways a year in 2027 and up in 2028, bitcoin is 50k.

If you worked minimum wage at 16, in 2028, you probably are taking home 1000 a week if you were doing it full time?

Which means you would need to take home 1000 a week every single week that you are 16 years old (a full year) and not spend anything, to buy 1 bitcoin, assuming it stays at 50k.

BUT.... If it goes down in 2026, sideways in 2027, slightly up in 2028, then 2029 is the bull run. 

If 2029, it bull runs to 150k, the kid only has enough money for a third of a btc buying at the top, assuming he doesn't spend any money at all. If we assume he DCA'ed on the way up to 150 and bought the bear dip after 150 too, then maybe he has half a bitcoin or more.

Then, 2030 crashes to 50k, and the kid is 17, still bringing home 1000 a week, but now has a half bitcoin in his pocket, so now he needs only 25k to buy the other half, but he would have to spend the 25k at the exact bottom, which won't happen. 

If we assume he DCA's after 50 was hit and hovers around 80k for 2031, he would have to spend 40k of the 50k he will take home in 2031 to get the other half of the bitcoin.

So yeah, I guess there is a chance that today's 10 year old will be able to get to 1 bitcoin before his 18th birthday.

They‚Äôre argument is that in history after a red year the subsequent 2.5-3 years have been green. I agree with that but I just think that this recession will squash history. In 2019 and pretty much every year after the GFC of 2008 interest rates have been very low. In 2023 interest rates will be at 5% and the fed can continue their hawkish monetary stance if inflation doesn‚Äôt go down in a sustainable way. IMO unless the fed miraculously starts printing again next year we will probably see more downside and sideways action.

\- The BTC on the LN; how do they get there, and what is the incentive for someone to put their BTC on the LN? Doesn't it kind of go against the maxim of not your keys, not your coins?

\- When people like Jack Mallers (who I love) say things like transactions on LN will cost nothing or fractions of a penny, how is that possible? What's to stop a company like Stripe to just increase fees? 

\- How are the transactions secure? Base layer has validations happening, whats occurring on LN to validate and safeguard a transaction?

\- Are there any onboarding ramps yet, other than LN wallet apps? I know Jack spoke at length about connections to POS systems on retail, but where's the user onboarding going to come from? I'm trying to look at this from a retail PoV and see how I can get customers off of using CC's to pay for a $3 retail transaction.

\- Lastly, how does LN adoption benefit the price of BTC? I see this a lot, but the correlation reasoning often seems not based on substance. Its usually fluff like, more coins moving helps the price.

Bitcoin,"I saw a post about btc holdings earlier and since I check bitinfocharts quite often I thought of sharing my own version. So here it is; some interesting btc stats and info related to number of wallets, total holdings and categories of wallets. All stats are derived from bitinfocharts dot come and wayback machine. Enjoy! :)

&amp;#x200B;

On 30dec2022:

The number of wallets holding 1+ BTC reached an ATH of 977k

The number of wallets holding 0.1+ BTC reached an ATH of 4.2mil 

The number of wallets with 0.01+ BTC reached an ATH of 11,4 mil

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In 2022 from Jan till Dec the category of wallets holding between 1-10 btc increased from 724k to 822k. The BTC holdings for this category increased from 1.8mil to 2.0mil btc

In 2022 from Jan till Dec the category of wallets holding between 0.1-1 btc increased from 2.77mil to 3.22mil. The BTC holdings for this category increased from 859k to 1.0mil btc

In 2022 from Jan till Dec the category of wallets holding between 0.01 -0.1 btc increased from 6.68mil to 7.22mil. The BTC holdings for this category increased from 218k to 243k btc

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Where did the selling pressure come from?

Between jan22 and dec22 wallets holding between 1k-10k btc sold aproximately 471k btc. This category probably includes a lot of btc miners among others.

Between jan22 and dec22 wallets holding between above &gt;100k btc sold aproximately 108k btc. This category includes exchange wallets and probably accounts for withdrawals after black swan events (people moving their btc from exchanges to self custody).

&amp;#x200B;

Final thoughts. We know that 1 wallet is not equal to 1 person. Even so, taking everything into consideration, 2022 was a great year for retail with huge growth both in terms of # of wallets and amount of btc held by lower categories of holders, from 0.01+ btc up to 10btc. 

&amp;#x200B;

If we look at the current price of btc in $ vs actual demand (or lack of) we can see that there is still a huge road ahead.

Coin is 2.25 inches in diameter, will be printed in a greyish color off the HP machines. Binary text on border reads ""BITCOIN"". There is also a keychain version with a hole for the keychain to attach to it. Let me know which version you'd like if interested.

Bitcoin,"  

America is declining on the world stage and China will be the future.  
 

America has no manufacturing, our youth is dumb, the country is divided, and we are so wasteful with our money.   
 

In China there are no homeless people, you heard that right, there are no homeless people. In China you wont find people sleeping on the street or just begging for money, because they re-invest their money in to their country so they make sure anyone that needs a place to sleep has one. Where as in America, every major cities have people sleeping on the street and in some cities (mainly democratically ran) there are literally tent cities.   
 

China has already surpassed America in GDP measured by  PPP (Purchasing power parity). Purchasing power parity is basically how much buying power people have and the average Chinese person can afford more than the average American. In America we print so much money that everything is so expensive, rent averaging $1500 a month, with eating out for 2 cost on average like $100, where as in China everything is very cheap because they manufacturer for the world.   
 

China is expected to surpass America in NOMINAL GDP by 2028, (Nominal GDP is basically dollar for dollar in GDP). Which if you step back and really think about it, it is insane how rich China is. China doesn‚Äôt print dollars, so they are going to be able to accumulate more money than America, which prints the dollar. But what makes it more crazy is that the cost of living and cost to produce or do anything is much lower than in America, but yet they will have a higher NOMINAL GDP than America.   
 

America is political system is built heavily on the roman empire, and roman empire fell from inside. This is happening in America now as the country is heavily divided. But what makes our political system so bad is that‚Äôs very inefficient and wasteful on anything it does. For example Trump built a wall and spent billions of dollars on the wall, just for a new president (biden) to come in and stop it all. Billions of American dollars wasted. This is just one example and there are countless other initiative that has been canceled and billions wasted.   
 

Our political system is very flaw as well. In the military if you run around saying fuck the commander, they will literally put you in jail. At a company if you work for one and ran around saying fuck the CEO, you will more than likely get fired. But in America, our government (which is basically a big business), you feel you are free because you can run around and say fuck the president. 

Quick history lesson, China and India back the 1700s was the richest countries on the planet, China and India only fell on the world stage because of European colonization. The European nations (Brits, spain, France etc) with their new found army with powerful guns ran around and colonized and conquered half the earth. This is why a lot of non western country is so poor or was poor, it‚Äôs because of the colonization.  
 

But fast forward to 2022, wars are fought differently, countries have nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are so devastating, the ones we have now makes Hiroshima and Nagasaki the ones dropped in world war 2 look like miniature bombs. So war is fought based on economics and world influence, which china is winning at an astounding rate. As china continue to keep getting richer and more powerful, they will surpass the USA and I believe they will hold this power for the next 1000 years.",America is a declining super power,1.0,1,zydzt4,Lazy_Mechanic558,0,2022-12-29 19:29:12,1672342170,1672342170,2022-12-29,19:29:12

Secondly, the grandmother is used to cash and may be unfamiliar with smart phones let alone crypto.

On the other hand, the savings using BTC may have a very significant effect on lifestyle and one grandmother in a village using BTC who suddenly has money left over at the end of the month may have a big effect on her friends and may cause a ""mass conversion.""

I also wonder how the remitter in for example the United States is able to convert the money into BTC with low-enough fees to justify using BTC instead of WU and besides the conversion fees, does one face problems on an exchange do regular transactions?

I just started working on [documenso.com](https://documenso.com), an open-source DocuSign alternative. I'm currently thinking about what use cases to offer besides the ones already offered by most players.

One Bitcoin-related idea was this: Document Signing uses hashes to ensure document integrity after signing. It would be possible to persist these hashes on the bitcoin blockchain for a new type of ""ultra-secure"" signing transactions since the BTC chain is 100% not manipulated.

Would you see any value in that? Also: Do you see that as a misuse of BTC infrastructure?

Do you think we will see smart contracts on the second layers of Bitcoin in the future and how do you think this will change the industry?   


I think it's likely that we will see smart contracts on second layers on Bitcoin in the future. This could be very revolutionary for the industry as it would enable users to create and execute contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain without clogging up the main blockchain. It would also allow users to create applications with more complex logic and transactions than are currently possible. In addition, it could open up the possibility for users to create and deploy decentralized applications (dapps) on the Bitcoin network. This could have a major impact on the industry as it could increase the utility of Bitcoin and potentially make it more attractive to a wider range of users.

Bitcoin,"I should preface this post by letting folks know that I am not a coder. That said however my concerns are that when newer versions of Bitcoin Core comes out you see bug fixes etc from the previous version but also there are occasionally changes to the rules of consensus. This essentially means that if you ""upgrade"" to the latest version, you effectively vote for that new rules of consensus from your version of what previously you voted bitcoin was. 

IMO there should be a differenent approach here. When bugs are found, why not update the older versions as well without touching the rules of consensus in said older versions?  You could still have the original versions available for reference however this approach would keep the bitcoin network safer and more robust while continuing to allow the individual node operators to decide what version of bitcoin is the true bitcoin which is the whole point! (aka decentralization) 

For example, I'm not a fan of Taro (or taproot in general for that matter) in the bitcoin protocol so I don't run bitcoin core beyond a certain version. Unfortunately these versions have apparently since had bugs reported and remedied by later versions.  That said my concern there is that eventually my versions may have fatal bugs uncovered and the only way to keep bitcoin running is to upgrade to something that I would consider to be true bitcoin.

Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Bitcoin,"Forgive my mediocre computer knowledge, last night the initial synchronization was estimated to be complete in under 48 hours which seemed reasonable. Now the progress has slowed to .01%/hour with an estimated completion time of \~1 year on the high end. Obviously not willing to wait a whole year to set this thing up so I've been trying to troubleshoot with no luck so far. I read that it is common for the synch to slow down once the blocks started getting filled with more information but would like to optimize settings on my end to get this thing moving. I intend to dedicate this laptop to running the node 24/7. 

&amp;#x200B;

Computer is a Windows with 4GB RAM and limited internal storage so I connected an external 1 TB HD (not SSD). The HD specs say capable of 150 MB/s read and write but task manager is showing 2.5 MB/s (. Because the laptop is reasonably capable (I was using it every day until recently) I suspect that the external drive connection is serving as an information chokepoint but am not sure how to resolve it. It's plugged in to a USB 3.0 port, assuming it's a 3.0 cable since I didn't verify. Computer connected to WiFi at 65 Mbps. 

&amp;#x200B;

I read that an SSD will improve the synch speed, however the SSD I have on hand is too small. Could I buy one, yes but I also just blew a ton of money on Christmas stuff and I really don't want to if it can be helped. In a similar vein, I also don't want to change the RAM/CPU hardware since this is going to be a dedicated node.

&amp;#x200B;

Also read that increasing the database cache can help, I went from 450 to 1,000 and restarted the synch, looks like I may have marginally increased the MB/s to the external drive. Unsure how high I can increase without crashing the computer with only 4 GB RAM. Looks like I have \~800 MB of available memory at any given time and the program is using \~250 MB. Will increasing the DB Cache continue to provide an increase in synch speed or have I hit the point of diminishing returns if the program uses less memory than I've allocated for it? Currently using almost 90% of the RAM according to the task manager. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading my novel... I've been typing and troubleshooting at the same time. Take it easy on me, I'm a blue collar guy trying to become more technologically literate.

- It costs money for everything!  Want to buy it?  There's a fee.  Want to use it?  There's a fee.  This is a massive disadvantage to using USD as once you have USD, there's no fees to use it.
- It's slow AF.  Even when using the lightning network.  When I paid for my groceries yesterday, it took so much longer than using my visa card or cash.  The checkout lady basically gave me death stares, I held up the line and the transaction took ages.  Then she had to put in some code.  Which she got from a book.  Did I mention it took ages.

Bitcoin," 

Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses a peer-to-peer network to facilitate transactions and validate them through a process called mining. It was designed to be a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies, which are controlled by central banks and governments.

However, over the years, there have been concerns about the increasing centralization of the Bitcoin network. Here are a few reasons why some people believe that Bitcoin is becoming more centralized:

1. Concentration of mining power: A small number of mining pools, which are groups of miners that combine their computing power to increase their chances of finding a block, have a significant proportion of the total mining power on the network. This concentration of mining power could potentially allow these pools to manipulate the network and make it more difficult for smaller miners to compete.
2. Influence of large exchanges: A small number of large exchanges, such as Coinbase and Binance, dominate the market for buying and selling Bitcoin. These exchanges have significant control over the price of Bitcoin and can potentially manipulate the market to their advantage.
3. Dependence on a few key players: Some key infrastructure providers, such as Bitmain and Blockstream, have a significant influence on the direction of the Bitcoin network. These companies control important aspects of the network, such as the development of the protocol and the operation of key infrastructure, which could give them disproportionate power over the network.
4. Limited number of nodes: While the Bitcoin network has a large number of nodes, a significant proportion of these nodes are run by a small number of organizations. This could make it easier for these organizations to coordinate and potentially exert control over the network.

Overall, while Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized cryptocurrency, there are concerns that it is becoming more centralized as the network has grown. This centralization could potentially undermine the decentralized nature of the network and lead to more centralized control over the network.",bitcoin being centralised,1.0,1,zxd5n4,lilcutie_677,0,2022-12-28 15:59:27,1672243186,1672243187,2022-12-28,15:59:27

Bitcoin,"
Hi everyone,

As a long-time Bitcoin enthusiast, I'm always looking for new and innovative ways to use Bitcoin in my everyday life. Here are a few examples of how I've been able to incorporate Bitcoin into my daily routine:

Paying for coffee: Many coffee shops and cafes now accept Bitcoin as a payment method, so I often use it to pay for my daily caffeine fix.

Sending money abroad: Bitcoin makes it easy to send money to anyone, anywhere in the world, without the need for intermediaries or high fees. I've used it to send money to friends and family overseas multiple times.

Investing: Bitcoin can be a great investment opportunity, and I've used it to diversify my portfolio and potentially earn some passive income.

Online shopping: More and more online merchants are starting to accept Bitcoin, making it a convenient and secure way to shop online.

Donating to charities: Bitcoin allows for fast and easy donations to charities, without the need for traditional payment methods or fees.

I hope these examples give you some ideas for how you can use Bitcoin in your everyday life. Do you have any other examples to share?

So I‚Äôve noticed a strong trend developing of people asking quite legitimate questions of BTCs future and that of wider crypto, only to be met back with half baked platitudes, that those of us in the community have heard many times before. Despite this, there are some serious questions that the BTC community need to consider. I‚Äôve detailed below a series of real life (not technical) issues that face BTC. If anyone can respond to them with genuine logical responses then please do so. If you feel compelled to reply with something like, ‚Äòthis is fud‚Äô or ‚Äòyour comment is a buy signal‚Äô or ‚Äòwe have seen this all before‚Äô then just pop your self back in the poorly informed box from which you came. 

1. This time ‚Äòis‚Äô different. BTC has never witnessed a macro economic environment like this before. This is a fact. BTC performed as a ‚Äòrisk on asset‚Äô only and is strongly correlated with the likes of the NSDQ. In an environment that may see major indexes like the S&amp;P, Dow, NSDQ fail to return ATH across a 10/15yr period, what would this mean for BTC? 

2. The ‚Äòinstitutions‚Äô are not coming. BTC took 10yrs to attract a comparatively slight level of institutional interest. Following significant issues around ESG compliance, repeated frauds and scams ala Tera and FTX etc as well as a lack of regulation, it is likely that institutions will struggle to regain any foothold within the space ever again. 

3. ‚ÄòWe have seen this all before, Mt Gox etc‚Äô No we haven‚Äôt. Never before has so much been lost by so many, in an environment that was already being lined up as a target by regulators. The core argument here being that the actions of a few ‚Äòcrypto‚Äô bros have likely damaged the space so irrevocably that the coming regulation is likely to be punitive in the extreme. For retail it is highly likely that regulators will seek to control all on and off ramps making it near impossible to own or realise any gains. For institutions it is likely that the regulation will be designed to limit / prevent adoption. There will be no ETF, ever. 

4. Energy usage is an issue regardless of the facts of environmental impact. The energy price is not stabilising and is highly unlikely to do so under the current geopolitical conditions. This is now leading to a declining hash rate. This combined with little price action will lead to stagnation. 

5. What‚Äôs the narrative? As much as the maxis believe in the BTC gospel of freedoms and pharmaceutical grade money (I count my self within this) the only thing that has brought new people to the space is price speculation. With the above being true and the potential for little positive price action across a significant timeframe, what is the narrative that would bring new people to this space?",Let's talk about this,1.0,1,zx83yl,cryptoleader01,0,2022-12-28 12:14:31,1672229684,1672229685,2022-12-28,12:14:31

Now if you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25 I wouldn‚Äôt take it because what would I do with it? I‚Äôd have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn‚Äôt going to do anything. The apartments are going to produce rent and the farms are going to produce food.‚Äù

he gets a lot of grief for being an old man yelling at clouds, but he's absolutely right here. owning all the bitcoin in the world would be like being the only person to have an email address, or a linkedin account. theres no one you could talk to. no one you could trade with

forget the dollar price of btc, its irrelevent. what matters - how many people have a btc wallet and how many know how to use it and value it enough that they would sell you a sandwich. if this number isnt going up and you keep stacking sats as an investment youre just buying a bigger share of nothing, this experiment will fail and the bubble will burst eventually. bitcoin's a lousy investment asset because it doesnt produce anything, it could be a good money one day, but thats up to us",stacking sats and hodl - counterproductive and almost pointless,1.0,1,zwyopf,Zealousideal_Key520,0,2022-12-28 03:11:58,1672197131,1672197132,2022-12-28,03:11:58

Bitcoin,"So I‚Äôve noticed a strong trend developing of people asking quite legitimate questions of BTCs future and that of wider crypto, only to be met back with half baked platitudes, that those of us in the community have heard many times before. Despite this, there are some serious questions that the BTC community need to consider. I‚Äôve detailed below a series of real life (not technical) issues that face BTC. If anyone can respond to them with genuine logical responses then please do so. If you feel compelled to reply with something like, ‚Äòthis is fud‚Äô or ‚Äòyour comment is a buy signal‚Äô then just pop your self back in the poorly informed box from which you came. 

1. This time ‚Äòis‚Äô different. BTC has never witnessed a macro economic environment like this before. This is a fact. BTC performed as a ‚Äòrisk on asset‚Äô only and is strongly correlated with the likes of the NSDQ. In an environment that may see major indexes like the S&amp;P, Dow, NSDQ fail to return ATH across a 10/15yr period, what would this mean for BTC? 

2. The ‚Äòinstitutions‚Äô are not coming. BTC took 10yrs to attract a comparatively slight level of institutional interest. Following significant issues around ESG compliance, repeated frauds and scams ala Tera and FTX etc as well as a lack of regulation, it is likely that institutions will struggle to regain any foothold within the space ever again. 

3. ‚ÄòWe have seen this all before, Mt Gox etc‚Äô No we haven‚Äôt. Never before has so much been lost by so many, in an environment that was already being lined up as a target by regulators. The core argument here being that the actions of a few ‚Äòcrypto‚Äô bros have likely damaged the space so irrevocably that the coming regulation is likely to be punitive in the extreme. For retail it is highly likely that regulators will seek to control all on and off ramps making it near impossible to own or realise any gains. For institutions it is likely that the regulation will be designed to limit / prevent adoption. There will be no ETF, ever. 

4. Energy usage is an issue regardless of the facts of environmental impact. The energy price is not stabilising and is highly unlikely to do so under the current geopolitical conditions. This is now leading to a declining hash rate. This combined with little price action will lead to stagnation. 

5. What‚Äôs the narrative? As much as the maxis believe in the BTC gospel of freedoms and pharmaceutical grade money the nly thing that has brought new people to the space is price speculation. With the above being true and the potential for little positive price action across a significant timeframe, what is the narrative that would bring new people to this space?",Time for an grown up conversation,1.0,1,zwv64s,Plus-Ad1544,0,2022-12-28 00:29:08,1672187359,1672187359,2022-12-28,00:29:08

Here is a new technology, that not everyone understands. The experts in the field think it's astonishing and the uneducated think it's worthless.

This new technology is being used, replicated, copied, hacked, tested, run through the media, etc. It's over a decade like that and in that time everyone who knows the word bitcoin can be devided into two groups. Those that believe in it and think it's the future and major descovery, and those who think it's a fad or a Ponzi scheme, or a bubble. 

Yet, everyone who genuinely understands it is in the group that believes in it. Leaving the group that doesn't believe entirely made up of speculators who also don't understand it.

Well the price is a see-saw and when the group of sceptics smell a quick buck you run to the other side then when you realise you don't know what your doing you run back. As you're the largest group by far that has a huge amount of movement in the price. Meanwhile that growing influx of people to the understand side have done there job of propping up one side of the seesaw. It was worthless, then it was a cent, then a dollar, then ten, then one hundred, then one thousand, now it's at ten thousand and more.

In June  2021, when the cryptocurrency markets were soaring, the developers of  the Arte condominium in Miami‚Äôs Surfside neighborhood announced that a  buyer had purchased a penthouse there for $22.5 million in  cryptocurrency. The deal, one of the most expensive ever done using  digital coins, was heralded as evidence that cryptocurrency would  eventually become commonplace in the real-estate world.

Bitcoin,"Good morning, I've been in Bitcoin for less than two years so I just don't know enough to discuss some topics but I wanted to make a statement about how privacy is KEY to Bitcoin success.

Bitcoin is meant to be a form of electronic cash sent between peers, its main goal is to grant people a way of exiting the FIAT system (at least partially) and in order to do so Bitcoin needs to be antifragile, but bitcoiners need to be like that too cause there is no Bitcoin without bitcoiners.

You can make sure nobody is taking your BTC away by taking your coins into self-custody. And that's true but MANY people who have been on the space for much longer assure that having your keys its already enough. I strongly disagree with that, you need PRIVACY to be antifragile, if your coins are KYCd you are an easy target for anybody with enough knowledge to trace you (government included).

Many think nobody is going to take the time to trace you in that way, well I think they will as soon as you do something they find disturbing enough (and Bitcoin success is something they will find so very disturbing)

I can't express properly how important a good privacy is for a bitcoiner and I am so worried that the main voices in the space usually just don't care about it cause ""you only need privacy if you are doing something wrong"" first of all that's a lie and secondly well who says what's wrong.

1. Connect the network cable with the miner¬†through the router.

2. Connect the power and start the machine.

(Within several¬†minutes¬†of starting up, there will be a warm-up stage of the miner, and the miner will start running with a large noise¬†after a while).

When the miner is connected to the router, you can find it by searching the¬†new¬†network address¬†added from the router background.

### Set up your ASIC miner

If you are on the same LAN with only one miner, then you could type your IP address¬†directly into your browser and display the login page, the default username: root, and the default password: root.

My average ppm taken for forwarding payments has been steadily rising in December. This is not because I‚Äôve changed my fee schedule, but rather because more and more traffic can flow to heavy sinks, as my rebalancing is getting better.

As I am not using and standard plugins, I must write my own tools.It took me till the start of October to get my Rebalancer to a point where it uses less fees than it earns. Since then, I have made steady progress towards better rebalancing. But there are the occasional bugs in my code (see the negative spike in December) that ruin my days

Bitcoin,"As the world becomes increasingly digital, it's no surprise that the demand for virtual currencies like Bitcoin is skyrocketing. And with the recent news of major companies publicly backing Bitcoin, it's clear that this trend is only going to continue.

But let's be real: the skyrocketing price of Bitcoin isn't just a passing fad. It's a sign of the times, and a testament to the bright future that lies ahead for this revolutionary digital currency.

You see, Bitcoin is more than just a means of exchange. It's a symbol of the changing financial landscape, a beacon of hope for a more decentralized and equitable world. And as more and more people catch on to the benefits of Bitcoin, it's only natural that the price will continue to rise.

But it's not just about the price. Bitcoin is also a powerful tool for financial freedom, allowing individuals to take control of their own wealth and transact without the interference of banks or governments. And as the global economy becomes increasingly unstable, it's clear that Bitcoin is the safe haven that people are turning to.

So don't be fooled by the naysayers and doubters. The future of Bitcoin is bright, and the price will only continue to climb higher and higher. Get in while you still can, because this train is only just getting started.",Light on Bitcoins future,1.0,1,zvh3kk,Finaldecade,0,2022-12-26 06:40:10,1672036825,1672036825,2022-12-26,06:40:10

Bitcoin," If you are experiencing panic right now, you wouldn't have held bitcoin if you had bought it at pennies in 2009.

The technology behind BTC has only improved from a year ago. If you believe in bitcoin and decentralization, you should not be selling. There have been many bearish periods throughout the years that in hindsight was a great time to buy and hold.

Ôøº(Kitco News) -¬†Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has asked a U.S. court to freeze former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs $441 million worth of Robinhood shares after bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi made a claim on them.

BlockFi was one of the first victims of the ongoing contagion in the crypto ecosystem that was unleashed in the wake of the Nov. 11 bankruptcies of FTX and hedge fund Alameda Research. BlockFi¬†announced¬†that they had ‚Äúsignificant exposure‚Äù to FTX, including ‚Äúobligations owed to us by Alameda, assets held at FTX.com, and undrawn amounts from our credit line with FTX.US,‚Äù and the company was forced to declare its own bankruptcy on Nov. 28.

Last month, the crypto lender filed a¬†motion¬†to sue Emergent Fidelity Technologies, a company owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, for the 56 million shares of Robinhood it held, arguing that Alameda had pledged the stock to back $680 million in loans promised to BlockFi.

‚ÄúBlockFi is entitled to use and possession of the Collateral under the Pledge Agreement because Emergent defaulted on its obligations thereunder and failed to cure the default,‚Äù they wrote in the motion. ‚ÄúThe Collateral is property of the BlockFi bankruptcy estates and is valuable and beneficial to the BlockFi bankruptcy estates.‚Äù

On Thursday, FTX filed its own¬†motion, which revealed that there are at least three competing claims on the Robinhood shares, including one from SBF himself. ‚ÄúSince the commencement of these chapter 11 cases, three different competing stakeholders of the Debtors have filed court actions in different jurisdictions to gain control of the Robinhood Shares to collect on claims against the Debtors,‚Äù including BlockFi, a creditor of FTX Trading named Yonathan Ben Shimon, ‚Äúand Mr. Bankman-Fried himself (who has repeatedly sought a source of payment for legal expenses).‚Äù

FTX wrote that their investigation ‚Äúindicates that the Robinhood Shares are property of the Debtors‚Äô estates, held only nominally by Emergent,‚Äù and they have asked the US bankruptcy court in Delaware for an automatic stay on the stock until these competing claims are formally resolved.

The motion states that ‚Äújust two days before the Debtors (including FTX Trading and Alameda) filed for bankruptcy, BlockFi scrambled to protect itself from impending losses on antecedent loans by threatening to seek remedies against Alameda‚Äù if the hedge fund didn‚Äôt pledge additional collateral to back their loan commitments to them.

‚ÄúIn response to those threats, and despite the perilous financial of Alameda and the other Debtors, Alameda‚Äôs then-CEO Caroline Ellison, with knowledge and encouragement from Mr. Bankman-Fried, purportedly agreed to pledge over $1 billion worth of additional Alameda assets,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúThe Robinhood Shares were included in these pledged assets by Alameda‚Äôs then-CEO, despite the fact that the Robinhood Shares were nominally held by Emergent, because Alameda had then, and continues to have, a property interest in the Robinhood Shares.‚Äù

Robinhood stock is trading at $7.88 at the time of writing, making the total value of the stake in question approximately $441.3 million. A hearing on the motion by FTX has not yet been scheduled.",FTX wants Robinhood shares frozen.,1.0,1,zukf21,paladin68,0,2022-12-24 22:29:03,1671920957,1671920958,2022-12-24,22:29:03

Having Bitcoin in self-custody is kind of like having cash stashed in your house, or more appropriately having gold coins hidden in a vault buried in a secret location that only you know about. The difference with Bitcoins in self-custody is that it is even more secure than physical cash or gold.

Scammers, fraudsters and enemies of Bitcoin are constantly trying to convince you that taking custody of your Bitcoin is too hard.

**This is a lie. Do NOT believe them.**

## Bitcoin self-custody: it‚Äôs easier than you think!

Custodial services can restrict access to your money, freeze or seize your funds, they keep your transaction data, they are targets for hackers, and honey pots for hostile government agencies. Using custodial services defeats the entire purpose of Bitcoin.

Your Bitcoin journey begins with downloading a mobile or desktop application called a Bitcoin wallet.¬†**It only takes a few minutes, it‚Äôs free, it‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs secure and it‚Äôs easy.**

Your Bitcoin wallet will be your gateway to the Bitcoin network. It will allow you to send &amp; receive funds, and monitor your transactions &amp; account balances. You do not need permission from anyone to send or receive payments.¬†

They can be used both for secure long-term savings or convenient day-to-day transactions.

Bitcoin,"The link I have shared as part of this post really made me stop and think today. It's an estimate of listening and non-listening bitcoin node.

If you consider yourself a Bitcoiner, this should worry you. What you see is a slow decay of a statistic that should be growing year on year. Especially now, when people are moving to self custody, as the shitcoins die, and when people are seeing the true value of Bitcoin as a tool of freedom.

The misconception about running a node is that you are supporting the network. But it's not really about that. Running a node is YOU exerting control. It's YOU saying ""these are my rules, THIS is what I want Bitcoin to be"". And if many users engage this selfish act, Bitcoin becomes stronger! That's the magic right there.

Look at the blocksize wars, at the big blocker corporate interests signalling for segwit2x, look at the RBF nonsense as people who don't understand the risks and function of Bitcoin try to dictate how the network should work. Node runners are the main line of defense against these actors. YOU can be there in the phalanx, in fact you SHOULD be there, with a spear in hand ready to strike at that which you must fight. A shield locked with those you would share concensus with.

If you do not run a Bitcoin node you are allowing the essence of bitcoin to rot through inaction. For your sake, for the sake of your bitcoin and, critically, for the sake of Bitcoin's soul. Run a node.

You don't need a raspberry pi, you don't need an old computer, you don't need to run Linux or make a sever or any of that shit. What you need is to download bitcoin core from [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/) for your OS, verify it, and install it. Congratulations. You now operate a node. If you can't spare the disk space?Prune it. Can't dedicate the bandwidth? Don't propagate blocks. Don't want people to know you use bitcoin? Enable tor. The possible configurations are huge and there are [tools to help you configure it as well](https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/). Wallets like sparrow will easily connect to your node too, so you can effortlessly have privacy in your transactions too.

Aren't sure what you are doing? Don't worry, ask for help here, go to the daily thread, go to the /r/bitcoin discord. Ask. Ask. Ask. People will help you. And then, one day, pay it forward. I have included some helpful links to get you going. But if you are new to this whole thing and have questions then please ask away.

Bitcoin,"A  major change in crypto-tax regulations is going to be approved in  Italy, it is a matter of days. These are the most important  introductions:

* A **0.2% yearly property tax** on the whole amount of crypto owned;
* A confirmation of a **26% capital gain tax** on trades;
* **Conversions between different cryptos does not generate relevant capital gain**, capital gain must be calculated when a cycle of fiat-crypto-fiat conversion happen;
* People  who never declared to own crypto before 2023 can execute a voluntary  disclosure and pay 14% of the value and everything is ok.

The  law was written in a very little amount of time in order to be approved  by the end of 2022. A lot of questions have no answer at this point, in  particular:

* The law is not clear regarding how to evaluate the amount of crypto owned;
* The subsequent Italian tense is really alarming:

&gt;Si  considera cessione a titolo oneroso anche il trasferimento di \[...\]  cripto-attivit√† \[...\] a rapporti di custodia o amministrazione \[...\],  intestati a soggetti diversi dagli intestatari del rapporto di  provenienza

That  seems to mean, more or less, that if you move your btc to a custodial  service (an exchange?), it is the same as if you sold them. That means, an  Italian citizen risks to pay 26% capital gain taxes just by moving their coins on an exchange.

Bitcoin,"You might have come across Nostr for the first time when Elon Musk banned links to other platforms on Twitter, inadvertently publicising Nostr. But just what is Nostr? I wrote this primarily for myself and would be happy if my notes help you as well. These are six basic things about this revolutionary innovation: 

1. Nostr stands for Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays. According to GitHub, it is described as ‚Äúa truly censorship-resistant alternative to Twitter that has a chance of working‚Äù. (https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr)

2. Fun fact: the co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, donated about 14 BTC to fund and facilitate Nostr‚Äôs development. (https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/15/jack-dorsey-gives-decentralized-social-network-nostr-14-btc-in-funding/)

3. Nostr is different from Twitter in the sense that it is decentralised. Rather than depending on a centralised server, all Nostr users run their own client. This client enables one to publish content by writing something, signing it with their private key and transmitting it to other clients which relay this content. All relays are permission-less.

4. If you are keen to try Nostr out for yourself, this might be a helpful resource: https://github.com/vishalxl/nostr_console/discussions/31

5. Some popular clients that you might want to check out include Astral (https://astral.ninja/) and Anigma (https://anigma.io/)

What is it? A protocol for sharing short messages that uses key pairing similar to bitcoin.  Built by bitcoin developers - bitcoin lightning payments are native across the system and are the incentive structure to the various components.

Users generate a key pair, public key is essentially your username, private key your password. When a user wants to do something (post, like, follow, share, etc) they publish a short message signed by their key to as many relays as they want (can also host their own relay).

Users can use a client (see link at top for list of clients and how they feel) to specify relays they would like to query events from - the client will restore their followers, messages, etc from the relays.  Some clients behave like telegram, some like twitter, some like reddit. 

If a client does something you don't like (ads, censorship (they may not render some posts) etc.) Then you move to a new client and use your keys there. all of your data, history, and identity are preserved.

Lightning integrations are already super easy, as the project moves towards beta - likes with be streaming sats to posts, relays may monetize by data mining their users (be free) or you can use a relay that accepts sats for storage.

User: Imagine I'm at hyperbitcoinised future

Model: You're in the hyperbitcoinised future! There are no more fiat currencies. Instead, everyone has cryptocurrencies on their phones that they use to buy things. The government has also been replaced by a blockchain! 

User: what are the people on the street doing?

Model: They're looking at their phones, checking their cryptocurrency balances. Some are tapping their phones to pay for things. There are no more dollar bills. The phone is money! 

User: what does the currency symbol look like?

Model: It looks like a little diamond-shaped green token with a B on it. You're not sure what it's called, but you'll learn later that it is called the Bitcoin! 

User: what do the newspapers say?

Model: The front page of the newspaper is all about the fact that fiat currency has been banned by the government, replaced by the Bitcoin. The headline reads: ""Fiat Currency Banned! Bitcoin is the Only Legal Tender!"" 

User: what's the headline on the second page?

Model: You turn to the second page of the newspaper. There's a small article here about a new app called iMoney. It's like Bitcoin, but you can use it to pay for things at any store, no matter where you are! 

User: how does it work?

Model: It's a little chip that you put under your skin when you're 18 years old. It lets you use iMoney to pay for things just by tapping your phone. You can also transfer money to other people just by tapping their phones.

Bitcoin," 

Anyone  who used the dark web around 2016-17 can attest to this. The dark web  used to be intricate ecosystem of global black markets brought together  in one place. It was like the wild west where anything goes. It had  countless sites. Often large ""everything"" sites like ebay where all the  products and services from global vendors were located in a singular  place. When this was the case bitcoin was the main currency. This is why  it is the most valued crypto in the game. It was traded for an extended  period of time at a volume that will be unmatched because it had a real  use case.

Trading at a high  volume for an extended period of time is the only reason Bitcoin is top  dog. Not due to any fancy tech or any features any other coins haven't  already implemented.

Now the dark  web is practically dead. Sure you can still purchase things with  bitcoin. However, there are barely any remaining sites and it seems like  they get close to zero daily users. They also seem to not be reliable  and get taken down frequently.

Bitcoin  and crypto in general has moved away from providing any real value and  moved towards a get rich quick scheme from greedy investors looking to  pump and dump. There are almost no real use cases anymore for products  and services you can purchase - despite being legal or not.

The  masses have invested in crypto without knowing what actually validated  it's potential. If you are looking for when ""Crypto will recover"" -  watch the dark web. If the dark web can recover with the same anonymity  it was able to provide before prices will sky rocket.

The  real driver of the price is a true use case scenario that the masses  can easily access.  Only the dark web has done this thus far. Only the  dark web will recover crypto's horrible reputation now - kinda funny.",Death of the Dark Web,1.0,1,zs82jt,ComprehensiveGear208,0,2022-12-22 01:27:06,1671672440,1671672441,2022-12-22,01:27:06
Bitcoin,"Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have the potential to revolutionize the financial systems for those who really need it. One reason for this is that many people in these countries do not trust their governments to control their financial systems responsibly.

In many countries the level of corruption is high and resources are often times mismanaged, cryptocurrencies offer an alternative way to store and transfer value. Because of this block chains like bitcoin are decentralized and not controlled by any single entity, thus providing a level of security and transparency that is often lacking.

Additionally, cryptocurrencies can increase financial inclusion in developing countries. Many people in these countries do not have access to traditional banking services, either because they are too expensive or because they are difficult to get. Cryptocurrencies offer a way for these individuals to  participate in the global economy, even if they don't have a bank account.

Finally, the use of cryptocurrencies can also help to reduce the risk of fraud and other financial crimes in developing countries. Because all transactions are recorded on a public ledger, it is much harder for fraudulent activity to go undetected.

Overall, the future of cryptocurrencies in developing countries will be insane.

Bitcoin,"People who say so keep considering pools as a unique entity. While it is true that someone leads the pool, it is wrong to consider all miners to blindly follow regardless of what happens.

Let's consider an attack on the Bitcoin Network of more than 3 blocks reverted :

If a pool leader was to attack, following miners would mine blocks on a hacked blockchain. After a few blocks, the hacked blockchain might become the longest one (difficulty speaking). The hacked chain would get considered as a fork by all honest nodes because it would imply a reorg higher than 3. Honest nodes would automatically discard the hacked chain. The word would spread on all social medias than an attack is going on. Everyone would manually check they are on the good chain. At the same time, miners in the hacking pool would start taking action. No miner would want to mine on a worthless chain, and a majority of miners are honest. Thus, they would quit the pool. The power of the attacking pool would fall dramatically. After that, the fork would not receive enough difficulty mined to keep up with the good chain, and would die.

I think this whole attack cancellation could be put to work in less than a few hours. Plus, the attackers would lose insane amounts of power to mine on a chain that loses in the end. 

Let's remember than the majority of our miners want to make good. If they didn't, we would punish them anyway. So they will never tolerate their mining power to be used by a malicious pool. As soon as a pool is labeled as malicious, it's over.

Bitcoin,"1. The increasing hash rate of the Bitcoin network: The hash rate is a measure of the processing power of the Bitcoin network, and it has been steadily increasing over time. This is an important factor because it helps to secure the network and makes it more resistant to attacks.

2. The halving event: The halving is a programmed reduction in the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated, which occurs approximately every four years. This event is significant because it reduces the supply of new Bitcoins, which can lead to an increase in demand and, in turn, a higher price.

3. Rapid adoption rate: The adoption rate of Bitcoin is often cited as being faster than the adoption rate of the internet in its early days. This suggests that more and more people and businesses are starting to recognize the potential of Bitcoin as a means of payment and store of value.

4. Increasing mainstream acceptance: Bitcoin is becoming increasingly mainstream, with more businesses accepting it as a payment method and more user-friendly platforms and products becoming available.

5. Potential to replace traditional global currencies: There is a growing belief that Bitcoin has the potential to replace traditional global currencies in the next decade due to a waning faith in elite centralized banks and a lack of government accountability. Bitcoin offers certain advantages over traditional currencies, such as its decentralized nature, which makes it resistant to inflation and manipulation by governments or financial institutions.

Overall, these factors suggest that Bitcoin has the potential to continue to rise in value in the coming years. While it is difficult to predict the exact trajectory of any asset, the increasing hash rate, halving event, rapid adoption rate, increasing mainstream acceptance, and the potential for Bitcoin to replace traditional global currencies all contribute to its potential value in 2024.","There are several key factors that suggest that Bitcoin is likely to be valued at over $200,000 in 2024.

The problem is people with significant amounts of capital make it ultra competitive for an everyday household miner to justify the costs and means.

I wish a company would develop a new technology that would be 2-3x efficient and half the wattage, but the key component would be that it would only sell the 2 miners per household as a limit such that corporations and large players couldn't such up all the hash rate.

Then it would make sense for millions of people to have miners and it would distribute the mining across a lot more people who could being in pools anyways, but then it would decentralize mining further.

With Bitcoin, you can finally join the ranks of the cool kids and leave all those boring banks behind. It's decentralized, which means no pesky governments or financial institutions can tell you what to do with your hard-earned money. And the best part? It's got advanced cryptography, which is just a fancy way of saying it's really, really secure... as long as no one figures out how to hack it.

Plus, with its growing acceptance and adoption by merchants and businesses, you can finally use it to buy all those things you've always wanted but couldn't afford, like a single banana or a used sock. How cool is that?

So why wait? Get your hands on some Bitcoin and be the envy of all your normie friends! Just don't forget to hold on tight, because it's known to be a bit of a wild ride.

The piece linked above was written well enough but the bull and bear price predictions are both garbage. 

Nexo has not yet been the subject of extreme Twitter scrutiny (only consistent badgering), nor has there been a significant run on assets. In the event that Nexo had a run on assets (like their peers have suffered) the likelihood of a similarly insolvent outcome should be considered very high. Hopefully Nexo have learned lessons from their peers but who knows. I don‚Äôt wish the outcome of their peers on any organization nor the customers inevitably impacted by insolvency events. Even if Nexo survives such an event, the price of their token could be expected to have sharp downward price action.

If Nexo somehow survives until the next bull market, they‚Äôre in prime position to capture a tremendous amount of non-US retail customers and risk-seeking institutional customers. In this scenario, Nexo token would stand to do extremely well, and would probably lead the rest of the market in surpassing ATHs. 

In short:
I‚Äôm staying away from Nexo and their token so long as a bear market is in play since there‚Äôs a high likelihood of a major negative catalyst.

Bitcoin,"I know it's fun, especially when the price moves up...but telling people how much bitcoin you have is not good. why?

1. Hurts relationships. Jealousy-humans are envious. It will hurt friendships if you become the rich person if everyone else is average/poor. 
2. Hurts income -the thing you are using to acquire more btc. Do not, for the love of all that is holy, tell your boss, even if said boss owns btc, that you own a lot. If you own 10 btc, tell him you own 2.  If bitcoin goes up a lot, he will say ""well Joe doesn't need a raise"". And he will deliver it by saying ""Joe we really need to keep Tammy on and pay her more, you're ok, right""
3. Gives you a false sense of wealth. You start seeing your ledger balance, you stop stacking. You start spending. I should have had 4 rental properties-I did-but I had to give them up, and now I have 2. I decided to blow money on some stupid ass shit and could have kept at least one instead of paying for dinner for a bunch of fake ass freeloaders. Many people I believe will regret that they have 1/2 to 2 btc when they could have easily had 5-10. I believe there is no excuse for anyone in the first world who has a family they can live with to get to 5 coins. 
4. Safety-You are not helping yourself by letting people think you have a valuable asset UNLESS you live in an extremely safe area. Look at la, look at nyc. People getting robbed on the streets. You might be an honest person; many people will steal, hurt, rob, for $10. Imagine what they are willing to do for hundreds of thousands or millions.
5. Keeps you from the big goal. Money is supposed to be spent. For many, money can be: I can retire at 50 instead of 60. For others it can be I can take a job I want versus the job that pays now. It could be a gt3...and for a few, it will be the ability to live life on your own terms. I beg of you: that dumb watch, that fast car, the lavish gifts-they mean NOTHING. Reach for the big goal.
6. Makes you a gambler. For many, I believe we HAVE not seen the real gambling begin in housing, crypto, or the stock market.

Bitcoin,"Hi Bitcoiners!

I am very interested in running a full node and I need quite a bit of help. I'm not a super tech heavy person, but I understand some of the nuances.

So here is the issue I have. I began downloading the timechain, and got to about 15%. At this point the Core client said it would be about 2 weeks before the whole chain would be downloaded. FYI, I plugged in my ethernet chord and this did not help.

My computer specs: 

* 2020 Mac Mini
* 8 GB RAM
* 256 GB Storage

I decided to save the chain to my external hard drive that has 1 TB of storage. It had no problem saving it there until the issue around 15% (I read that this can cause the chain to be stored much more slowly, plus the IBD can go slower when processing power is being used up by other computer functions).

I think I might have a solution. I have two monitors hooked up to my Mac mini 2020. I have concluded that it might be best to buy a 2011 Mac mini (because it has a hard drive that I can remove and replace to something larger, ideally 1 TB of storage). I can then hook my monitor up to the 2011 mac mini, download Core and the timechain, and then hook my monitor back to my original 2020 mac, and allow the 2011 mac to just run as a full node; this would be great to have a UI whenever I want to look at the node and it would have the full 8 GB of ram and TB of storage from the 2011 mac. 

I'm trying my best to keep my 2020 mac clean from large downloads because it's my work and personal computer and given my current storage situation I would only be able to download a third of the chain before I am at capacity. 

&amp;#x200B;

* What do you see as a problem? 
* What do you think would be a better solution? (I've read that raspberry PIs are good, but I don't know how to use it and this 2011 Mac is roughly only 50$ so not too bad for what I want to use it as). 
* Is it better to just download the timechain to my external hard drive on my current mac and wait the two weeks before it's fully downloaded?
* Advice?

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin maxis love the idea of Bitcoin becoming a widely used as a ‚Äúdeflationary currency‚Äù, and it is often compared to gold as a store of value. Let‚Äôs look at the history of the gold standard as a comparison - specifically the departure from the gold standard. 

Leading up to and after WWII, the gold standard was swapped for the Bretton Woods System until it was erased by Nixon in the early 70‚Äôs. Executive order 6102, enacted under FDR, required all Americans to submit their gold to the Federal Reserve Bank. After the war, the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement signified a change in the global system, in which all countries in the agreement were required to ‚Äúguarantee convertibility of their currencies into U.S Dollars‚Ä¶ with the dollar convertible to gold bullion for foreign governments and central banks at $35 per troy oz‚Äù (wikipedia). This means all countries exchange for U.S dollars backed by redeemable gold, but that gold is only redeemable by banks and governments, not your average citizen. 

Now my question is highly theortecial: what if the U.S. enacted a similar order for Bitcoin in the wake of a collapsing global market, and it was made illegal for citizens to hold bitcoin. The government pinning the value of the dollar at a certain number of satoshis. There would be a branch of the federal reserve devoted to mining, rogue mining operations would be highly illegal, and other countries would compete for maximum mining outputs. This would have dramatic effects on the development of the cryptocurrency industry, and on the world. There would be many negatives and positives. What do you think?

For the rare gems here who do use it according to Satoshi's vision, what security measures do you take? 

My first thought is about having completely separate HODL stack and SPEND stack. Since transactions are transparent and traceable, it would make sense to keep your savings separate from the coins you spend as to not become a target. For the most paranoid of us, even using different exchanges for each usecase could be, imho, a good idea. This lets you spend your sats safely, and allows you to HODL or sell when necessary, without exposing yourself.

Bitcoin,"A big part of Bitcoin participation is awareness. As a protocol participant, as a node runner ([PLEASE LEARN HOW TO RUN YOUR OWN NODE](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node)), in order to express you sovereignty and secure your Bitcoin activity you need to be aware of what's going on in the ecosystem.

One of the best ways to keep informed about Bitcoin proposals is the [BIP list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). Learning how to read and interpret these documents is critical to understanding how Bitcoin works. You don't need to know everything, the abstracts are very readable without foreknowledge. Consider them extensions of the whitepaper that provide actual specification. Keep in mind all BIPs aren't good. You decide what's good. Not all BIPs are implemented, in fact most are rejected. Learning how and why is also instructive. 

Excellent sources of information are the dev mailing lists and repos themselves. There's the [Bitcoin protocol development mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/), there is the [Core Bitcoin node dev list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-core-dev/), there is the [lightning dev list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/), and there are a few others as well for various implementations. There is also the [Core repo](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues) itself. These are great sources of primary discussion between devs. I'd ask you consider reading and understanding, these are high signal to noise ratio spaces and not social media. The content appropriate there is not the same as the content appropriate here. Please keep contributions substantive.

Every Wednesday there is a new [Optech Newsletter](https://bitcoinops.org/) which attempts to summarize developer discussions on the mailing list. This is an excellent resource for those without the time or attention to parse the full mailing list.

Also on Wednesdays are the community [Bitcoin PR review clubs](https://bitcoincore.reviews/). These are an *excellent* way to become versed in how Bitcoin core development works and get involved in either developing yourself, or grow your comprehension of what is going on in Bitcoin repositories.

If you aren't running a node, if you aren't ready to dive this deep, you can still start your dive at your own pace and make your way down using [lists of community curated resources.](https://lopp.net/bitcoin.html) There is [one for lightning too.](https://lopp.net/lightning.html)

Bitcoin,"TLDR: Let's have a discussion regarding the trend in price **volatility** (not price) for BTC and ware its heading. I would like to see some good analysis on this.

BTC has been the best performing asset in modern history but this has come with volatility like no other.

This volatility, while it lasts, is very much a once in a lifetime opportunity for those who can buy and hold over the long term, even if they don't ""time the market"" particularly well (but better if they do!).

That said it's my understanding that volatility is (generally) decreasing year by year. While this is generally regarded as a good thing for increasing the adoption rate of BTC it also means that the ""oportunity"" presented by said volatility will lesson over time.

We see a lot of price projections (during the bull runs at least) but I don't see many volatility projections. 

Yesterday I was playing around with the simple annual percentage growths on chart and adding a trend line.

I'm not going to post it here because I didn't keep the results and I wouldn't consider my method to be particularly savey ... it was all very rudimentary and not anything I would hang any credibility on. 

I simply observed that, yes, volatility is decreasing and therefore the expected **rate** of annual growth would also likley decrease going forward.

This doesn't mean that BTC isn't still an amazing investment oportunity in addition to all its other societal benifits - monetary freedom, store of value, etc.

But it does mean our growth expectations shouldn't be **AS** high as we observed in the last three halving cycles. 

I say ""expectations"" because there are always external factors (disasters, wars, new tech) that can affect short term price in iether direction.

If they kept this up for a few years, it would stifle the network and no one would want to use it.  Because you'd have to compete with those high fees, which are artificially driven up by governmental action.  

It really seems to me, that this could be the MOST effective way for the government to attack Bitcoin.  With just a couple billion $ (which is a drop in the bucket for the US govt, hell Powell could crank that out in a keystroke), they could make EVERY fee for an entire year be $5 (more likely FAR higher).  

Seriously.  7 transactions/second = about 221 million/year.  So for a little over a billion $, they could make the fees be at least $5 on each transaction.  Making it prohibitively expensive to use the network for any small transactions.

I decided to make a quick draw (don't judge it) because I would like to clarify something where I'm not sure at all...  
I'm buying BTC every week since few months and due to my KYC, Binance knows where my BTC is going and also that this Ledger is mine (As I whitelisted the address and I'm using the since to send my BTC). **This is A**

**For B :** If my friend Tom wants to send me some BTC and I create a second wallet on my Ledger, can the state know that the second address created on Ledger is linked to my first?   


Do I have to use a VPN or something to ""hide"" the BTC that the can send me directly to avoid that it ends up with BTC ""traced"" by Binance and the State. 

I ask those questions because I have one (or more customers) who would like to pay me in Bitcoin. I am a self-employed (and ""young"") art and furniture dealer so I really want to protect myself in the long term.

Bitcoin,"I'm trying to understand some things about Bitcoin, and I've been searching for 2 days, watching videos, reading articles... None of them have explained it to my absolute understanding. It's frustrating.

Question 1 (Transaction Inputs):

Where EXACTLY do the inputs come from? I learnt they are UTXO's (Unspent Transaction Outputs) from previous transactions. Which transactions, and to whom? Does every payment that comes to me generate a new UTXO? So for example, if 3 people have recently sent me BTC (to a single address I own), do I have 3 separate UTXO's to spend (use as inputs for *my* next transaction)?

That was my reasoning, and it seemed to be making sense, until I came across info that said the inputs can come from different addresses. Huh? Okay... Looks like they have a point though, because when I check the block explorer for transactions, I actually see distinct ADDRESSES as inputs and outputs. It should mean that every address can rather only have one UTXO at a time, right? And multiple UTXO's should definitely come from different addresses. But if multiple addresses are used as inputs, shouldn't all of them be owned by the sender? Because only the sender should authorise a transaction.

Now if that's the case, how is that done? Because with the wallets I've used (Trust and Binance), I don't see an option to select multiple addresses I own and combine their value when I'm sending BTC. So... What's happening? Can multiple inputs only be achieved using low level coding or something? When I search for ""How to send Bitcoin from multiple addresses"" or similar, I don't find *anything* that answers my question. It's as if that's not possible. I'm just not getting it. For the outputs, I understand. But the inputs haven't really been explained to me.

Can someone who understands this from A to Z spell it out for me without leaving anything out? I'd be really grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 2 (Block confirmations and reversibility):

Many sources say that transactions that have 6 or more confirmations can be considered ""irreversible"". Okay, logically, that should mean that with less than 6 confirmations, the transaction *can* be reversed.

Now, what I know about block confirmations is that it's the number of blocks that have been added to the blockchain *after* the one that contains the transaction in question. So that means even with one or two confirmations, the block *is* actually on the public blockchain, right? So if the transaction can be reversed, how is that done? Will it be pulled down from the blockchain? (funny question). What would happen to the 1-5 blocks after it? Meanwhile if you search for ""Can bitcoin transactions be reversed?"", all the answers you get are ""No."" So what's really the point here?",I have 2 BIG questions about Bitcoin transactions.,1.0,1,zql2gk,XOR_dinary,0,2022-12-20 10:31:16,1671532292,1671532292,2022-12-20,10:31:16

I believe Benjamin Franklin said these words. So my question is how much longer can people keep Satoshi's identity a secret? Unless he has never revealed his it to anyone, but is that even possible?

* What attracted you to buy Bitcoin?

Bitcoin,"Do I have the following correct in this hypothetical future?

1. Bitcoin is the medium of exchange and store of value in a country.
2. The vast majority of people just save money since there is no more government-induced inflation. Prices of all goods are relatively stable except in natural disaster situations and supply chain fluctuations.
3. The financial investment industry has shrunk exponentially. There are still people who are investors and provide this expertise for a fee or commission.
4. It is extremely transparent where each Satoshi of your taxes go to. Public entitlement programs are very limited and completely funded as the money supply is almost 100% predictable now. Publicly funded pensions are almost unheard of. There are a lot more private companies providing what were once largely publicly funded services such as public safety.
5. Banks still exist but their business model is more about pooling investor funds and providing a Bitcoin custody service for the people who don't feel comfortable holding their own coins. Bitcoin custodial services are a big deal as personal home robberies are now fairly commonplace. Banks are not required to have a 1:1 reserve ratio, but customers understand that if a bank does not then they may lose their money if something happens to the bank. Banks are nowhere near ""too big to fail"" anymore.
6. People can choose to invest their Bitcoin into various projects to try to multiply their wealth and they understand that they can lose their money if the project fails, end of story.
7. There is a free market for interest rates. Loans are largely sourced from private lenders and/or banks, but there is no more central bank nor a national interest rate decided by a small group of people. 
8. There is still a stock market because companies still have the freedom to try to publicly fund their business ideas, but it's no longer the behemoth that it once was as money is hard money and isn't as easy to come by as it once was.

Are their big holes in this economic model? I'm sure I'm missing important parts as it's impossible to summarize an economy. Feel free to add your own thoughts and ideas.

Bitcoin," I've been seeing a lot of new people that seem to have no grasp on the basics of economics regarding currency, what gives it value, etc. I posted this as a comment in another thread that didn't get much attention, so I thought I would post it again as its own post to help those who are new to Bitcoin or don't have much understanding of the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin as a currency.

First  you need to ask yourself why the Dollar has any value. Learn a bit  about the history of money. The first currencies were commodity money.  They derived their value from their intrinsic use. But they were  cumbersome to use. So we invented paper money that was backed by  commodities such as gold, which could be exchanged for it, and gave it  value. In 1972 the US Fed stopped allowing Dollars to be exchanged for  gold, making our money fiat money with no backing. Fiat means ""command"".  It is created out of nothing by an issuing authority.

Now  think about what the Federal Reserve has been doing, and the effects  their actions have had on the economy. They previously lowered interest  rates to 0%. Interest rates are the cost of obtaining money. Money that  has no cost to obtain has no value, and an unlimited supply. The money  supply has been increased by more than 40% over the last 2 years, and  much more than that over the previous century. You can view the Fed's  own data here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)  . The value of the  Dollar over the long term is trending toward zero,  along with every other fiat currency. Look at this chart and see how  much value it has lost over time. [https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/1800?amount=1](https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/1800?amount=1)

Most  money is already digital. It's just a database in your bank's servers  that has names associated with amounts. Less than 10% of the money  supply exists as cash. It would be impossible for everyone to convert  their electronic deposits into cash. Banks actually create extra money  in the money supply when they make loans. Reserve requirements were  suspended in the COVID era meaning banks could create unlimited amounts  of loans with no reserves at all.

This  is stuff you would all learn in an intro Economics class. But it's very  fundamental to understanding why any currency has value, or loses its  value. Money derives its value from being something that is: fungible,  durable, divisible, portable, and limited in supply. The more of these  properties it has, the better it is as money. It must serve as a unit of  account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value. The better it is  at these things, the better it is as money.

Bitcoin  has all of these qualities, making it useful as money. It's much more  divisible than the Dollar, much  more portable, and more limited in  supply. So far, the Bitcoin network has never had a major outage or  hack. It is free and open source, with out a central authority. So far,  its value has only gone up over the long term despite its high  volatility in the short term.

Limited  supply is essential a currency's potential as a long term store of  value. Many countries have hyperinflated their currencies with  disastrous results. Right now around the world many countries are  experiencing extremely high amounts of inflation. Learn about what has  happened in Argentina, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Hungary, and many more  countries due to hyperinflation. It's a crisis around the world. Almost  all the world's countries use fiat currency now. Many people in these  countries face authoritarian governments, or do not have access to a  stable currency. Bitcoin has obvious usefulness to these people as well  as anyone else who wants an alternative to fiat money that will do  nothing but lose value over time.",The basic economics of why Bitcoin has value,1.0,1,zq0gf4,Future-Iterations,0,2022-12-19 19:07:06,1671476842,1671476842,2022-12-19,19:07:06

Bitcoin,"From the court documents of home robbery of 5.1 bitcoins.....

Home robbery

On the evening of Thursday, June 24, 2021, the doorbell rang at the home of the declarant [victim] (hereinafter: declarant) at the [street name] in Leeuwarden. There were three men in green KPN jackets at his door. They said they were there because of the upstairs neighbor's fiber optic cable having a malfunction. And that cable would also run through the meter cupboard of the declarant. 2 One of the men suddenly pushed his arm against the throat of the declarant and put his other arm around his neck. It was said that they came before his ledger 3 . Initially, the declarant could not explain what had happened afterwards. 4 On 15 July 2021, the declarant stated that he was held in a stranglehold by the big boy in his home and that he was beaten. That's all he could remember. 5

The declarant gave the following description of the man who grabbed him: he was slightly tinted, possibly of Moroccan origin and his length reached his eyebrows. The declarant himself is 1.92 meters. The man spoke good Dutch. The man standing at the window had a stocky build and a stubble beard. The reporter could not give a description of the third man. All three men wore green jackets, one of which was brighter in color. 6

5.1 Bitcoin was taken in the robbery. 7 The declarant had two ledgers and two recovery seeds 8 with which access could be gained to his bitcoins. One of the ledgers was in a white bowl in the kitchen. 9 If the recovery seed had not been found, then according to the declarant it could only be that he had given the code of the ledger under duress. 10 The Ledger Live program on the declarant's computer is used to transfer bitcoins. To do this, the ledger must be connected to the computer and a pin code must be entered that the declarant knows by heart. According to the declarant, the code was knocked out of him during the robbery or the code was stored in a text file on his computer. 11

Two neighbors of the declarant were heard as witnesses. Witness [name 1] heard someone banging on his door at midnight on 24 June 2021. He found the reporter. His wrists and ankles were duct taped. His arms were tied behind his body and the duct tape stretched from the tips of his fingers to his wrists. The reporter had a cut on his head that was bleeding profusely and his left eye was swollen and closed. 12

Witness [name 2] lives in the apartment above that of the declarant. He was asked for help by witness [name 1]. He saw that the declarant had tape around his mouth and a lot of tape and a tie wrap around his wrists. His head was blue. Witness [name 2] heard people in the home of the declarant between 9:30 PM and 10:30 PM. This was striking, because the declarant hardly ever had visitors in the evening. 13

Officers who approached the report found the declarant with a bloodied face with multiple swellings. He was very confused and the injury seemed to be affecting his memory. 14

The declarant was examined in the hospital by a forensic doctor on 25 June 2021. He has been diagnosed with mild traumatic skull-brain injury and bruises and abrasions all over his body. In addition, he had blurred vision, his eyelids were significantly swollen and he had a wound above his eyebrow.

Miners are rewarded by finding blocks and are rewarded by bitcoins (and transaction fees, which are very low) but what happens when all the bitcoins have been mined?

Or will transaction fees increase once all bitcoins have been mined?  but that would be bad for us as a community in that case, because every transaction would be too expensive for us?  or am I wrong?

Bitcoin,"Due to bitcoin's hard cap, if bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency and all things become naturally priced in bitcoin, this would mean that each bitcoin and each sat will become more and more valuable as the economy grows. I know assuming the economy will grow indefinitely is not as trivial as I'm making it sound but let's just assume it'll be the case for this thought experiment.

So basically, things will cost less and less bitcoin, and we will reach a point when a single gummy bear will be worth less than 1 sat. At this point, we'll need a smaller unit in order to pay for everyday stuff. Even a cup of coffee will be worth less than 1 sat eventually.

Bitcoin,"Ok, basic question here, to my knowledge BTC requires miners to validate transactions (proof of work), and mining requires an expenditure of energy which costs generally some kind of fiat currency.  As Bitcoin halves and becomes harder to mine, the relative profit margin approaches the cost of mining, further fluctuations in the value of BTC potentially means putting miners underwater versus the cost of mining (electricity/hardware).

What happens when the cost of mining outstrips the profit of BTC?

Say, the cost of mining one BTC is 1.5 BTCs in the relative fiat currency?  If miners drop out, and transactions cannot be validated, the relative exchange value of BTC is thus 0?  Since no exchange can take place.

Is there something I'm missing here?  This seems like a weakness inherent to PoW crypto, especially BTC, which has a growing cost to mine based upon the halving aspect of the hash mining.

Further, I cannot think of a real world counterpart, since exchanging gold isn't incumbent on anyone mining it.  In fact, as gold miners drop out the cost of gold would increase due to the effect of scarcity.

I'm sure I'm missing something, since this seems like an obvious real threat to crypto as an investment vehicle, at least proof of work models that rely on mining to validate exchanges/transactions.",Question concerning solvency of Bitcoin.,1.0,1,zom6ui,AlphaRustacean,0,2022-12-18 01:17:17,1671326254,1671326254,2022-12-18,01:17:17

Bitcoin," 

Hey everyone,

I just wanted to share my thoughts on Bitcoin with the community. As a fairly new Bitcoiner myself, I am constantly amazed by the resilience and strength of this revolutionary digital asset.

One thing that really stands out to me is the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Unlike traditional financial systems that are controlled by a small group of individuals or institutions, Bitcoin is powered by a global network of nodes that work together to secure the blockchain. This decentralization ensures that no single entity has control over the network, making it resistant to censorship and corruption.

Another aspect of Bitcoin that I find particularly impressive is its ability to act as a store of value. While the price of Bitcoin can fluctuate in the short term, its value has consistently increased over time, making it a reliable investment for the long haul.

But perhaps what I love most about Bitcoin is its potential to bring financial freedom to people around the world. In countries with unstable currencies or oppressive governments, Bitcoin provides a way for individuals to take control of their own wealth and financial future.

Overall, I am bullish on Bitcoin and can't wait to see what the future holds for this groundbreaking technology. What about you guys? Why do you love Bitcoin?",Feeling Grateful for Bitcoin,1.0,1,zo7x6u,xXShadowAssassin69Xx,0,2022-12-17 14:53:39,1671288830,1671288830,2022-12-17,14:53:39
Bitcoin,"Nowadays it's so easy to sign up for a credit card and start earning cash back on your purchases. Some people even make thousands of dollars a year doing so.

Bitcoin,"Well, I live in Brazil and here almost everything involving crypto is very limited to a social class from mining (equipment with insane prices) to even purchasing (99% of the trusted sites only accept credit cards and not prepaid credit cards) or another form of payment in addition to having a purchase requirement greater than 10USD/53,07BRL), I would like to know if there is any that accept fractional purchases from 1USD/5,31BRL
Currently I use an app called Bipa to buy because they accept pix (a kind of digital transfer between bank accounts) as a payment method and I convert the amount I transferred to Bitcoin and send it to my Coinbase. The problem is that I practically lose almost half of the value I have that way with fees, etc....

Bitcoin,"Hello everyone, today I would like to share with you an indicator I created that calculates the fair price of bitcoins by taking into account the cost of energy consumed by miners.

The Bitcoin Intrinsic Value Cost of Energy (BIVCOE) indicator stems from an algorithm that relates data on the energy consumption of the bitcoin network to the supply in circulation, in doing so I was able to establish the cost required in energy terms to ‚Äúproduce‚Äù a bitcoin. Potentially, an intrinsic value of the coin that when correlated with the market price will be able to give interesting insights into overbought/sold cycles.

I was able to develop this indicator thanks to data provided by the University of Cambridge related to energy consumption, this data is extremely efficient and with a relatively low error rate as it is based on a mathematical model that takes into account multiple factors including the evolution of the profitability threshold of the miners (obsolescence).

[**HERE**](https://intelligence.deliacapital.com/bitcoin-intrinsic-value-cost-of-energy/) **you can find the indicator that is updated every month.**

Bitcoin,"I'm a staunch advocate and believer, I'm extremely highly confident in Bitcoin and I'm sure it'll be a bulwark as we enter a new era of enlightenment for humanity. I've been involved for over a decade and don't need all of the lectures on how and why that's going to happen. There are a hundred threads every day where everyone discusses this, and that's great and we should continue to do that. But can we consider some scenarios where it might not play out how we expect? Maybe we can think about these scenarios, assess their plausibility, increase our understanding, and make plans as a community to deal with them.

I'll start with a fairly obvious one. As much as we don't like it some recent events that shall not be named have evidently tarnished the reputation of Bitcoin with the masses in the short term and people have backed out as a consequence. If hashing power dips to a point where a state actor could feasibly make a 51% attack on the network we're probably done. I don't believe we'd be able to recover from it, and I don't believe we'd be able to co-ordinate an effort to continue a successor chain, or even a new protocol, and pick up where we left off.

Bitcoin,"Based on my research from books ,podcasts, videos, articles etc.

Bitcoin is:

1. A peer to peer way of transferring money without need of a 3rd party
2. A method of saving that can't be confiscated by the government
3. A long term (10 years plus) hedge against inflation
4. Hard money that can't be counterfeit
5. A pension fund for your retirement when you turn 60-70 yrs old.
6. A safe way to store value in the long term as long as you keep your seed phrase/pass phrase safe
7. A way to help improve the lives of people in countries where the government has hyperinflated their native currency (ex. Venezuela, Turkey, Lebanon etc.)
8. A path to long term generational wealth

A Great lesson relayed by Mike
 Harvard Business School 101
 
Not long ago a merchant found a lot of monkeys that lived near a certain Village.  One day he came to the Village saying he wanted to buy these monkeys.  He announced that he would buy the monkeys at $100 each.
&gt;
&gt; The Villagers thought that this man must be crazy.  How can somebody buy stray monkeys at $100 each?
&gt;
&gt; Still some People caught some monkeys and gave it to this merchant and he gave $100 for each monkey.
&gt;
&gt; This news spread like wildfire and People caught monkeys and sold them to the merchant.
&gt;
&gt; After a few days, the merchant announced that he will buy monkeys at $200 each.
&gt;
&gt; The lazy villagers also ran around to catch the remaining monkeys. They sold the remaining monkeys at $200 each.
&gt;
&gt; The merchant then announced that he will buy monkeys for $500 each.
&gt;
&gt; The villagers start to lose sleep.  They caught six or seven monkeys which was all that was left and got $500 each.
&gt;
&gt; The Villagers were waiting anxiously for the next announcement.
&gt;
&gt; Then the merchant announced that he is going on holiday for a week, but when he returns, he will buy monkeys at $1000 each!  He also said that his employee will be in charge, and would take care of the monkeys he bought pending his return.
&gt;
&gt; The Merchant went on holiday.
&gt;
&gt; The Villagers were frantic and very sad as there were no more monkeys left for them to sell at $1000 each as was promised by the Merchant.
&gt;
&gt; Then the Merchant‚Äôs Employee contacted them and told them that he would secretly sell them some monkeys at $700 each.
&gt;
&gt; The news spread like wildfire.  As the Merchant promised on his return that he would buy monkeys at $1000 each, they would achieve a $300 profit for each monkey. The next day the Villagers queued up near the Monkey Cage.
&gt;
&gt; The Employee sold all the monkeys at $700 each.  The rich bought monkeys in large lots.  The poor borrowed money from money lenders and bought the rest of the monkeys.
&gt;
&gt; The Villagers took care of their monkeys and waited for the Merchant to return. However nobody came!  Then they ran to find the Employee.  However he was not to be found.
&gt;
&gt; The Villagers then realized that they have been duped buying the useless stray monkeys at $700 each, and were now unable to sell them.

Bitcoin,"Hi everyone!

Let's say an exchange allows you to transfer only 0,05 BTC daily.
So you have to send X times each day to transfer your funds from the exchange.

Is it better (fee-wise) to:

a) transfer those funds to the same address X times,

or

b) transfer each day to a different and NEWLY created address (no previous history)?

I'm asking because I read that later on, the fees would be lower if you're sending from X different addresses (same wallet), which have just the history of 1 previous transaction vs sending from one address which has the history of all the X transactions.

Apparently it's less space consuming (?) to check the history in the a) case than the b) case, hence less fees to be applied.",Fees cost when transferring from 1 address with history of X transactions vs from x,1.0,1,znqzo3,uniagi,0,2022-12-16 22:28:37,1671229736,1671229737,2022-12-16,22:28:37

Bitcoin,"The dependence on the government‚Äôs ability to print money has created an unbalanced master-slave paradigm where the people are forced to involuntarily finance the government‚Äôs money printer. This reliance on government printing has effectively removed the accountability of public entities as they no longer work for the people, but rather the money printer. 

The government‚Äôs ability to endlessly print money without repercussions means that the people no longer own their government. The lack of checks and balances in the system has caused public entities to instead look to outside sources such as corporations, Wall Street, foreign nations, and the military industrial complex for extra money, similar to a side hustle for a paycheck. This creates a conflict of interests, as the people no longer own their government, and the government is now working for the money printer, not the people. 

This is why there is such a disconnect between the government and the people these days. The people are increasingly feeling unacknowledged and unheard, and this is due to the government‚Äôs reliance on its money printer. Public entities are no longer accountable to the public as they only strive to please the money printer. 

The good news is that there is a solution to this problem, and that is bitcoin. By creating a decentralized monetary system, the people can take back ownership of their government, as the money printer no longer holds the power. Bitcoin creates an environment of financial freedom, as the government no longer has the power to control the money supply. Furthermore, it creates the transparency that the government and the people need in order to work together. 

In conclusion, since the transition from hard money to fiat money, the government has become a master and the people have become its slaves. Public entities are no longer accountable to the people, as they now work for the money printer. However, with the introduction of bitcoin, the people can once again take back ownership of their government and create a more transparent and fair relationship between the two parties.",Who works for whom?,1.0,1,znqnpq,andrwuz,0,2022-12-16 22:14:04,1671228862,1671228863,2022-12-16,22:14:04

Bitcoin,"Hi,

Question about cashing in BTC.

I've been hodling a handful of BTC for almost 10 years, with a few shitcoin excursions in the early years.

Since then, just hodled quite conservatively.

Here's the complex part:

I bought almost all of them with cash from an ATM at &lt; 1000e. 

I have no receipts, no proof of purchase and I have mostly self-custodied them on a multiple hardware wallets since. 

Funds have moved wallets multiple times and I don't have all the transactions in between then and now. I do have some records from old exchanges but not a complete history.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I think I might be able to control my 'first' hardware wallet. As a privacy proponent I also mixed some the coins a few years ago. 

So now I'm in a situation where I need to grudginly cash in some of it to stay warm in the house.

I have an understanding that a traditional bank would naturally frown at this. 

What kind of proof does a bank need in this case, how to go about 'proving ownership' or what is the procedure? 

I am not looking for p2p cash deals either.

What are my options? Does anyone have any experience on how to go about this in a legitimate way? 

Any legal, professional advice, information would be helpful. Based in EU.

Let‚Äôs say we invest $100 in Bitcoin today at the current price of $17,000 per coin would give you approximately 0.00588 of a Bitcoin. If the expected price of $1 million per coin in 2030 is realized, then your investment will be worth $5,882, which is a 58x return. This prediction is based on seven assumptions, such as increasing demand for Bitcoin and using a confident and polite tone. As the demand for Bitcoin continues to rise, the value of the coin is expected to increase as well.
I am confident that Bitcoin has a limited supply, making it an attractive asset for long-term investments. As Bitcoin continues to become accepted worldwide, its value is likely to continue to increase, further facilitating its usage and stability. Furthermore, increasing investments in Bitcoin from institutional investors will increase its liquidity and demand, making it an even more attractive option for investors. Overall, I am optimistic about the future of Bitcoin and believe it will continue to be a viable asset for investors.
The infrastructure for Bitcoin transactions needs to be improved in order to make it easier for users to transact and invest in Bitcoin. With more people using Bitcoin to store their wealth, its value is likely to continue to increase, making it a potentially good investment over the next 8 years.

Bitcoin,"Why is this so?

BTC represents Hope!!

We major tenants as well as the new and future BTC Maxi's believe that as money is separated from State, the political class gets demonetized globally. This means their ability to make war is over. The military industrial complexes collapse a little, and all the energy, money, and resources spent there can get redistributed. This is bitcoin's vision of wealth redistribution. The hope is borders fall a bit, and tax levies are impaired enough that only projects of value with transparent accounting get the cut. This is the future for a world of peace and civility for our planet. This is what is necessary for our future generation's survival. The hope is because BTC has a habit of appreciating in value, consumer's time preferences get longer, and gone is the mindless nonsense consumerism, and this combined with deflationary pressure of the asset, not only keeps consumer prices equitable, but allows someone working even a menial job the ability to store their work energy in an asset that won't depreciate.

BTC Dystopia:

We never said that BTC is without flaws.

* It won't be easy watching as most of the brick and mortar banking institutions shut their doors because they are not needed as much anymore.  
* It won't be easy watching our military forces budget reduced by half or more.
* It won't be easy watching a full hour of TV without seeing a pharmaceutic ad.
* It won't be easy watching that abandoned building on the corner transformed into a food service bank for those who have nothing and are hungry.
* It won't be easy watching that other building adapted to a free medical facility for those who have less.

Quick question here. So I have always used the legacy address on my harware wallet when I withdraw from exchanges, I have noticed that the exchange I currently use is using the BC1adress, which I think is native Segwit (you can correct me if I am wrong).

Should I start using the BC1 receiving address on my hardware wallet? Also for what I already have in the legacy address, should I eventually make a tranfer to my BC1 address o  tje same wallet? (The wallet support legacy, segwit and native segwit).

Trying to understand what is the best practice here.

Bitcoin,"(My price points are referenced in CAD). 

People always refer to ATH's, and the couple of crazy bullruns we had in the end of 2017, and once covid hit. 

I don't think those bull runs are indicative of the real price of bitcoin. They are sexy sure, and everyone loves high flying numbers... But if you look at all time charts and cut out the mountain peaks, you see a real steady growth. 


From prices before the bull run in 2020, bitcoin has doubled. 


I don't know how to articulate it very well, but covid saw interest rates basically cut to 0%, and governments doing everything they could to keep the ball moving forward while facing a once in a hundred year crisis. 


I think the people that expect bitcoin to hit 100k-200k+ in the next bull run, are not factoring in extreme anomalies in market conditions.  


Bitcoin was 5k before the 2017/18 bull run, and bitcoin was 10-15k in 2020 before the covid bull run, and now it's holding it's own in the  22-26k price range despite INCREDIBLY bearish events that sparked panic in the bitcoin / crypto world.  I think this is really promising. 


Sure, maybe bitcoin could go parabolic when aliens invade or some other unforeseen event happens, but... I think the:


-  5k to 15k in 2 years and, 15k to 25k in 2 years 


Is the most realistic value trajectory, which still makes it one of the most incredible stores of value and appreciating assets in our current times.  Somewhere in the range of 80-150% growth every 2-3 years is fucking insane. 



Anyways... I just wanted to give a realistic not ""WHEN MY LAMBO!?!?!"" take on the longterm gains on bitcoin.

Bitcoin,"One of the easiest attack possible on ALL blockchains is the replay attack.It basically takes advantages of hard-forks to use a valid transaction from one of the chain and broadcast it to another.Let‚Äôs take an example.We create an hardfork called BWEF (bitcoin WEF). Of course our shitcoin will be shorted on market and nobody will supports it. But like ETHW, people will know they can sell it and get ‚Äúfee‚Äù money.
You have 5 BTC so you received 5 BWEF, trading each for 300$. 1,5K for free ! let‚Äôs dump it quick !So you wanna swap you BWEF on a website for $. Free money houray !In order to do this you have to send your BWEF by creating a transaction and signing it.You then sell and get your dollars.
So you got your 1,5K$ for a shitcoin you didn‚Äôt want anyway. That‚Äôs just a win right ?But here is the issue: your transaction is public and is also valid on real BTC chain.
SO now an attacker can broadcast this same transaction on original chain. This could be the buyer of your BWEF.Now the buyer as received your BWEF and your real BTC. You‚Äôre sold your 5 BTC for 1,5K$.


So now let‚Äôs talk about how to protect from this. Afaik there is no way to protect from what I just describe. The only thing we can do is to avoid interacting with forked chains. Which can be difficult because most people don‚Äôt use their own node. So when signing and broadcasting a transaction they may be sending it to a node of the forked chain.So if someone knows more about this and would like to correct me, share infos like how to protect or anything, please do.I think this would help greatly community.",Replay attacks on blockchains,1.0,1,zmzhpj,Tyranoc4,0,2022-12-15 23:14:26,1671146085,1671146085,2022-12-15,23:14:26

Bitcoin,"The only thing i think is missing about bitcoin technology, is a way to really slowly recycle itself.
Let me explain. 

Imagine in th√© far future, when all bitcoins will be mined or almost. 

The biggest bitcoin sources available will be old storages from our time, old account, lost bitcoins, etc. 

They will probably be an industry trying to found them back in a way or another. 

The amount of lost bitcoin will be massive. 
And compared to th√© mining production, they will be a time where finding only a single one hard Wallet from our time could be worth of multiple year of mining production. 

This is not a sane balance for an economy.

The non lost bitcoins, will be used for th√© economy. 
But, if they are BTc holders who are too big, they will own a too big % of th√© total amount of money to exist. 
Let‚Äôs say a familly for exemple, that inherited 100000 bitcoin from generation to generation. 
They could or own Stupid amount of things, or acting by themselves as a modifier of bitcoin value orders of magnitudes too high, probably with the ability to make prices triple or divide by 3 easily.

If a money like this exist in far future, propose who are not privilegied by it will legitimately look away for other solition. And probably create other cryptos collectively and decide to use them instead. 

What would be a (imo) sane thing to do, is adding a ¬´¬†evaporating rate¬†¬ª to bitcoin. 

Let me explain. 
To avoid that few peoples could own too massive proportion of bitcoins and keep the currency viable, and fair enough to let peoples continue to use it, 

We could Maybe add a system who could make a small √©vaporation rat√© happen. 

So, for exemple, each year, 1/1000 of the btc you own evaporate and go back to the mineable bitcoin pool. ( numbers can vary)

This will Also allow a renewable and constant suply of new btc. 

This is the most equal option. Everyone have the same ¬´¬†evapotax¬†¬ª

We could Also balance this in a more ¬´¬†fair¬†¬ª way. 

Like: 
Evaporzting bitcoin faster for biggest bitcoin holders above some cap.

To avoid peoples to squeeze this by dividing their wealth into multiple account, we will need them to be or nominated to a single person or to a single family. ( and a way to make sure it is not squeezable) 

Then, let‚Äôs say that for each time you own 10x more than the AVERAGE account balance, ( to let this method grow with increasing of decreasing population) you pay twice more. 
( so 2/1000 per year evaporate of your BTC above 10 time the average balance. 4/1000 above 100 time the average 
8/1000 above 1000 time the average, 
16 10000 32 100k 64 1M time th√© average, etc etc. 
12% evaporate per year at 10 million time the average, 24% at 100 million time, 48% at a billion time, etc. 

That Also add an incentive to make th√© average peoples wealthier. 

So, it will be really hard to own more than a billion time the average person wealth. Who seem like a minimum to keep things somehow balanced. Of course that‚Äôs random number that could be adjusted up or down. 

That will keep the economy somewhat balanced and allow more evaporation to happen, and at the same time still allow for big fortunes to exist, but without having too much inequalities.  ( capped in this exemple at 1 billion time the average, Because after that 96% evaporate per year. So basically all of it) 
We could maybe even imagine a system where the under average balances get a small percentage of wealth evaporated from big one. 

We could say that like half evaporation go to mining and half to slightly lower inequalities.

Could be a modest redistributive and fair economical system. 

We need also a way to make peoples who die inherit their fortune to their kids, to avoid the death peoples accounts to count among the total number of active accounts. 

And if not possible, redistributed to the mining pool. 

This way, we could have a monetary system bitcoin like, with a fix amount of currency, 
A way to SLOWLY get back potential lost bitcoins, (trough evaporation) 
A way to SLOWLY give back bitcoin to the mining pool, and keep the suply running,

A way to avoid too much inequalities but STILL allowing fortunes to exist without allowing too indecent ones or monopoles to, 

A way ( potentially) to redistribute a part of the wealth to the less fortunate trough a part of the evaporation ( we could call this condensation) on lower than average or average balanced account ( this will be a low amount in any case because lower than average account and average account will be much more in number than the above ones who pay for it) 

And that‚Äôs how you keep a currency system sane stable and fiable for extremely long periods of time, 
And make it Automatically adjusted to total population number changes ( up or down) 
Allowing humanity to eventually becaume a multi planetary specie ( as we should be if we are not filtered out of existence before) 

And that‚Äôs how you Also assure peoples to be able to keep a stable, decentralised, predictible, non inflationist currency, 
Who evaporate or not at all, or reaaaly slowly depending on how rich you are. 
( also putting a smaaaaal pressure on peoples to spend or invest and keep the money moving in the economy) 

Being rich is this world would only mean owning a bigger part of the cake, who evaporate faster, and of nothing is done, or if badly used or lost, will go back to average with time, trough evaporation who go half to the less fortunate half for the miners who keep the thing working. 


A bitcoin made on this kind of system could be much more viable long term, and even becaume a ultimate and universal currency. 
Alway adjusting itself to any situation to go back to the society wealth distribution programated, in some years, and still of course remunerating miners and mining who make the system work and continue to. 


That‚Äôs an interesting topic imo.  


And could be the solution to a lot of issue that today currency have, or even cryptos have, or even decentralised cryptos have.

If you move Bitcoin to a cold storage wallet then I understand that it is not on your computer anymore and that this is more secure as you can't get hacked unless somebody gets the cold storage drive and knows how to get in.

But if you move Bitcoin to, say, an Electrum wallet and save the seed phrase (on paper somewhere or in your head), and then you delete the Electrum app completely from your computer then also you would not be able to hacked via your computer if somebody gained access to it.

So what really is the difference or pros/cons of the 2 approaches?

Bitcoin,"Hey Reddit!

We're excited to announce the launch of **MinIT**, our new heating solution that uses the computing power of a mining server to generate heat. With our unique technology, you can reduce your dependence on fossil fuels and save on energy costs, all while participating in the Bitcoin network.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ui74d5ayc36a1.gif

MinIT is equipped with a domestic hot water calorifier with a volume of 120 liters, and it incorporates hot water storage capable of storing up to 10 kilowatts of energy in the form of heat. It can convert over 90% of the heat generated by the mining server into domestic hot water, up to 70¬∞C.

Connected to your existing heating system, MinIT produces additional electrical heat on demand, reducing the consumption of your main heating system. It's an easy and effective way to make the most of your existing heating system, and it's mainly aimed at reducing the consumption of fuel oil and natural gas.

**But why is MinIT the best heating solution out there?** Here are a few reasons:

* It's **smart and efficient**. MinIT uses the computing power of a mining server to generate heat, making the most of the energy being used. And with its hot water storage system, it can provide additional heat on demand, reducing the need for your main heating system to run as often.
* It's **environmentally friendly**. By reducing your dependence on fossil fuels, you're helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change. And by participating in the Bitcoin network, you're supporting a decentralized and renewable energy-based system.
* It's **accessible and affordable**. MinIT is easy to install and can be integrated into your existing heating system, making it a convenient and cost-effective solution for heating your home.

If you're interested in learning more about MinIT, [check out our website](https://minit.tresorio.com/en)

Bitcoin mining thrives on cheap electricity, and there is no cheaper electricity than that which is provided by the sun for free, harnessed through solar panels and stored in batteries for later consumption until the sun rises again the next day to start the charge and usage cycle all over again.

A perfect clean circle of energy generation and storage, and the only ones incentivized to invest and develop it to the level needed are those whose businesses thrive on the lowest cost source of electricity, a free source of electricity that allows them to HODL the most finite asset in existence that they mine with that free electricity to experience the asset‚Äôs long term value appreciation; Bitcoin miners.

Bitcoin,"It's good that our growing community has fully turned its back on Bernie Madoff I mean SBF. But we can't allow the many, many hands which helped him and actively participated in this scheme which ultimately had geopolitical and lasting implications. 

Take, for example, the coder who built in the Alameda exception for carte blanche credit (https://archive.ph/2022.12.13-212904/https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-secret-software-change-allowed-ftx-use-client-money-2022-12-13/), Nishad Singh.

Bitcoin,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a quick story about Bitcoin that really showcases its potential to change the world.

A few months ago, I was traveling abroad and I found myself in a situation where I needed to exchange some money into the local currency. I didn't have any cash on me, and I didn't want to deal with the fees and hassles of using a traditional bank or exchange service.

That's when I remembered that I had some Bitcoin in my digital wallet. I was able to quickly and easily convert my Bitcoin into the local currency using a Bitcoin ATM, and I was able to complete my transaction without any fees or hassle.

This experience really highlighted the power of Bitcoin and its ability to enable fast, secure, and convenient financial transactions. With Bitcoin, I was able to bypass the traditional financial system and exchange money directly with another person, without any intermediaries or third parties.

But that's not even the most exciting part. By using Bitcoin, I was able to complete my transaction without revealing any personal information or sensitive financial data. This anonymity and security is a game-changer for anyone who values their privacy and wants to protect their financial information.

In short, Bitcoin has the potential to revolutionize the way that we handle money, and I'm incredibly excited to see what the future holds for this groundbreaking technology.",Anecdote traveling abroad,1.0,1,zmkeq3,nomadeth,0,2022-12-15 12:55:06,1671108921,1671108921,2022-12-15,12:55:06

Guess what? I didnt verify it, i didnt care about getting my account deactivated and they still send me emails and sms telling the same every other day, like i only can do withdrawals now or come back fast and grab this gift from us or verify your account and blahblahblah.

Bitcoin," Lately I have been having a bit of an existential crisis with the true utility of the blockchain. I was initially drawn in by the digital goldrush, but like many I stayed because I really believed in the future of crypto. As this bear market has progressed, I have been filtering through the junk. As I dive deeper into crypto and blockchain technology I am starting to see less how the blockchain has real utility. Here are a couple of my opinions. I would love if somebody with more knowledge of the space could refute anything I say with evidence. 

Possibly crypto's greatest strength is the decentralized network and ability to process instantaneous transactions. This is especially useful for large payments and international transactions. The problem is there no easy way to convert Bitcoin to fiat without using a centralized exchange. The argument would be that eventually we could use bitcoin or other tokens as transactional currency, but we are still far from there. Needing to rely on exchanges to convert Bitcoin to fiat comes with many of the problems that come with transferring money to begin with. At the end of the day unless you are transferring crypto from one wallet to another and the receiving party plans on just holding the crypto it offers very little improvement to wire transfers. 

The second issue I have is with linking tokens or NFTs to physical goods. Despite the blockchain being a brilliant and secure way of tracing transactions, since there is no way to link a real physical world item to the blockchain it makes tracing items impossible. I often hear about using blockchain in regard to the supply chain. Assuming a QR code is used to track certain items the QR code can always be removed or recreated. It would also rely on always scanning the QR code to track it. If the code is not scanned, then the transaction will never show up. In the case of digital items like NFT Art it costs so much energy to upload Medidata on chain that it is not feasible. Most NFTs rely on Medidata servers to store the NFT which makes the whole point of having a Blochian pointless to begin with. You can‚Äôt hide the Medidata for confidential documents, you don‚Äôt own the copyright to the NFT in a legal sense, and you can‚Äôt prevent anybody from copying the Medidata you ‚Äúown on the blockchain‚Äù.  

This leads to the last point which is most if not all crypto projects are creating solutions to problems they invented. Aside from the obvious pump and dumps, even ""legitimate"" projects do not offer real world value. It seems like so much of crypto relies on the narrative that we will be socializing, transacting, and living more in the digital world. Most projects assume one day their project will be useful. While that may be the case it seems like we are still far from living in a Ready Player 1 style world. I don‚Äôt know of any projects except Bitocin that that solve a problem that exists today and solves the problem in a way no other technology could.

To summarize it seems like crypto is a cool technology that has very little practical use in today‚Äôs world. I still love the crypto world and I want to believe in it, but I am seeing less and less a true use for it. As I take off the goggles and try to look at everything from a practical and productive point of view the argument for crypto is becoming less and less clear to me.

Bitcoin,"I started investing in Bitcoin about this time last year. Yeah, the ATH. At that time I very much had two mindsets. 1) As a libertarian, anti-FED computer programmer, I *finally* fell in love with the beauty, simplicity, and transparency of Bitcoin - God knows why it took me so long, but it probably is related to the second point. 2) I definitely at the time was in a betting/gambling mindset where FOMO was a big motivation, and this tendency is likely why I ignored Bitcoin for so long - I assumed I had ‚Äúmissed the boat.‚Äù

So this leads me to today. In the last year, I put most of my savings into Bitcoin and I DCA‚Äôd a a solid 15% of my take-home pay as well. I would have more USD value had I just saved in cash (like I had been doing for a couple years prior). Yet, I have no regrets, and I want to say why.

I was lucky to have a mentor in Bitcoin who both stoked the flames of my passion, but also constantly reminded me of the core principles and goals of Bitcoin, and he would say ‚Äúplease, only put into Bitcoin what you can afford to lose.‚Äù

I took that advice, though I was a bit liberal with the definition of ‚Äúwhat I can afford to lose.‚Äù But still remained within the bounds of no regrets. While I put a LOT into BTC, I maintained a substantial emergency fund in USD, I did not completely ignore my 401k, and never once did I have to sell any Bitcoin.

I have transitioned from wanting the price to go higher for my value in USD to go up, to wanting the price to go down to be able to buy more BTC, to finally not caring what the price is and stacking regardless.

This is the only asset in the world that will keep its scarcity. I‚Äôm just glad to be able to obtain any amount of it without putting the rest of my life at risk.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin vs. CBDCs: Spycoin Coming Soon

So we already have micro CBDC‚Äôs in the form of social security benefits, ebt, disability income, among other government subsidized programs. CBDC‚Äôs would basically be the United States dollar, except there will be more rules in regards to how exactly you can use a CBDC. For example, there may be a limit to what type of items you can buy (You probably won‚Äôt be able to buy liquor or tobacco with a CBDC. If you are, it will probably only be on the weekends in the afternoon, or something parental like that).  

Bitcoin is important because while a CBDC is basically a dollar that impinges on your privacy, the bitcoin network makes sure your payment will be accepted, no matter what. Imagine an international bank that never closes and audits every transaction every 10 minutes to ensure the validity of the network; that‚Äôs bitcoin. 

Jerome Powell controls the price of money, so he could arguably be the most powerful man in the world. The issuance and regulation of CBDCs by central banks could give governments too much control over the flow of money in the economy. 

This could allow governments to track and monitor individual transactions in a way that could infringe on privacy rights.

Another potential concern is that the widespread adoption of CBDCs could make it easier for governments to implement harmful monetary policies, such as negative interest rates. Negative interest rates can have detrimental effects on the economy, including reducing the incentive for individuals and businesses to save and invest. 

Bitcoin is a global currency that can be used and accepted anywhere in the world, whereas CBDCs are tied to a specific country and can only be used within that country's borders. 

This makes bitcoin a more attractive option for individuals and businesses that operate internationally or want to conduct business with people in other countries.

The use of bitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning that transactions can be made without revealing the identity of the parties involved. This can provide a higher level of privacy and security than transactions made using a CBDC, which would be subject to the same regulations and oversight as transactions made using fiat currency.


CBDCs may be perceived as a positive change in the financial system, but in actuality it will create more problems than solutions. Bitcoin offers a permissionless, decentralized, and everlasting alternative that gives users more control over their own funds and provides greater privacy and security. And that makes the world a better place.",Bitcoin Vs. CBDCs: SpyCoin Coming soon,1.0,1,zluqap,MathmaticMorpheus,0,2022-12-14 16:01:38,1671033712,1671033712,2022-12-14,16:01:38

1) Customers deposit cash and/or Tokens to FTX.

2) Cash and/or Tokens go to Alameda for SBF to play with.

3) FTX retains a minimal reserve of cash and Tokens to satisfy normal daily withdrawal from customers.

4) Customers play FTX video game. Trading nothing and a majority losing their money by making bad trades (Hopes SBF and FTX).

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is all about understanding and managing your own risk and trust be that the decision to run a node or not, use a light wallet or not, a company node/wallet or not. You also have to decide who you will give your business to, and what risk you're willing to expose yourself to when engaging with Bitcoin services.

With that in mind let's conceptualize a few different kinds of Bitcoin services so we know to look out for them and can make educated choices as consumers.


**The Low Trust Service**

This is a bitcoin service delivered in a low trust manner where the bitcoin user need only utilize software they run and control for the services and can protect themselves from malicious third parties with very little trust or consequence from peers. This is the gold standard of Bitcoin service. Examples include lightning routing, lightning liquidity marketplaces like [pool](https://lightning.engineering/pool/), [coinjoins](https://nixbitcoin.org/orderbook/) like [joinmarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver), [coinswaps](https://github.com/bitcoin-teleport/teleport-transactions), submarine swaps like [loop](https://lightning.engineering/loop/) and others.

When at all possible this is the kind of service you want to run. Many services and contracts, in Bitcoin or layers, will claim to be low trust - even decentralized (which isn't all necessary for a business, they are supposed to be centralized!) - but very few are. Ask yourself what recourse you alone have against fraud and what fraud would be possible. For example in lightning you protect yourself from fraud by watching the blockchain and storing proof of your off chain transactions you can broadcast at will. You have responsibility (watch the blockchain) and recourse (publish transactions proving fraud and claim balance). The risks revolve around your own capacity, time delays locking up your coins, and other general inconveniences not impacting your custody.


**Trust The Service Will Be Provided**

This is your typical business or website where you pay for the good or service before you get it and have little to no recourse if the service is not provided. Pretty normal, you're risking whatever you're spending in a transaction. Examples include every merchant business accepting bitcoin, the merchants using [BTCPay Server](https://btcpayserver.org/) and non-custodial exchanges like [bullbitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/). This is also a very good model with limited risk, but often little recourse.


**The Federated Trust Service**

This is a bitcoin service which spreads responsibility across a number of actors for success or failure. It's not nearly as good as trusting yourself and relies on third parties to protect your interests. Examples include [Liquid](https://liquid.net/), [RSK](https://www.rsk.co/) peg, Multisig custodians, [BISQ](https://bisq.network/) escrow. These services often delve into shitcoins and when they do should be avoided like any other.  The risk in these cases is often not exceptionally limited, include custody, and your recourse relies on third parties if any exists at all.


**The First Party Custodian**

This bitcoin service relies on only itself. It often prides itself on this self reliance, boasting a lack of third parties and self custody. [River Financial](https://river.com/) is a good example. If you can trust the one business, these can be quality services. The risks in these custodians are similar to a federated service, but only trusting one party.


**The 3rd Party Custodian**

This is a bitcoin service which relies on a third party custodian, like [Prime Trust](https://www.primetrust.com/). Examples include [Strike](https://strike.me/) and [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/) among many others. While both are Bitcoin only companies, the custodian they rely on holds [over 70 shitcoins](https://www.primetrust.com/qualified-custody). These kinds of services can be dangerous because they can appear to be very bold Bitcoin only companies, but on [closer inspection](https://strike.me/faq/bitcoincustody/) you will find they don't self custody - a central tenant of a good Bitcoin participant in the space, user and business alike. This can expose users to all kinds of risks and broadens the number of actors exposing users to risk, even if it's not just custody. For example [Kraken just leaked user data](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yz85kg/psa_kraken_breach_of_security/) via a Zendesk leak. This is why evaluating who you are trusting is important and I make these specific examples to illustrate why you can't take even well respected community members at their word you need to evaluate for yourself - are you trusting them or a tower of service providers?


**The Shitcoin Casino**

This isn't a Bitcoin service at all, it's a public harm. These are exchanges which service and host scams, exposing their users to the custodial risks of their shittiest shitcoin. They often print their own shitcoins. They lure users in with too-good-to-be-true fees. They should be avoided at all cost. Examples include Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini, KuCoin, and many many others. Most others. I won't be linking them because you shouldn't use them.

**TL;DR:**

As you evaluate what kind of businesses and services you want to use, what risks you're willing to expose yourself and your coins to, and hopefully even what kind of businesses you want to encourage in this space - consider all your options. Not every service has made the same trade offs or requires the same trust. Consider minimizing your exposure to this ""contagion"" and not only get off exchanges and custodial services, but reevaluate the services we're doing business with in the first place. Avoid shitcoin custodians and services. Use lower trust solutions.

The question is, would it be enough to implement expansionary and contractionary policies among other things I am ignorant to.

Bitcoin,"Hey everyone!

I'm fairly new to how Bitcoin works, and with everything that's happened recently, it's no surprise I'm in the same boat as a ton of people withdrawing from exchanges, but I'm trying to understand more of the inner working of Bitcoin as I find the tech fascinating.

I withdrew all my funds from FTX (thankfully on time) and more recently Binance and chose Trust Wallet, as I found their ""multi-coin"" wallet from a single mnemonic an interesting idea and the app looks and functions great. The only downside is that there's no way to access some of my wallets from the extension, so I went with Electrum to get my Bitcoin address on my computer.

Here's where my big confusion lies: when I imported my wallet from the mnemonic, I got a bunch of wallets, the first one being the one Trust Wallet gives me (I assume that's how HD wallets work). However, when converting my BIP39 mnemonic to a BIP39 seed, importing that seed in Electrum still works, but I get [completely different addresses](https://imgur.com/hCGgbEg). Is there any logical explanation to this? A friend of mine suggested maybe Electrum does something to the seed, but that possibly can't be the case I'd hope?

As a side question, somewhat unrelated but I'm also wondering, when I created a wallet on Trust, it gave me the mnemonic as it should. Maybe I'm too skeptical but, how is Trust supposed to know it can't give the same mnemonic to someone else? How is it made sure that no other user from any other software / hot wallet app will ever get the same mnemonic as me?

Thank you for your time to anyone that can help me understand those!

ethereum,"Although I have high hopes for blockchain gaming, there are certain evident problems that might limit widespread adoption and give the P2E / NFT gaming industry more negative publicity. I would add to the list some of these issues:  


Most people say that NFT games are not fun,  


I was one of them until I started checking out CoinFantasy or Gods Unchained. It's true that there have been a ton of game tokens and releases in the NFT space recently, and many of them look like garbage with very questionable gameplay. It becomes tough to keep gamers engaged when the gameplay is extremely repetitive and there are less than 30 minutes of it. People just stop playing the game when they stop making money.  


Overall the majority of current P2E games feel more like a job with the worst kind of grind. Would you agree?  


How about a high entry barrier?  


The majority of casual players simply cannot pay the admission cost.  
It causes two related problems: First, the game is inaccessible to regular users, which hinders long-term user growth. Second, investors are typically traders rather than gamers. The developers receive little input when the investors don't actually play the game, and the game gradually dies.  


Poor tokenomics is probably one of the common issues:  


Traders buy NFTs and hire gamers (scholars) to play the game using these NFTs.  
Scholars make money in the form of native crypto tokens.  
Investors and gamers dump the token on new investors.  


However, once new investors stop to join the game, there is no exit liquidity for current investors.  


We all know that traditional gamers hate NFTs, but I believe that one of the problems is that investors have unrealistic expectations. Despite the fact that there are many problems with this sort of gaming in general, I believe that we should give it a try because there are many fantastic games.

ethereum,"So I am asking this question because I recently learnt about what is called ""Internal Transactions"". I was actually reading the answer [here](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/123939/82557) and from this I understand that a transaction between EOA_A and a smart contract can trigger transfers of token from the EOA_A that sent the transaction to another EOA_B, but this transfer of token between EOA_A to EOA_B is not recorded on the blockchain.

My question now is, if one is interested in tracking and be alerted by all activities on an account, how will one do this? For example if I want to be notified when tokens are transfered to EOA_B? Given the fact that the token transfer from EOA_A to EOA_B does not show up in any transaction how can I be notified?

Based on my knowledge, one way could be to listen to `Transfer` events on smart contracts. But follow up questions:

1. As far as I understand it is possible for a smart contract to implement the transfer methods without emitting the `Transfer` event. Not good practice but nothing stopping this from happening, which makes me think this approach of listening to the `Transfer` event might not be fool proof.

2. The transfer method and Transfer events are standardized part of ERc20 token. But I can imagine that there are other methods and operations peculiar to certain smart contracts, not standardized but that will also lead to token transfer from one EOA to another. So that means an approach of listening to just the `Transfer` event will miss these kinds of token movement.

So again the question, how can one track all events', especially token and eth transfers in and out of an EOA given the technical drawbacks I listed below?

1) First choose your DCA strategy. For this example let's convert 15 DAI to WBTC, daily, for 15 days ($225 DAI total)

2) Go to mean.finance and connect your wallet (ensure to use either Optimism, Polygon or Arbitrum for reduced tx fees)

3) Select ""Create"" along the top:

&amp;#x200B;

4) As stated in step (1), select DAI to sell,  WBTC to receive, input the total $225 DAI (15\*15=225), and then enter the period (15 days). Click continue:

5) Choose whether you'd like to your DAI and WBTC to earn yield (I would advise to untick this box, to reduce any risk), then click Create position and confirm the tx in your wallet:

6) After confirmation, click ""Positions"" along the top. Behold your newly created DCA position. At any time, clicking ""Go to position"" allows you to withdraw any and all DAI and/or WBTC in the contract. As you can see, the daily swap will execute 8 hours from position creation and, will execute at that time for the remaining days:

Let‚Äôs see where all the money is going:

*Processing img 0hunfsjcnaba1...*

**How to benefit as a farmer:**

Although I would advise waiting for the best entry point for ETH, the volume has allowed for great APRs at the moment when adding concentrated liquidity for WETH/USDC and WETH/WBTC pairs on Uniswap. By providing concentrated liquidity you‚Äôre offering your liquidity while the trading pair sits between certain price ranges:

***WETH/USDC***

*Processing img ttdui64fnaba1...*

The idea is to make the liquidity as concentrated as possible, I recommend providing a price cushion of $100 on either side of the range because if the price fluctuates beyond those bounds, the impermanent loss will eat up your gains anyway. Once you provide liquidity, watch the price daily, and remove and add your position back as necessary to adjust for ETH price changes.

*Processing img q1zl4rthnaba1...*

The same principles apply to the BTC/WETH pair but you can have a tighter price range because the price movements of BTC and ETH are similar‚Äî relatively speaking.

ethereum,"I think that web3 gaming even though it is still in its infancy, but is expanding quickly. There has been a significant increase in investment in Web3 gaming in recent years.   


I found some statistics and the entire amount spent was around $4 billion in 2021, projected to increase to $9.25 billion in 2022. It seems that 2023 will introduce even more new developments and investments in new projects.  


What do you expect from web3 and gamefi in general in 2023?  


By 2029, it is expected that the esports industry will have reached $5.48 billion. Decentralized gaming apps have a ton of potential, given the market gaps in Web2 and Web3 gaming. Additionally, there is much room for gamification in various businesses using the native Web3 incentive structures.   


There are so many projects that seem promising, CoinFantasy established a realistic gaming environment based on the crypto financial markets using an innovative approach. The use of cryptocurrencies in games has many great benefits, that's probably one of my fav things about these games.  


However, I think that as more games feature well-known people, the vision for Web3 gaming is expanding. As more people gain knowledge of the NFT user experience, more people start playing Web3 games. Celebrities and NFT creators are more aware of the ownership, transparency, and interoperability that NFTs offer.

# Questions and answers

## Why did you do this?

We are experimenting with a new application of Ethereum: **host websites directly on Ethereum**!  This brings huge benefits compared to other solutions:

* reuse Ethereum security with minimal 3rd trust
* dynamic with rich UX vs static ones
* simple user/dev onboarding with ETH wallet and dev stack (hardhat/remix/etc)

## Should it be super expensive?

Yes, uploading 40MB on the mainnet will be prohibitively expensive - even using opt. rollups are unaffordable since the data will be uploaded as mainnet calldata.

Luckily, Arbitrum Nova's DAC solves the problem, and it only takes 0.13 ETH!

## Interesting, how could I browse the website on smart contract?

The web3:// access protocol ([ERC-4804](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4804), see [https://web3url.io](https://web3url.io)) is proposed to do this.  And we have launched two gateways [http://w3link.io](http://w3link.io) and [http://w3eth.io](http://w3eth.io) to support browsing web3:// (see previous reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/zh5sc2/gateway_for_web3_evm_access_protocol_defined_in/)).

## How could I create a web3:// website for myself?

If you have local files, you can use [ethfs-uploader](https://socket.dev/npm/package/ethfs-uploader) to create an EthFS contract and upload all the local files to the contract.

You can also check [ERC-5018 Filesystem-like Interface for Smart Contracts](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5018) for more details.

## What are the next steps?

ethereum,"One great thing about leaving your money in a bank is that you get interest. USDC does not bear interest and Eth and other cryptos are risky. 

Normal people may not always want to be invested into risky assets so it seems like they can hold dollars on chain which no risk like they can in the real world - the difference is a few percent each year.  Currently I can deposit money in  bank who can buy bonds and give me interest - most of the time this can equalise inflation (admittedly not in 2022). 

If people have their money in Defi then they arent making money.  


Some examples:

1. Binance holds 30 bn in stable coins - which lose value over time. Robinhood has X dollars in a bank which gain value
2. John sells ether and doesnt want to offramp (capital gains fees etc) its a bear market so hes scared to buy so he leaves his money in USDC which losesvalue. Mary sells AAPL and leaves her money in a bank during a bear market which still yields
3. In 3 years people want to be able to accept payments/whatever on the blockchain because new smart contracts come out that are more efficient/cheaper/faster - they have no interest in investing it into risky assets due to lack of time and expertise  - they leave their money in USDC it loses value. My sandwich man downt the road accepts my payment it goes to his bank account he makes yield 
4. My grandparents want to have their savings account on the blockchain except thats a stupid idea because it makes 0 interest hence banks which make 3% which is enough for him to live off of with 1mn in his account - hence we need banks at some profound level.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

ethereum,"Hey guys, one of the customer support managers at [cryptotaxcalculator.io](https://cryptotaxcalculator.io/us/) here üëã. We get queries on this subject all the time so I thought I'd clear the air.  

**When you dispose of cryptocurrency to pay for a fee**, you may **trigger** a capital gain tax (**CGT**) **event** on the disposal value of the fee itself (depending on your tax jurisdiction of course). As a result, this capital gain/loss is realised on the difference between the acquisition and disposal price of the cryptocurrency before ""paying"" for the fee.  

As an example:  

1. You purchase 1 ETH to use for fees at the price of $1000.    
2. Some time later, you decide to mint an NFT.    
3. The gas fees for this mint are paid for in ETH and you pay a gas fee of 0.1 ETH. At the time of the sale, the price of ETH is now $2000.    
4. As a result, you've actually made a gain on the ETH itself (which was used as a gas fee). 

The reason why is because the acquisition value of the 0.1 ETH was $100 (0.1\*$1000) and the disposal value of the 0.1 ETH is $200 (0.1\*$2000). Therefore, this will **trigger a capital gains event of** $200 - $100 = **$100** for the sale of the ETH which was used for gas.  

While this may seem obvious to some, you'd be surprised how many people forget to account for this in their capital gains calculations.

ethereum,"# ‚Ä¶The Truth About CBDCs‚Ä¶ Ominous Design Revealed‚Ä¶ A Digital Prison Is Being Built in the Shadows‚Ä¶

**Massive overreach of Central Banks underway.They are designing a new kind of money allowing them to:**

* Establish centralized settlement of ALL payments‚Ä¶
* Tie digital identities to all transactions and record them on a central bank ledger forever‚Ä¶
* Force built-in features such as limits on how much CBDC you can have in your account, negative interest rates, account charges in line with regulatory objectives, and caps on conversions and spending‚Ä¶
* Create ‚Äúmoney‚Äù that is traceable, programmable, taxable, and subject to the monetary whims of central planners‚Ä¶
* Stamp out spending without permission and slowly phase out cash‚Ä¶

The war on money continues. The aim: to replace cash with a system of centralized control over ALL transactions and account balances.

This report explains exactly what to expect from Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs); it looks at the possible design options, what central banks have decided so far, and the likely outcomes.

The ugly conclusion is that CBDCs are a new form of currency that allows a small group of unelected people control over what we can, and cannot do with our own money‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;What is Going On?_

A lot has been said and written about CBDCs; most was speculation. But now, evidence emerges of what is being built.

Given that our financial system is complex, one cannot just click a button and introduce a CBDC. As of now, much work has already been done, and much is still to be done.

This report traces the historical path of the development of CBDCs. We start with looking at what CBDCs are. Then we look at why we need them, as explained by the Bank of International Settlements (**BIS**).

Next, we look at how CBDCs are designed. As the central regulator of central banks, the BIS made an inventory of all the different design options for CBDCs. It also provided an honest account of the potential benefits and downsides of those choices. With this knowledge, we can analyze the design choices made so far.

We observe how the European Central Bank (**ECB**) is going ‚Äúfull steam ahead‚Äù with their CBDC. We come to the shocking discovery that the most important design choices have already been made, and that there have even been companies hired to start programming‚Ä¶

Next, we analyze what is happening in the US. The US Federal Reserve (FED) is not as far advanced with their CBDC as the ECB. However, their frank report reveals that their CBDC design choices result in similar control mechanisms as that of the ECB‚Äîand it even exposes possible sinister motives‚Ä¶

To put it bluntly, what central banks are choosing for design so far tells us all we need to know about where this is heading. Authorities are downplaying what is going on and pretending that all is open for debate and subjected to the democratic process. But the designs they are secretly pushing forward open the door to the dystopian future we all fear‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;What Are Central Bank Digital Currencies?_

Before we can continue, we have to define CBDCs; after all, we already have digital money. But CBDCs and what we currently use as digital money are VERY different things.

What we currently refer to as digital money is not issued by the central bank. In the modern financial system, the central bank only creates money in the form of cash (bills and coins), and cash deposits with banks. All other money is created by private banks.

That‚Äôs right: the digital money currently in use is created by private institutions. The digital units in your bank account are issued by a PRIVATE bank. CBDCs, on the contrary, are digital PUBLIC money, issued by the central bank. CBDCs are a totally new kind of money‚Äïwith many new features.

To summarize, we go from two types, to three types of retail money:

1. Cash (public money = current)
2. Digital money (private money = current)
3. CBDC (public money = new)

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: ECB, Digital euro ‚Äì our future money](https://preview.redd.it/nllt4m6u8naa1.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f51c67177c3bb1a51d2f49512dd924ba6ff34b6)

Note that CBDCs are essentially just different forms of the same currency. One unit of cash is on par with one unit of CBDC; they are interchangeable. For reasons explained later, these forms of money are also intended to exist alongside each other for the foreseeable future.

To summarize: central banks are issuing a new version of money which is a liability of the central bank. As such, CBDCs are not just another form of digital money. As PUBLIC money, they are more comparable to the other form of public money: cash.

This begs the question: why do we need an addition/replacement for cash?

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Why Do We Need CBDCs? (According to Central Banks)_

There is much debate on why CBDCs are being rolled out. To avoid speculation, we will stick with what the BIS has said about why we need CBDCs. This approach helps us to understand the decisions central banks have taken, and what the logical outcome will be‚Ä¶

## Financial Stability and the Reduced Role of Public Money

Over the past few years, cash has become less popular. This presents a problem because, as shown, cash is currently the only form of public money used by the public (retail). And so when cash is phased out, so is public money.

A principal concern of central banks is that if, in the future, cash were no longer widely accepted or available, a severe financial crisis in the private financial system might create further havoc by disrupting day-to-day business and retail transactions.**1)** CBDCs would be a way to keep the economy functioning.

## Monetary Policy

Another benefit of CBDCs touted by the BIS is that they allow for a more direct influence on monetary policy. Arguments for issuing a CBDC include potential ‚Äústrengthening of the pass-through of the policy rate‚Äù to money markets and deposit rates, and helping to ‚Äúalleviate the zero (or effective) lower bound constraint.‚Äù**2)** The BIS also argues for direct stimulus. Let‚Äôs take a look at each benefit‚Ä¶

Strengthening of the pass-through of the policy rate means more control over the interest rates charged throughout the financial system. Central banks wish to bypass private banks and set rates directly. From the moment that households consider a CBDC to be an alternative to commercial bank deposits, banks will have less scope for independently setting the interest rate on deposits of the general public.**3)**

The zero lower bound describes the limit of negative interest rates. In short, in an environment of increasingly lower interest rates on bank accounts, people might pull their money out of the bank. It is, after all, better to hold cash than money in an account that charges (deep) negative interest rates.

To address this issue, the IMF circulated a paper, called ‚ÄúBreaking Through the Zero Lower Bound.‚Äù**4)** It explores the idea of having different interest rates for different forms of money. For example, an additional interest rate on cash can very easily be charged on private banks through what is known as the ‚Äúcash window‚Äù at the central bank. The central bank charges the regular banks for the use of cash, and the banks then charge the users through extra fees on withdrawals and deposits. This way, the use of cash can be made more expensive than digital forms of money.**5)**

This mechanism can be applied to steer the use of different forms of money, and even be a stepping stone on the road to a cashless society.**6)** As you‚Äôll see later, the IMF‚Äôs idea of different interest rates for different kinds of money is vigorously embraced by central banks.

For example, the Nigerian central bank used this idea to restrict cash shortly after introducing their unpopular CBDC.**7)**

And finally, according to the BIS, CBDCs could facilitate a more direct distribution of fiscal stimulus to those members of the general public who need it. This could make such policies more effective than general helicopter money or distribution through the indirect and imperfect banking channels which have been used in the past.**8)**

## Financial Inclusion

Another buzzword central banks like to use is financial inclusion. With a CBDC, everyone could have access to basic financial services. This would be especially interesting for people not served by the current financial system, which is a situation more prevalent outside the developed world.

But as always, like much else in the diversity and inclusion agenda, these rosy goals are mostly a facade. One of the most prominent organisations behind financial inclusion is the United Nations, for whom the financial inclusion agenda allows the unlocking of \*‚Äúpublic and private resources‚Äù\***9)** to fund their ‚ÄúSustainable Development Goals.‚Äù**10)** The UN, in turn, coordinates its policies through the ‚ÄúBetter Than Cash Alliance‚Äù,**11)** an NGO acting as a front for the interests of, among others, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Citi Bank, MasterCard and Visa Inc.**12)**

In this light, inclusive finance can be seen as the conversion of the unbanked into tax and debt serfs, who pay transaction fees and serve as collateral for the financial system.

## Financial innovation

The BIS is discussing all sorts of other features, all made possible by the idea of ‚Äúprogrammable money.‚Äù As we will see, most of this innovation is in the interests of central banks.

One of the promised benefits of CBDCs is that it can make international payments much more efficient and transparent. Because these kinds of liabilities are being built from scratch, CBDCs are billed as offering a unique opportunity to facilitate easier cross-border payments.**13)**

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;CBDC Design Choices_

Before we continue, it is important to note that there have been few (official) decisions made as to how to move forward. The introduction of a CBDC requires significant work, and central banks are moving slowly in order not to break anything.

In this next section, we look at the overviews the BIS has made on designing CBDCs. Lots of research has been done across academia, financial institutions and the central banks; and the BIS has created a nice summary of the design options. It also reveals what the benefits and downsides of these design choices are. With this knowledge, we can then look at the design decisions that have already been made by the ECB and FED, and hence conclude what is happening behind the scenes.

## Tokens vs Identity based

First of all, a choice has to be made as to whether the CBDC is to be token-based, or tied to an identity through an account. According to the BIS, it has to be either one or the other.

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: BIS Quarterly Review - March 2020](https://preview.redd.it/ihzthl1x8naa1.png?width=798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aaa76a447727bc8e88168b4101c32f9bb6d151b)

A token-based system would work like other crypto-currencies; those with the private keys can spend the money. But the drawbacks, according to the BIS, are severe. One is the high risk of losing funds if end users fail to keep their private key secret. Furthermore, it would be challenging to design an effective regulatory framework for such a system. Law enforcement agencies would run into difficulties when seeking to identify claim owners or follow money flows, just as with cash or bearer securities.**14)** In addition, a token system would nullify the central bank objectives discussed above.

The other option is that the use and ownership of a CBDC is accessible through an account tied to an identity, similar to how the current banking system operates. To make this happen, the BIS calls for ‚Äústrong‚Äù identities for all account holders; where each individual is tied to one identifier across the entire payment system.**15)**

The disadvantages of an account-based system, according to a 2018 paper of the BIS, are that you cannot have anonymity vis-a-vis the central bank, and there cannot be private peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary as is currently possible with cash \[see graph\].**16)**

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: BIS - Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures - CBDCs \(2018\)](https://preview.redd.it/1pxpyuw09naa1.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf5c3c5467472b281c27bfac36e393a765e42b4b)

## Direct or indirect liabilities?

The next question: should people have an account directly with the central bank, or through intermediary financial institutions? Here, the considerations are not just about what is desirable, but also what is practically feasible.

Currently, central banks simply do not have the infrastructure to hold accounts for hundreds of millions of citizens. In addition, there are regulatory obligations, such as KYC and customer due diligence, that central banks do not have the infrastructure and mandates for.**17)**

The most logical outcome would be for central banks to use the existing financial companies to roll out CBDCs. On a more technical level the question then becomes: is the CBDC to be a liability on the balance sheet of the central bank, or on the balance sheet of a financial intermediary? With the latter option, the CBDC would be an indirect liability of the central bank, also known as a ‚Äúsynthetic CBDC.‚Äù The BIS does not like this idea.**18)**

## Centralized vs Decentralized

Another choice needs to be made between using a decentralized settlement system, or a centralized one.

Firstly, for regulators, ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù does not mean the same thing as it does to the industry; they see it as a few regulated entities validating the settlement system.**19)** Moreover, regular consensus mechanisms have too much overhead and are too slow for the large number of transactions needed.**20)**

An issue the BIS has with a decentralized CBDC is that it means that a decentralized network makes adjustments to the balance sheet of the central bank. This increases the risks to the system (according to the BIS).**21)**

## Programmability

One of the main questions a central bank has to ask itself is whether it is going to create programmable money. What is programmable money? The US Federal Reserve provides a good definition:

‚Äúa digital form of money and a mechanism for specifying the automated behavior of that money through a computer program (this mechanism is termed ‚Äúprogrammability‚Äù in this note).‚Äù**22)**

Across the pond, in individual countries within the EU, the need for programmable money is being debated. However, as you will see in the following sections, programmability is an essential part of CBDCs. The ECB has even already released an API for institutions to start programming!

## Financial Stability Requirements

The fact that CBDCs are going to be exchangeable for digital currencies results in some MAJOR risks to the financial system. After all, CBDCs make it easy to pull your money out of a private institution (risk), and deposit it with the central bank (no risk).

If CBDCs could be freely traded, the moment rumors spread that a bank is having issues, all account holders will convert their account balances to CBDCs guaranteed by the central bank. You could have instant bank runs, and collapses in the financial system would happen as quickly as they do in the crypto space.

In addition, adding CBDCs increases the total amount of money in circulation, creates even more inflation at a time when people are already having problems paying their bills.

As a result, any CBDC needs a built-in mechanism to limit the amount of total CBDC that can be issued, and limit how much can be exchanged for digital currency. In short, a programmable aspect of the CBDC has to come into play. We will see later how both the ECB and Fed are already committed to using financial stability as an excuse to take full control over how CBDCs can be held, charged, and exchanged.

## Monetary Policy

One of the main activities of central banks over the last decade has been trying to manage the economy through monetary policy. Up until now, these interventions have not always been effective in kick-starting the economy. CBDCs can give the central banks, when properly designed, much more direct tools for implementing monetary policy.

## Privacy

Privacy is one of the main concerns of regulators. Or at least, it is the main concern for their potential users. So this issue has to be addressed in the design of the coin.

It is worth noting that privacy means something different for central bankers and for end users. In the crypto space, it means that the technology makes it impossible for anyone to track your purchases. From the point of view of central banks, privacy means that the organisations monitoring and facilitating your payments are under constraints as to what they can and have to do with your data.**23)**

Moreover, central banks compare the privacy of CBDCs with data-mining private financial service companies, and with transactions being done on public blockchains. They argue that in that light, public institutions are better at safeguarding privacy.**24)**

For the design of a CBDC, a central bank has to make a decision as to what level of privacy a coin will have, taking into account that full privacy is considered incompatible with other policy objectives such as KYC and AML compliance. As we will see, there are strong indications that privacy (as it is understood by the crypto industry) is not going to be built into the CBDC system.

## Interoperability

Central banks will have to make certain design choices such as whether foreigners are to be able to hold accounts with the central bank, or if there is to be some sort of exchange facility, perhaps similar to what the crypto industry calls an atomic swap.

A coordinated CBDC design effort could take a clean-slate perspective and incorporate cross-border payment options right from the start.**25)**

## Private vs public chain

On a final note, investors in existing blockchains, such as XLM or XRP, have been publicly claiming that CBDCs will be built with their chain as the base layer. This is simply NOT going to happen.

As previously mentioned, CBDCs are liabilities on the balance sheet of the central bank. There is no way that they are going to base this on an existing blockchain, because it would mean they would have to take full control over the network.

Now that we understand the different design choices available, we can look behind the scenes at how central banks are applying them‚Äïstarting with the ECB!

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;The Digital Euro; ECB Design Choices_

To understand the process of the creation of the digital Euro, we have to recap how the EU works. This is well described by Todd Huizinga, a former American diplomat to the EU. He explains in detail that the EU is run by elites who wish to create an ‚Äúever closer union,‚Äù regardless of the desires of the populations of individual EU countries.**26)**)

As a result, the EU has created a culture where policies are presented as still being debated and subject to democratic principles, whilst in fact, behind closed doors, the direction is being agreed upon in backroom deals.

The same seems to apply to the EU‚Äôs CBDC, the digital Euro. The design and building of the digital Euro is at an advanced stage, while officially nothing has been decided.

The reality however is that the issuing of the Euro, and logically also the design of the digital Euro, is delegated to the European Central banking system.**27)** And as you will see in the remainder of this section, the digital Euro train left the station a long time ago, with funding already secured and companies being hired to build the required infrastructure.

As it stands now, legislation is to be finalized in Q1 2023. And only in Q3 2023 will the decision on the digital Euro be formally approved (note that by then the design will be finished).**28)**

## The design choices of the digital Euro

In 2020 the ECB published their ‚ÄúReport on the digital Euro.‚Äù**29)** It sees the future Euro as a ‚Äúsafe digital asset with advanced functionalities‚Äù**30)** and with ‚Äúprofound implications for key areas of central banking, for the broader economic and financial system, and, ultimately, for the life of European citizens‚Äù**31)**

The digital Euro would be first of all another way to supply Euros, convertible at par with other forms of the Euro. A digital Euro will be a liability of the Eurosystem and therefore by definition risk-free central bank money.**32)**

## Programmability

The digital Euro should keep pace with state-of-the-art technology at all times in order to best address the needs of the market. Among required attributes are: usability, convenience, speed, cost efficiency and programmability. It should be made available through front-end solutions throughout the entire Euro area and should be inter-operable with private payment solutions.**33)**

Programmability is going to be required for a number of desired features. There are going to be controls on how much money can be exchanged between different forms of the Euro,**34)** different interest rates on different forms of the Euro, and limits on what one can hold and/or transact in crisis situations.**35)** There will likely be a maximum amount of CBDC which can be held by one person at no additional cost.**36)** In terms of monetary policy, the digital Euro should be remunerated at interest rate(s) that the central bank can modify over time,**37)** and with different interest rates applied in different cases.**38)**

To get an idea of how much digital Euros each account owner is allowed to own before being faced with restrictive measures (such as negative interest rates), the Dutch central bank suggests that 3.000-4.000 Euro should be enough for most Dutch citizens, as it represents one month‚Äôs living expenses and a financial buffer for unforeseen expenses(!).**39)**

Next to the account features, there is work being done on special payment instructions, such as payments done between machines.**40)** In short, the digital Euro is going to be programmable, and not in a way that improves financial freedom.

## Account Based Access and the Digital Identity

The BIS report taught us that central banks can issue a token or an account based system. The ECB, indeed, discusses both as possible options.\*\*41)\*\*A pure bearer (token) system, as exemplified by regular crypto currencies, would take away the control of the ECB. Thus, according to the ECB, such a system can only be allowed when both users are uniquely identified, for example with biometrics, e.g. fingerprint and iris recognition.**42)**

The account-based system, on the other hand, would be operated in the same way as the current banking system. This is the preferred system of the ECB, where they operate the back-end while (existing) supervised intermediaries operate the front-end.**43)** As we see shortly, financial service providers have already been hired to build this system.

As we speak, the infrastructure for the digital Euro is being built, along with an EU-wide digital ID. This digital ID, governed by the eIDAS Regulation,**44)** aims to help business, citizens and public authorities carry out electronic interactions. This digital ID will contain your relevant data, such as name, address, biometrics, driver‚Äôs licence, medical data, and will be used to facilitate transactions, open bank accounts, (online) shopping, financial services (such as insurance) and God knows what else. This digital ID was approved in early December 2022 (but, like the CBDC, was already being built and funded long before that).

## Central or Decentralized Control

The ECB‚Äôs 2020 report repeats the BIS‚Äôs options of having a decentralized settlement system. However, the ECB is not going for this model; they state that the central bank will control the back-end, and has control over all the units that are to be created.**45)**

## Other Possible Features

Other design options are discussed, such as the possibility for hardware ‚Äúwearables‚Äù,**46)** virtual cards with additional features such as shorter expiration date and spending limits, and a pan-European merchant solution.**47)**

## Privacy only for ‚Äúlow-value transactions‚Äù

The above statement is from a more recent letter by Fabio Panetta, the driving force behind the digital Euro. According to him, the ECB will explore if they can ‚Äúallow‚Äù some anonymity in the system.**48)**

The ECB is addressing privacy in response to a public consultation where the ECB asked European citizens what they thought of a European CBDC. It received an avalanche of negative responses, and privacy was the most cited worry.**49)**

But the statements of the ECB on privacy are contradictory. In public, officials tout it as an important feature. But if you then look at their most recent internal presentation on privacy they explain that ‚Äúuser anonymity is not a desirable feature, as this would make it impossible to control the amount in circulation and to prevent money laundering.‚Äù**50)**

The truth is that a gradual shift to digital payments implies ‚Äúless privacy by default.‚Äù The ECB suggests that the digital Euro should be designed so that the Eurosystem should only be able to see the ‚Äúminimum transaction data.‚Äù**51)** However, they are settling the transaction and will need to know who is paying what to whom. It is quite clear that privacy is not built into the system.

The ECB suggests that some privacy can be allowed for certain ‚Äúlow-value payments‚Äù and ‚Äúoffline functionality.‚Äù However, ‚Äúhigher-value transactions would remain subject to standard controls.‚Äù**52)**

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Programming the European CBDC: ECB Software Package_

On the 7th of December 2022, the ECB published a package for financial intermediaries to start building applications for the digital Euro.

The publication contained cover letters confirming the design choices discussed above, but also a software package with the Application Programming Interface (API), a set of defined rules that explain how the computers of banks are to communicate with those of the central bank.**53)**

[Source: ECB Website, Digital Euro API package](https://preview.redd.it/e105ovs59naa1.png?width=804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=420fe43a79fdf745b8726f7642ebb4cb4b173ed7)

This package provides a programming standard for banks and payment providers that serve the general public; it allow them to process payments digitally, while the Eurosystem settles the payments.

The ECB is testing a system where intermediaries get to program different kinds of transactions. Five companies have been selected to build software integrations on a settlement layer hosted by the ECB. Each will test a different type of transaction.**54)**

As an Annex to the article, one can download the code of the actual API.**55)** From the source code, a number of additional conclusions can be drawn about the model currently being pursued:

* The digital Euro will have intermediaries deal with clients, and the ECB ultimately settling all the transactions. The intermediary creates the payment, the Eurosystem approves, and then a callback confirms the details of the transaction, with details on the time and date it settled.
* Despite the non-stop bashing of Bitcoin by the ECB, the current proposal uses the same technology (UTXO, pub/private signatures) and even the same security model (secp256k1) as Bitcoin. The ECB is literally creating a Bitcoin rip-off and may even be re-using open source Bitcoin code‚Ä¶
* The ECB will respond to every payment request with either ‚ÄúSETTLED‚Äù or ‚ÄúFAILED.‚Äù Meaning that it has the ultimate control over what payments do and do not get approval. It is unclear what conditions would result in a failed payment.  
Given the large number of transactions the ECB will have to process, and the risk of running complex software at a settlement layer, it is hard to imagine the ECB programming payment conditions for specific cases.  
However, running a payment through a sanctions list, or a list with basic conditions might be feasible. Moreover, it seems likely that programming features will be enforced at the layers above the settlement layer. For example, the ECB is working on a ‚ÄúDedicated programmability platform layer‚Äù between the settlement layer and the intermediary layers.**56)**

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: ECB, Programmable payments in digital euro](https://preview.redd.it/prt02rza9naa1.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9975507329d2f4d8715a24eedde14b69ac888a6)

* The documentation explains how intermediaries create wallet addresses on behalf of their clients. It is only this address the ECB sees. The more sensitive account details are kept with the financial service provider. This is explained as safeguarding privacy. However, a permanent record of all transactions is stored. All the ECB needs to do is match a name to each address, and it sees everything.

It is as of yet unclear how monetary and financial stability objectives are going to be coded into this system. It also is not clear how the ECB aims to reconcile the contradiction of limits on account balance and their privacy goals.

The latest ECB progress update does not alleviate these worries; it states that for online payments the Eurosystem itself will record transactions AND perform associated verification tasks.**57)** And it happens to be that online payments are the category of payments with ‚Äúthe broadest set of high-level use cases.‚Äù**58)**

Now ask yourself: how large a share of payments in a digital currency will be done ‚Äúonline?‚Äù

In any case, it is safe to assume there is not going to be real privacy in this system, because with this design either the central bank or the intermediary knows the identity of the users behind each transaction.

&amp;#x200B;

## US Federal Reserve Design of the Digital Dollar_

Compared to the ECB, the American Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, is not as far advanced with designing their CBDC. However, in January 2022, the Fed did release their report ‚ÄúMoney and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation.‚Äù**59)**

In the opening paragraphs, the FED repeats the familiar take that CBDCs are a different kind of money compared to existing forms, and states that in their opinion a CBDC is a ‚Äúdigital liability of the Federal Reserve that is widely available to the general public.‚Äù It would be the ‚Äúsafest digital asset available to the general public, with no associated credit or liquidity risk.‚Äù**60)**

The report points to the fact that the Federal Reserve Act does not allow direct Federal Reserve accounts for individuals. The FED will therefore have to adopt an intermediary model where the private sector would offer accounts or digital wallets to facilitate the management of CBDC holdings and payments. Just as with the ECB, you will NOT have an account directly with the FED. But although commercial banks and non-banks would offer these services to individuals, the CBDC itself would be a liability of the Federal Reserve.**61)**

Further on, the FED argues that a future CBDC should be intermediated, widely transferable, and identity-verified, while at the same time being privacy protected.**62)** These are, again, contradicting objectives.

As a use case, the FED notes that governments could use a CBDC to collect taxes or make benefit payments directly to citizens. Additionally, a CBDC could potentially be programmed to, for example, deliver payments at certain times.**63)** Again, programmable money.

Additionally, a CBDC could potentially be used to carry out micro-payments, and streamline cross-border payments by using new technologies.**64)**

Crucially, the FED recaps the risk unlimited use of CBDCs poses to the stability of the financial system. As such, the FED also proposes the variation of interest rates on different kinds of money and limits on the amount an end user could hold.**65)** Moreover, to prevent a flight to safety, it proposes limits to the amount a user could accumulate in a short period of time.**66)**

And last, but not least, the FED discusses its monetary policy and the need to expand its balance sheet to accommodate CBDC growth. Part of this could be mitigated by shifting away from existing ‚Äúnon reserve liabilities.‚Äù**67)**

‚Ä¶Yes, the FED is suggesting withdrawing cash to make room for CBDCs‚Ä¶

## New York Fed Testing of Wholesale CBDCs

There were a number of recent headlines reporting that the New York Fed had started a 12-week test of their first CDBC.**68)** However, this project is mostly about exploring the concept of a ‚Äúwholesale CBDC.‚Äù This is a form of CBDC that is only used to settle the liabilities of regulated financial institutions. Although interesting, it does not tell us much about the future of retail CBDCs which are the main subject of this report.

## Fednow Payment System

Fednow is another project under development by the FED that is sometimes confused with a CBDC. This facility will enable individuals and businesses to send instant payments between accounts.**69)** While the idea of instant settlement reminds us of crypto currency, what is settled are not central bank liabilities. As such, Fednow is not a CBDC system.

&amp;#x200B;

## &lt;Conclusion: The CBDC Prison Being Built_

Central banks around the world have started building CBDCs. These need to be designed, and each design has consequences. When looking at the design choices made so far, we can see where things are headed. And it doesn‚Äôt look good‚Ä¶

As of now, no formal decisions have been made in the jurisdictions discussed. Regardless, the EU‚Äôs direction seems clear. Perhaps the US Congress still has a say in the future of money. We shall see.

What we see in the works is a system where small groups of unelected people get to approve all payments. There will be no privacy. It has purposefully designed features that control how much money you can hold and what kind of charges and (negative) interest rates apply. A system of constant surveillance, and the centralization of sensitive information.

And then we haven‚Äôt even talked about all the other policies increasingly being enforced through the financial system, such as a personal Co2 budget**70)** (or other social credit systems), the re-directing of private resources towards public policy goals (blended finance),**71)** and the exclusions of political undesirables.**72)**

CBDCs replace cash with a kind of money you never legally own, you can directly be charged interest and fees on, and cannot spend without permission.

# TLDR:

**CBDCs are liabilities directly with the central bank. They are a new kind of money. Next to cash and digital money currently held in private banks.**

**The Bank of International Settlements made an overview of all research into CBDCs. It shows that each design has consequences.**

**The ECB has chose for a design where intermediaries deal with the clients, but the ECB settles all payments. There is no real privacy in the system. To ensure financial stability, the ECB wishes to maintain control over account balances, apply variable (interest) charges, and monetary policy/stimulus. The digital Euro is in a far stage of development.**

**The Federal Reserve Act forces the FED to go through intermediaries as well. The digital USD will be programmable and identity-verified. To ensure financial stability, the FED wishes to maintain controls on interest charges and maximum account balances. The FED also argues that CBDCs might have to replace cash to maintain a healthy balance sheet. The digital USD appears to NOT be in a far stage of development.**","‚Ä¶The Truth About CBDCs‚Ä¶ Design Choices by ECB &amp; FED Analysed‚Ä¶ Both Are Aiming At Tight Control Over Accounts, Interest and Spending...

Reserve Protocol is an Ethereum-based permissionless platform to launch and govern asset-backed stable currencies.

The protocol went live in October, and we have undertaken four independent audits during our launch months (Solidified, Trail of Bits, Halborn, Ackee).

Safety and lack of exploitation in our smart contracts is our number 1 priority, and our Code4 Audit is our last step towards All Clear 

I'm hoping on behalf of the team that any Ethereum experts in this sub will come along and help push this final step forward, in return for potential awards from the $210,500 USDC prize pool.

https://code4rena.com/contests/2023-01-reserve-contest

Once we announce our All Clear, anyone (including your good self), can create an asset-backed currency, using around ~50 RWAs / protocols as backing.

So far $300m a month moves through our protocol through the RPay app, predominantly in Latin America, predominantly non-crypto people using us in shops, for payroll, for remittance, and other everyday uses.

Our aim eventually is to give everyone the right to hold stable currency that retains its purchasing power over years, always on-chain 24/7, fully-backed, governed and diversified.

But first we want this fifth audit to validate every line of code, before we ask people to trust large amounts of capital in us.

If you are an auditor, hacker, or know your way around smart contracts, please come and find us!

# What is Arbitrum?

Arbitrum is a layer-2 solution and a project that aims to improve the performance and scalability of Ethereum smart contracts, as well as add privacy features. It allows developers to use Ethereum‚Äôs virtual machine and transactions at a second layer, while maintaining the security provided by the first layer.

# Will there be an Airdrop for the Community?

Speculation about the Arbitrum token airdrop is at a peak due to the high level of Total Value Locked (TVL) and active user statistics. This speculation was fueled by a tweet from the co-founder of OffchainLabs, the company behind Arbitrum.

I'd assumed that the companies that would use censoring relays would be the very US-law-encumbered ones, like Coinbase and Kraken. But that's not what we see. Those companies are down in the ""profit-maximizing"" section. The companies that we see listed are:

 * ""Hacked"", basically defunct defi platforms: Stakehound and Cream Finance
 * A history of fraud and/or bankrupt: BitFinex and Celsius
 * Binance, which is known for not being overly troubled by US regulations. (I don't have an opinion on whether they're fraudulent or not, but personally it's not the kind of place I'd feel comfortable leaving my money overnight.)

Basically when a financial institution wants to invest in another country, they have to carry out a currency swap so that they‚Äôre investing in the country‚Äôs fiat currency. It‚Äôs incredible hard for auditors to keep track of currency swaps. Huge blind spot, especially since currency swaps account for 80 some trillion dollars. For perspective, global GDP is roughly 100 trillion and US GDP is roughly 25 trillion. 

To be honest, I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hard to audit currency swaps, but I take the BIS‚Äôs word on authority with this shot over the bow. I‚Äôm not preaching a doomsday thesis, but more so express the possibility that something could go seriously wrong with this situation; given how much money we‚Äôre talking about, and humans being humans and their penchant for corruption, currency swaps could be a source of distress in the future should there be unsavory players meddling in the pot. We‚Äôre not talking FTX level money here with a few billion. Blind spots on the scale of a few billion is bad. Blind spots on the scale of tens of trillions might prove to be the biggest instance of gross negligence in human history. That opens the possibility for something to go seriously wrong.

ethereum,"I've been an investor in the stock market for many years now, things I've learned through experience is not to invest in a stock or ETF, but to invest in the product or the company itself. That's the thought process behind it.

Vitalik Buterin has an IQ of 257, which makes sense giving how he talks on podcasts. His sheer knowledge and dedication to the tech field, Eth, crypto, and blockchain is immense. When I buy my $50 of Ethereum every Friday, I'm investing in Vitalik. I trust his guidance, his roadmap, and the fact that he's turned down banks on a weekly basis is astonishing. I feel like he's part android, there's videos where he talks for minutes without blinking.

I live in Canada so I use Wealthsimple and being a stock market investor, I don't actually intend to use Ethereum for it's main purpose of storing on a cold wallet or utilizing its ability. I buy my shares of it and I will just hold it as an investment. We can stake Eth now so I will be doing that eventually which I'm excited for because it's basically ethereum paying me dividends.

Regardless, I think long term Ethereum will run computing defi on the planet. Visa is already talking with them!

ethereum,"Would love some feedback on something of a business idea I was considering.So if you look back through my post history, you'll see that I generally like to help people in crypto where possible with any problems that they have in crypto. It's a jungle out there and people are always there to take advantage of people. I enjoy helping people and I think there are plenty of beginners that would love to get into the space but don't know how or where to get started.

Now, I fully realise people are going to call this a scam and I'd find it very hard to ever get something like this off the ground however, I'd love to get some feedback from actual crypto users on the idea.

1. I won't be offering any sort of financial advice.
2. I would advise people on particular coins or airdrops if that particular person asked for any feedback on whether they look legitimate or not (based off num of holders, any online feedback or scam reports etc.). Regardless of any token looking legitimate, I would be carefully wording any response that any action is taken of their own decision.
3. Would help educate people, they can ask me any questions on crypto etc. I'd be happy to create videos or articles on concepts that might confuse you or that you're interested in learning more about.
4. Help with recovery or support issues. For e.g. in [r/Metamask](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/) you constantly see people withdraw a wrapped token on another chain and can't find the deposit to their wallet, I would help guide them to viewing the funds in their wallet, and ultimately, getting them back on the chain they actually intended to withdraw on. Or better yet, this person would be reaching out to me initially and I could offer them some pros and cons on the options available and they ultimately choose accordingly.

Now, obviously I'm in pretty early stages here of thinking about this if I'm coming to Reddit to ask for feedback however, does anyone have any feedback on this idea, or can you tell me what you would expect or like to see from this service? And how much would you pay monthly?

I'd obviously offer some assurances over getting back to you in a particular timeframe but would anyone ever pay for something that isn't offering you x100 gains and scamming you out of your hard earned money.

I get that people are going to think I'm just going to scam people but that aside, would this ever be something that you or someone you know would go for?",Would you ever pay for a personal crypto friend?,1.0,1,103i0zk,lovelybittabusiness,0,2023-01-04 23:01:03,1672873279,1672873279,2023-01-04,23:01:03

I have no experience buying.  I mistakenly bought Weth Etherium and not Polygon. because at the time of purchase I was in the hospital ward because I received stroke treatment on the left hand.  Because I am interested in avatars, I don't want to miss  buy avatars because there are people selling avatars for 0.05 ETH.  due to my carelessness I did not see properly, I mistakenly took Weth Etherium.

The avatar costs 0.05 ETH (Polygon).  I have added 0.05 WETH Etherium on metamask.  Therefore the purchase cannot be done.  I have tried to convert on metamask but need to make a conversion from Weth Etherium -&gt; to ETH Etherium on the same network first.  After I got ETH Etherium currency and I can bridge to ETH Polygon.  that's what i'm trying to do.  because no other way is allowed in metamask.  I have already tried to convert a small amount but was unsuccessful because I need to have a small amount of Gas fees in ETH Etherium currency first so that the transaction is successful.  This cost requires around 1 Dollar.  

what I see Now I can only transfer the Weth Etherium to ETH Etherium and it requires Gas fees 1 Dollar.  I don't have Eth for the fee because all my money is in WETH and I can't transfer.  and after this transfer is completed,  I can bridge this to ETH polygon.

I'd really to be able to do 4 operations:

1. `make_transaction`: This would take three inputs - the `from_address_in_hex`, the `to_address_in_hex`, and the `amount` \- and output an `unsigned_transaction_in_hex`.
2. `submit_transaction`: This would take an input of a `signed_transaction_in_hex` and output details on which block it was included in.
3. `print_transaction`: This would take either an `unsigned_transaction_in_hex` or a `signed_transaction_in_hex` as input and output a human-readable ASCII version of all transaction fields.
4. `sign_transaction`: This wold take a `unsigned_transaction_hex` and a `private_key_hex` as inputs and output a `hex_signed_transaction`.

Operations 3 and 4 need to be able to run disconnected from the internet. Operation 1 and 2 need the internet, the former so it can look up the correct nounce and choose parameters related to gas prices for the transaction.

ethereum,"Hello guys, I‚Äôm new to the sub but has been writing Web3 off-chain back-end code for a over a year now.

I‚Äôm looking for Ethereum contract + topics combination that is guaranteed to emit at least 1 event log (or very few, but preferably just 1) every block for testing my library code.

So do you guys know of any such contracts? Thank you!

If you want to know why I need event log, it‚Äôs because because the Go library I‚Äôm writing centers around it being event log polling building blocks with real-time chain reorganization detection and handling baked in. To detect chain reorg while only getting information from event logs, I use log‚Äôs block hash and will only fetch block headers (for block hashes) if there‚Äôs a reorg and a log disappeared from the block. So that‚Äôs why I need event log for block hash and not the block header.

It is now done and will soon be open sourced, so I‚Äôm writing examples for devs. One of the examples is a single-file chain reorg monitor service. So I need a contract and topics that would make the example seems reasonable and cheapest to run, hence the question.

ethereum,"Hi! I have this particular use case and would like to share it, so people can recommend any solution besides building the solution myself, so here it is:

I want to keep some USDC or BUSD under a multi-sign wallet which requires 2 signatures to spend the funds (2 of 2 signatures), but, I can see a couple of issues with only having 2 parties and needing 2 signatures to perform anything with any funds in that multi-sign, first: death, second: separation of the parties involved and a need to return funds to each party.

Death: if one of the two parties dies during the duration of this trust of funds(?), the remaining party needs to go through and recover the other party's wallet to do anything with the funds, which is an annoyance at best.

Separation: let's say any of the involved parties want to stop putting money into this trust fund (again: is that the name of this thing?) and leave with their corresponding share of the money, but the other party doesn't want to sign anything, which freezes the funds until the dispute is settled and worst-case scenario none of the parties does what the other part asks, and a judge gets involved to resolve the conflict.

Then, some solutions come to mind solving both particular edge-cases at the same time: involving a third party that plays the role of arbitrator, it could be a lawyer who represents both parties... but these cost money, and you need to trust the lawyer to do The Right Thing‚Ñ¢.

To me, what comes to mind is a smart contract, is cheaper than a lawyer, and you can write one (if you know what you are doing) to do The Right Thing‚Ñ¢, but a smart contract can control 100% of the funds and do whatever N-of-M signatures requests, right? I wonder if a smart contract can be a signer party in a multi-sign wallet, my reasoning for that is that the ""N-of-M+smart contract"" signers control 100% of the funds, if someone smarter than the person writing the contract want to exploit a bug, the attacker won't get anything of value because he still needs other signers to participate in the ""hack"" (2 of the 3 signers in this case).

Okay, so the question: is there something like this out there in Ethereum that can be used for cheap and with a frontend that won't banish suddenly, or do I need to build it myself?",A piggy-bank with stablecoins in Ethereum using multi-signature wallets?,1.0,1,zzlf83,shackra,0,2022-12-31 04:33:31,1672461226,1672461226,2022-12-31,04:33:31

ethereum,"An EIP can be submitted by anyone, and becomes the responsibility of the author once they‚Äôre created. The author informs other developers of their proposal, gathers support to build and launch it, and documents work throughout the process.

The majority of EIPs are Standards Track EIPs, proposals that change the Ethereum protocol itself. Broadly, anything that technically changes Ethereum is a Standards Track EIP. There are several sub-types under the Standards Track: 

\- Core

\- Network 

\- Interface 

\- ERC

&amp;#x200B;

Core EIPs

[Core EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/core) are changes drastic enough to require a fork in the blockchain. Forks are when the blockchain splits in two because of a major decision, with one path following the old rules and the new path following the new ones.

Networking EIPs

[Networking EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/networking) are improvements to nodes communication and transactions are transmitted on Ethereum. Transactions are encrypted when sent; when I send you funds, I'm encrypting a message that only you can decrypt. Changes to these aspects are Networking EIPs.

Interface EIPs

[Interface EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/interface) are improvements for how applications interact with Ethereum. They standardize the API used for communication with the blockchain. An example is [EIP-6](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6), which changed an opcode on Ethereum from ‚ÄúSuicide‚Äù to ‚ÄúSelf-Destruct‚Äù for mental health reasons.

ERC EIPs

Finally, [ERC EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc) establish new standards on Ethereum, often for smart contracts. These standards are responsible for tokens on Ethereum ([ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)) and non-fungible tokens ([ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)) and many more. Without these standards, tokens wouldn‚Äôt be easily tradeable.

Additional EIP Types

Standard Track EIPs (the ones listed above) are the most common. The less frequent [Meta EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/meta) covers non-technical changes in process; how development overall is managed. Finally, instead of proposing new features, [Informational EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/informational) elaborate on existing design details.

&amp;#x200B;

THE EIP Approval Process

[EIP-1](https://preview.redd.it/ey5cgm7lk29a1.jpg?width=1705&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f6e5ed26737c6d890f69c14653f7aa489da4ae5)

EIPs can be proposed by anyone, but often require the work of multiple people depending on their impact. [EIP Editors](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5069) review EIPs that are submitted, and multiple developers are usually required to build a feature. 

The effort to reward ratio factors greatly into which proposals are prioritized and which aren‚Äôt. They all follow an identical process that determines which EIPs get delivered first.

Before submitting an EIP, authors should first [vet the idea with others](https://ethereum-magicians.org) in the Ethereum development community. Assuming the idea is not covered by an existing EIP, the author creates a draft and submits it to the EIP Editors. 

There are different EIP Editors responsible for each sub-type of EIP; they‚Äôre responsible for making sure the proposals are technically sound. Once that‚Äôs done, they create the Draft version of the EIP.

Once an EIP Editor feels like the draft is ready to receive feedback from the community, they move it from being in Draft to in Review. At this stage, any member of the Ethereum development community can share their thoughts on how the proposal can be improved.

Once complete, the EIP enters the Last Call stage. This provides a final opportunity for feedback to be shared, usually within 14 days. If any major changes come up, the proposal moves back to Review. If no major feedback arises, then the EIP moves into the Final stage.

Once an EIP is Final, it becomes a candidate to include in Ethereum‚Äôs periodic upgrades (called forks). The process highlights the importance of individual responsibility in a decentralized environment. 

No features would be delivered if not championed by at least one person to start, and each is only made complete through the process of peer-review. 

May the brightest ideas win.

ethereum,"Arbitrum has recently brought up a discussion on Medium about [Delay Attacks on Rollups](https://offchain.medium.com/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a). In short, their post raises an important issue that affects all optimistic rollups that are based on interactive verifications, such as Optimism, Arbitrum, Cartesi, Truebit, etc.

In short, although the attack does not compromise the security of the rollups chain, it allows a well-funded party to delay its finality by continuously burning collaterals for the duration of the attack.

This news could have been worrisome, since it affects several different protocols. However, Delay Attacks are far from an unsurmountable problem.

First of all, Arbitrum itself has announced in their article that they know a solution to the problem. They have announced a new protocol to be published soon, which is already being implemented.

On another front, Cartesi‚Äôs contributors have also worked to tackle this Delay Attack and they have just published a solution to the issue in this [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12439).

In summary, under Cartesi‚Äôs proposal, a team of dishonest parties with x funds can be defeated in a single dispute by an honest player who is willing to deposit log(x) funds. This makes Delay Attacks impossible and sibling attacks impractical.

This algorithm is a novel, stronger primitive for building permissionless fraud-proof protocols, which doesn‚Äôt rely on complex economic incentives to be enforced.

ethereum,"Hi all,

A little over a week ago, I tried to purchase some ETH via the ‚ÄúTop Up‚Äù interface on the Torus wallet website, using the MoonPay option. As you can see, in *both* the drop down menu &amp; well as the left sidebar, the 3 crypto currency options to choose from with MoonPay, as presented on the Torus website, are ETH, MATIC, and USDC.

As this is my first time making such a purchase, I was extra thorough in checking every confirmation page &amp; email I was presented with, to make sure that the currency selected is ‚ÄúETH‚Äù, as I had wanted to make sure I didn‚Äôt accidentally purchase MATIC.

‚Ä¶Which made it all the more shocking to me when MoonPay seems have sent me WETH???? WETH wasn‚Äôt even an option to choose from via the methods/interface I used, so I fail to see how this could have even been user (my) error?

Here is the polyscan link to the transaction

I submitted a support request on MoonPay‚Äôs website, and received no reply after 8 days.

(I did receive an automated email immediately after submitting the support request, saying they typically respond within 24 hours, excluding holidays, etc.)

If you want to read it, here is the message I submitted to MoonPay support (along with many of the screenshots in this post). No new information I haven‚Äôt already mentioned above, though, so you can probably skip over reading it.

So after 8 days, I sent a DM to u/MoonPaySupport on twitter, and got this reply.

Note, that was &amp; to this day still is, my first &amp; only crypto currency related transaction I‚Äôve ever done with that wallet, or any other wallet. That is, in fact, the first crypto wallet I ever had. So it‚Äôs quite literally impossible that I had done anything else in the past with my account/wallet/history that was against their terms &amp; conditions. I have literally never had *any* crypto currency in my possession/ownership until that WETH they seem to have mistakenly sent me instead of the ETH I had purchased from them.

With all that said \[thank you, sincerely if you read through this far\], my questions are:

1. Am I correct in understanding that I should have received ETH and not WETH? There actually is an issue here, right?
2. Given that u/MoonPaySupport said ‚ÄúThis decision is final and we won't be able to provide any further assistance on this matter.‚Äù It seems I have zero course of action to take in regards to getting the ETH I paid for from them?
3. Any recommendations for where I can reliably/safely purchase some ETH, ideally not from an exchange where I need to submit a bunch of documents to open an account? I am Canadian / credit card has Canadian address, if that makes a difference. My resistance towards submitting documents to open an account with an exchange isn‚Äôt because I am trying to remain anonymous or anything, but because ALL I WANT right now is enough ETH to pay for some gas fees to transfer some NFTs out of my Torus wallet, and opening an account with an exchange seems so ‚Äúexcessive‚Äù/so much work (yet here I am typing out this long ass post).

Thank you so much for any help / insight any of you can provide.","Help please / I am Confused: I bought ETH from MoonPay, but received WETH instead.

ethereum,"I have this question in my mind, as i hear fear of ETH being more Centralized as one of the reason being few Validators control majority of Staked ETH (coinbase, Binance etc).

As Ethereum network being merged to POS many long term Hodlers are adding ETH to stake them (15M+ staked). 

I do notice that there is a strong need for being Self Validator rather in Dec/Cen Pools like LIDO,Coinbace etc. And its not easy rather simple to become validator and Stake with 32 ETH.

There fore i have a suggestion OR proposal to bring it to Ethereum Devs.

1- Try to bring a Mobile (Mini Hard drive) Device (Preconfigured) and could be become single or Multiple Validator node's with Extension to Mobile APP to control.

2- This device with the size of an Iphone connects with WIFI/LAN, bluetooth/ USB Charging etc.

3- Reduce collateral limit from 32 ETH to 8 ETH OR Less. this way more Young investors will start there own Validator nodes.

ethereum,"While headlines focus on declining token prices, blockchain technology is doing fine and attracts record levels of users, investment, and interest from mainstream organizations.  


Global payment provider VISA recently showed its intentions with web3 infrastructure and blockchain, with a heavy focus on security, scalability, interoperability, and privacy. At the same time, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, one of the world's leading investment, advisory, and risk management firms, declared that open, decentralized ledgers would be an integral part of the global economy's future.  


From the beginning, I believed that blockchain tech will make great changes for many industries.   


I'm super excited to see how will all of this development in the near future, there are already some great predictions for the next year considering the Flare blockchain, for example, that aims to create a true cross-chain reality by ‚ÄúConnecting Everything.‚Äù using decentralized systems or there's tech startup Banger Games wants to open up new opportunities for gamers by becoming the first hub to reward players for their in-game and community activity, regardless of the game, publisher, or platform they do this on. Simply put, gamers will be able to receive rewards for playing leading online games such as PUBG &amp; Counter-Strike.  


This year my greatest revelation was Elan Future, a blockchain-based system that can send power to anyone, anywhere in seconds, allowing for a direct and seamless energy transfer without middlemen, fees, or restrictions. This project allows anyone to participate in energy production, implying that energy democratization has finally arrived.  


I am aware that the metaverse is becoming a buzzword for Web3, while genuinely decentralized finance bubbles to the top after the collapse of several centralized exchanges.

ethereum,"Look I don't usually like to dunk on projects, but Status came out of the 2017 bull market with almost $100M in capital, and frankly I'm shocked this team has failed to produce anything, let alone a usable standard for Ethereum based messaging that's safe. Everything on paper has pretty much said Status should be a dominant messenger. We had in the past year with covid:

- Multiple political turmoil that should have allowed Status to become mainstream as an effective privacy tool
- A great bull run catalyst that could have captured more users
- An entire NFT ecosystem that uses chat and token gating tools

Yet, in every case, Status completely fumbled with effective marketing and strategy. To this day, there's no incentive to run nodes, no reason to use it as a wallet since its mostly clunky and doesn't natively support L2s, and even your top tier Ethereum users just don't use it.

What is wrong with this team? I feel like it's in a position to really get major use and be a great mainstream wallet, yet teams like Rainbow and even Argent have captured more users. I frankly think it's embarrassing that in our ecosystem, we have to defer to horrifying alternatives for private chat like Discord and Telegram instead of using an Eth native alternative, yet here we are outsourcing to insecure options because Status cannot even get a product out the door even after being given $100M. Whatever happened to adding this chat layer onto nodes to help boost adoption? Whatever happened to the update that was supposed to happen months ago? Whatever happened to the desktop client? Whatever happened to the team ""dogfooding"" the app and being responsive on Status chat rooms, who are now basically running all comms in Discord at this point? This team barely managed to even be present at their table at devcon

I'm sorry but I think there needs to be some serious public shaming right now to get this team to either reorganize and fire it's leads, or at least do some amount of work to get a product out the door. If Ethereum wants to be more mainstream, we should at least promote a secure web3 chat product that could be useful in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan.

- What event is triggered when normal transfer of Eth from one account to another account occurs?
- What example are there on how to subscribe to these events using the JSON_RPC endpoints? Is subscribing to ERC20 token events different from subscribing to normal Ethereum transfer?

Because of this connectivity, game creators may now design and release blockchain-powered games, offering users unparalleled control over the gaming experience.

Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in the dApp market was up to 90% before other rival platforms were created.  


Ethereum is still the undisputed king of dApps. Despite its high fees, the platform is still the first choice for different applications, ranging from finance, exchanges, and storage to gaming, NFTs, and governance.   


This shows how far it has come since its whitepaper was published in 2013, it seems like it was yesterday, times definitely flies.  


Like everything else, Ethereum started as an idea. And unlike Bitcoin, which was only intended for financial usage, the aim was to employ blockchain technology to create decentralized applications. This was the idea of Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin, who is of Russian descent.  


Today, we may even receive free renewable energy thanks to blockchain tech, if you look at projects like Elan Future; all of these things appeared so far away just a few years ago. I think that it's incredible how much tech evolved.  


Like everything else ETH had its ups and downs through all these years, but I'm super excited to see how will it evolve in upcoming years, especially because the upgrade is expected to be fully implemented around 2024 or beyond.

ethereum,"Have you heard about Visa's most recent revelation that it is working to implement auto-payments on Ethereum through the development of a novel wallet type‚Äîa procedure dubbed ""account abstraction"" by the company?  


According to what I've heard, Visa did in fact issue a technical paper in which it looked into the idea of creating an automatic payment mechanism for Ethereum self-custodial wallets.  


I find it amazing what we can all do with the help of modern technologies, cryptocurrencies, and other things.  


In addition to the payment systems, the ticketing industry, and other things, blockchain may also prevent the production of free clean energy. I also think that the energy sector will use blockchain in the near future. The amount of electricity needed to meet the world's energy needs, as well as the effects of the global community on the climate and the cost of energy, might be greatly reduced thanks to this cutting-edge technology, claims Elan Future.  


Enabling auto-payments for self-custodial wallets is difficult in light of the recent Visa and ETH news, as doing so may require granting access to one's private keys to a smart contract that will be making the payments on their behalf. In essence, auto-payments have the potential to jeopardize the security offered by self-custody.  


The process of confirming a transaction on the blockchain would apparently become more flexible as a result of all of this, in my opinion.

I am the founder of DEEP 42, a decentralized entertainment and engagement platform that is built on the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for data storage.

I am excited to introduce DEEP 42 to the community and to share more about our vision for the platform and the games that we are creating.

One of the key features of DEEP 42 is the play-to-earn model, which allows players to earn governance tokens through gameplay and participate in key governance votes. These tokens, which are based on the ERC-20 standard, can be used to influence decisions related to DEEP 42's operations, financial incentives, development, and balance of the game worlds.

Our first game, which will be released in the coming months, is a ""tamagotchi-inspired"" game in which players care for and grow their own characters. These characters are dynamic NFTs that have attributes such as strength, health, dexterity, speed, rarity, and visual representation, which are stored on the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS.

In addition to this care game, we are also developing a turn-based battle system that will allow players to battle against each other using the characters that they have nurtured. And we have big plans for even more games in the future.

We believe that DEEP 42 has the potential to change the way that people interact with and participate in the gaming industry, and we are committed to involving the community in the development and direction of the platform.

ethereum,"I have been thinking a lot lately about key management and fund recovery. It occurred to me that we could create a system that allows us to recover funds from lost keys by signing time bound transactions which can sweep our funds in the event that we lose access.

In a nutshell, this works by signing a transaction that deploys a contract which sends funds to another address (this could be a friend, family member or even your exchange) and setting time constraints such as not valid before and/or not valid after. You can also sign many of these transactions with multiple nonce values so that you still have a valid transaction in the event that you make future transactions.

Since this signed transaction is constrained to the recipient and certain time criteria, it is not sensitive and can be stored anywhere, including on the cloud. As a user you have the power to invalidate the transactions at anytime by either spending the funds or using up all the nonces.

ethereum,"EOF is the biggest upgrade in the EVM's history. Coming in the Shanghai fork in March, EOF will completely change how Ethereum works. Here's a summary.  


EIP-3540  
The first upgrade in EOF changes how instructions to the EVM are structured. Specifically, it establishes a structure where one didn‚Äôt really exist before.¬†It splits bytecode into two strings of characters, one containing code and the other containing data.

This EIP also makes it easier to upgrade the EVM. It creates a system to distinguish new contracts and what features each is using.¬†The EVM executes each program based on the ‚Äúversion‚Äù of the EVM it was released in, so new upgrades can be delivered more easily.  


EIP-3670  
This introduces the concept of code validation, specifically when a smart contract is deployed.¬†Contracts today aren‚Äôt validated by the Ethereum network before they‚Äôre deployed, they get validated as they‚Äôre executed by people.

Validating contracts upon deployment saves significantly on execution costs. Programs are validated once upon deployment, and any necessary data for operation is made available in the data section of the bytecode.  


EIP-4200  
Quick tangent: Stack machines can be imagined as glass containers, tall and thin.¬†They execute instructions and store data in these glass containers. The first piece of data is placed at the bottom, and everything afterwards gets placed on top, in a ‚Äústack.‚Äù

Stack machines have pointers that can move between pieces of data to read them. The way Ethereum shift its pointer today is with a ‚ÄúJUMP‚Äù which requires a destination, or a ‚ÄúJUMPDEST.‚Äù

EIP-4200's new opcodes enables the Ethereum stack machine to shift its pointer far more efficiently. This results in cheaper gas fees both for deploying a contract as well as for interacting with one. It also makes on-chain analysis easier.  


EIP-4750  
This introduces functions that the stack itself can perform. Functions are instructions that need to be performed more than once in a program.¬†Writing such instructions once as a function makes programs more efficient, leading to cost savings on Ethereum.

Currently, functions don‚Äôt exist at the bytecode level (that the stack machine executes) on Ethereum.¬†To repeat instructions, the ‚ÄúJUMP‚Äù and ‚ÄúJUMPDEST‚Äù opcodes are instead used to shift the pointer to where an instruction is when it needs to be executed.  


EIP-5450  
This EIP focuses on validating contracts upon deployment, but by looking for errors the stack machine might encounter, called stack overflows or underflows.

Stack Overflow = when a stack is out of space  
Stack Underflow = retrieving data from an empty stack

Despite stack overflows and underflows being basic errors, they can occur on Ethereum today.¬†The checks to prevent them are introduced with this EIP. 

&amp;#x200B;

EOF is a suite of 5 EIPs, together making EVM execution more efficient, more consistent, and more easily upgradeable.  EOF itself is first upgrade in the EVM's history, and can be expected in the Shanghai Hard Fork in March, 2023.

ethereum,"Layer 2 activity is ramping up and has surpassed Layer 1 Ethereum for some metrics, including transactions per second.  


I've noticed that TPS are higher on Layer 2 networks than on Ethereum. However, this does not equate to overall activity on those respective networks. Later, I ran across the info that according to Etherscan, there were 992,470 transactions on Ethereum on Dec. 20.  


The flip actually occurred in late September but has remained above Ethereum TPS ever since. Ethereum currently processes around 12.5 TPS, and L2 networks combined are closer to 15 TPS. L2 activity and TPS spiked to a peak of 25 TPS in late October.  


Which L2 protocol do you use?  


Arbitrum One is the market leader, with a dominance of 54% and a TVL of $2.3 billion. Optimism comes second with a $1.14 billion TVL and a 27% market share, according to the platform. I used both, but currently, I'm the most satisfied with Metis.

ethereum," In theory, L2 blockchains will become more valuable than L1s. If one of the primary reasons for holding an L1 token is for its use within the ecosystem, but an existing L2 is faster and cheaper, why hold L1 other than paying for fees when using the L2?

For a concrete example, if I'm buying NFTs on Opensea and I use Polygon, I'd rather hold more Matic than ETH because all I need ETH for is fees, but Matic is what I use to interact with the Dapp and purchase goods/services.

ethereum,"Have you heard about three huge opportunities yet to be realized in crypto, including mass crypto wallet adoption, inflation-resistant stablecoins, and Ethereum-powered website logins that Buterin has shared?  


During an interview with Bankless co-owner David Hoffman, Buterin shared his outlook for the crypto industry in 2023, responding to Hoffman‚Äôs raised concern that the ‚Äúadoption wave‚Äù for decentralized applications is now over and that there‚Äôs ‚Äúless opportunity‚Äù for developers to come in and build new decentralized applications.  


Secondly, Buterin said the creation of a hyperinflation-resistant and globally accessible stablecoin that can withstand all types of conditions, both on-chain and in the broader macroeconomy, would be a revolution for the industry.  


What do you think about it?  


I strongly believe that all of this is pretty possible because people still hold ETH in extremely high regard and because Layer 2 activity, Polygon, and Metis are all experiencing excellent growth that will likely lead to future trends in the year and beyond. It's obvious that these metrics are reaching new highs into 2022, so I'm looking forward to seeing all of these huge opportunities that Buterin mentioned.

ethereum,"I am trying to understand sidechains and how they relate to ethereum but all the articles I read keep saying things like:

&gt; A sidechain is a separate blockchain that runs independent of Ethereum and is connected to Ethereum Mainnet by a two-way bridge

That is from [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/sidechains/)

But I don't get it. Solana has bridges to Ethereum, does that make Solana a side chain of Ethereum? Polkadot has bridges to Ethereum, is that also a side chain?

I mean what makes an ethereum ""sidechain"" distinct from other ""chains"" that can also have bridges to Ethereum?

Also in the article above, it is stated that:

&gt; Sidechains can have separate block parameters and consensus algorithms, which are often designed for efficient processing of transactions

Okay so sidechains have some edge over mainchain, mainly processing speed. If that is the case, why then does it need to be connected to the mainchain and acts as a sidechain to the main chain?

I ask because it is also stated that the sidechain does not derives it's security from the mainchain. So if it does not derive its security from the ethereum mainchain, why does it then even have to have a ""sidechain relationship"" with the ethereum mainchain.

ethereum,"**Context**

I am Data Scientist on a Growth Marketing team for a small startup. One of our highest converting channels is upselling existing users via email. I've heard many folks in this space (""web3"") advocating for the transition of *Email\\MFA-based* to *Wallet-based* authentication.

I get it. It simplifies the trivial frictions for end-users with *Email\\MFA-based* authentication and lets them control how they connect. However, it is a big issue for startups like us. If we switched to *Wallet-based* authentication or offered both, we would lose one of our primary communication channels, ""email."" As a result, we would then need to collect the email address also. Asking for both seems tacky, and I see many users opting out simply because we asked. In this circumstance, why would we ever switch to *Wallet-based auth?*

Aside from email marketing, I can think of several other circumstances that adversely affect the operations of Web2 companies. Consider Amazon; they wouldn't be able to notify customers about deliveries or provide specific support ""over email."" Or Facebook with unauthorized or unusual logins.

Many web3 projects rely on Discord or Reddit to build communities with users, but these don't seem ideal in this circumstance. I have also seen this subreddit spammed with folks promoting simple chat apps using IPFS or some derivative of that idea. Kinda seem like these break the ""No product promotion"" rule. But whatever, these do not work either.

ethereum,"Over the past few months, Ethereum's ""censorship"" issue has gotten worse as some validators in charge of maintaining the blockchain's ledger ignore specific transactions in order to adhere to rules. Purists of crypto's anti-censorship movement, though, may have cause for optimism.  


I've read somewhere that like 66% of blocks added to the Ethereum blockchain in the last day were OFAC-compliant, excluding transactions involving individuals or organizations blacklisted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department.  


Every week, there are various concerns regarding cryptocurrencies, the bear market, Solana's problems, the FTX scandal, and now this. I miss the days when the only issue was high gas fees, which we quickly resolved with Metis, Polygon, or any of these L2 protocols.  


What‚Äôs the problem with MEV-Boost?  


Since September when we experienced Ethereum Merge, the majority of blocks that are added to the blockchain go through MEV-Boost, a piece of middleware that enables validators, those who add and approve ""blocks"" of transactions to Ethereum's ledger, to request already-made blocks from a community of builders.  


Initially, the purpose of MEV-Boost was to aid validators in obtaining MEV, or Maximum Extractible Value, which refers to the extra revenue that blocks builders and validators can earn by carefully rearranging or inserting transactions within a block.  


As I heard others attribute the decline in censorship to the fact that validators are more willing to connect to relays that are not Flashbots, now that they have become more comfortable with the MEV-Boost space.

I wanted to share a thought I had about how putting stocks on the blockchain could help stock exchanges in less liquid markets attract investments and improve the lives of those in the region. And the best part is, it could all be done while encouraging transparency and giving liquidity providers a new way to invest in the stock market.

So what do I mean by ""less liquid markets""? These are stock exchanges in regions or countries where there isn't as much trading activity. This can make it difficult for companies to raise the capital they need to grow and succeed, and it can also make it hard for investors to find good opportunities.

But by putting stocks on the blockchain, these exchanges can potentially attract more investment from around the world. The transparency and security of the blockchain can make it easier for investors to feel confident about putting their money into these markets. And for the companies listed on these exchanges, it can provide a new source of funding and a way to tap into a global investor base.

But it's not just about attracting more investment. By bringing more activity to these exchanges, we can also help to improve the lives of those in the region. When companies are able to raise the capital they need, they can create jobs, drive economic growth, and contribute to the overall well-being of the community.

And for automatic market maker liquidity providers, this could be a fun and exciting new way to invest in the stock market. Instead of just being limited to the major exchanges, they can now potentially access a whole new world of opportunities and help to drive liquidity in these less liquid markets.",Putting stocks on the blockchain from less liquid exchanges,1.0,1,zqux41,godking99,0,2022-12-20 17:56:33,1671559007,1671559007,2022-12-20,17:56:33

ethereum,"After scouring Reddit I have decided to write one more post about Sea Tokens Opensea airdrop.

Folks this is a confiscated phishing attempt to you get you to connect your crypto wallet to their websites.

So far I have found the following fake websites claiming you will get over 500 dollars in free crypto.

They are as follows....

{seatokens. live}

{seatokens. app}

{Seatokens. co}

These are all fake websites that have been created to drain your crypto wallet from all its funds.

This is a confiscated project that involves many people doing bad things.

Don't get tricked by the upvotes or the screenshots making you think this is all for real.

I suspect that many people have already had their wallets drained by thinking this is a legit operation by judging from all the deleted comments in all these same posts I have found across Reddit.

People who have deleted their comments in these posts are the ones who probably lost money but are too embarrassed to admit it and that is why they have deleted their comments.

As soon as I get one Reddit post taken down about Sea Tokens airdrops on Opensea it seems 20 new posts are made about this fake airdrop.

All the likes that these posts get are from the bad actors who have created this scam operation.

These bad actors have probably made a killing from this scam and that is why you will find hundreds of posts on Reddit about FREE Sea tokens airdropped from opensea.

Do your own research can be hard so here I did it for you.

Do not connect your wallet for some dumb free NFT or token.

Your signing a smart contract for fake Sea tokens and are giving these bad actors a backdoor into draining all your crypto funds.

Happy Holidays!

ethereum,"L2 protocols finally seem to be gaining traction, which is good news for Ethereum.  


At this point, it would seem plausible to conclude that Ethereum has successfully used network effects and the first mover advantage in the field of smart contract technology and that it should now be trying to expand on this, a stage that Layer 2s can enable.  


Which one do you employ?  


I'm used to Metis, a scaling solution that also seeks to enhance the DAO idea by making it into something more serious through what it refers to as a DAC.  


The Ethereum network, which has the most developer activity and is the only cryptocurrency that is not obscure to those who are not active in crypto, may continue to be at the center of web3 as it develops.  


As a sign of Ethereum's trustworthy reputation, I'd say that ETH is the only cryptocurrency except for Bitcoin which can be seen as a somewhat conservative digital asset to own over the long run.  


Although Ethereum is currently dominant and should remain so, it would be wrong to claim that there is no potential for any rival Layer 1s. A direct competitor to Ethereum that offers identical functionalities without the gas cost and scaling issues is referred to as Alternative Layer 1.",L2 protocols finally seem to be gaining traction,1.0,1,zppa5m,the_phallus_of_joy,0,2022-12-19 11:39:35,1671449991,1671449992,2022-12-19,11:39:35
ethereum,"I was a bitcoin maxi. I moved a lot of $ to eth, I still purchase a little bitcoin but more future cash flow goes to bitcoin. Here's my questions:

1. Do you believe that more and more people that hold btc will start to move towards eth? It appears that this is a much slower process than I anticipated and there's still a belief by many that eth is worthless (which I can't understand, but it's similar to many gold/silver people thinking crypto is worthless).
2. I think assets have high volatilities because humans are always fearful and greedy. It will never end. I saw this with housing. When I was 23 I saw people that made 200k a year (admittedly a good chunk of money back then) owning 10 + homes all with massive leverage and nonsensical loans. When I was 25 I saw those same homes lose 50% of their value and yet there being crickets at fire sale open houses. If this is true for eth, do you believe $700 was the bottom, or that we are NOT at the final flush out?
3. One of the most common narratives is that ""the institutions are coming"". That if just 1-5% of assets go into this sector, price goes bananas. I've heard this with gold, with bitcoin, etc. I hear it for etc-that in fact institutions will buy it because proof of stake is a lot more palatable than the proof of work energy perception. Do you think this is actually reasonable or a sales pitch?
4. I understand the idea of holding for 5+ years or forever...but I also understand life happens. For those who own eth, is there a price that you would sell your eth, and if so, how much of your position and why?
5. Give me your most bullish and bearish price target and why by 2025 and/or 2030.",This post is simply about future value of eth,1.0,1,zpe92w,Tryingtodoit23,0,2022-12-19 01:31:37,1671413515,1671413516,2022-12-19,01:31:37

ethereum,"Presumably, 2022 was not a good year for Blockchain / Web 3 / DLT (you name it). I put all three wordings in the same bucket to draw the bigger picture. 

This year was full of Scams (3AC, Terra Luna, Celsius, FTX...). Unfortunately, this is what non-crypto-people think of first when I talk with them regarding blockchain-related topics (in my case, mostly technically wise, and no trading stuff as I am a developer and not a trader).

We have seen so many things that are perfect for putting water on the critics' mills. 

2022 was a year when every *""I told you so""* guy had at least one moment in their life when they were right for once. 

What do you guys think of the future of Blockchain nowadays with the current situation in mind:

* Regulators don't like it
* Governments are afraid of it
* The ""normal people"" don't like it (and yet don't understand it)
* Many of the above think only of *""Scam! Scam! Scam!""* or call it a *Ponzi scheme*
* Instead lot's of ""*You still don't have a valid use case""*\-arguments
* ""Web3 solves only those problems that it has created itself.""

While leaving the everyday people behind, technically, we are already some decades ahead in discussing whether to use *zk-SNARK* or *zk-STARK* because it is called to be quantum-resistant.

ethereum,"Hey everyone,

I   wanted to share a new service I developed to keep track of new crypto-related articles on Medium. It's called ""Medium Notification   Service"" and it helps programmers to easily integrate notifications for new articles published by their selected authors, publications, and for  articles with certain tags.

One of the best things about this service is that it can monitor thousands of   Medium accounts every 15 minutes and send notifications in JSON format by making a POST request to a given webhook URL. This makes it super  convenient for developers to integrate these notifications into their own applications or websites.

I've been using this service for myself for a couple of weeks now and it has  saved me a ton of time by not manually checking for new articles. If you're a developer and you're looking for an easy way to stay up-to-date with new articles on Medium, I highly recommend giving this service a try.

Whoever watched it and understands even the most basic concepts can accurately identify all the misinformation thrown into the Congress's and the viewer's faces. Whether it was out of malice or misunderstanding is debatable.....

These are real people testifying in front of the camera. Whether we like it or not, the things they say are what the wider population hears. To someone just watching the news, this will most certainly look like it is coming from the community. The FTX collapse does have a silver lining, though. Because of it, people are listening.

ethereum,"Guys, I usually get english but this time its all going over my head. 

I know what finality means, I know both finalisation and justification upgrades. But the following did not make sense to me. 


‚Äúfinality requires a two-thirds agreement that a block is canonical, an attacker cannot possibly create an alternative finalized chain without:

- Owning or manipulating two-thirds of the total staked ether.

- Destroying at least one-third of the total staked ether.


The first condition arises because two-thirds of the staked ether is required to finalize a chain. 

The second condition arises because if two-thirds of the total stake has voted in favor of both forks, then one-third must have voted on both. Double-voting is a slashing condition that would be maximally punished, and one-third of the total stake would be destroyed.‚Äù


What I understood: 

- 66.66% of total eth staked needs to be vote for upgradation of the concerned block. 

The above alone and not even the reasoning or how this voting happens.(like if they ask for finalising/justifying x block or is all of that done by only asking which chain is the correct latest blockchain state or what exactly is asked)

I really believe someone prominent in the community like Vitalik should explain the real state of the networks and the concepts of decentralisation. I believe understanding crypto right now for the average Joe is like reading the terms of service of Instagram or some other data mining app. The latter has already hurt people's trust a lot. 

We need to stand up against the misinformation and AT LEAST create some easy to follow videos and/or articles that explain decentralisation and what is really going on like an ELI5 version of Lex and Vitalik's conversation. The way to fight misinformation is to put information in words understandable by all. 

This information needs to come from the community otherwise we get the voices that are assigned to us like Kevin O'Leary. No offense to Kevin O'Leary. He is an accomplished human.

The halting problem on a Turing machine is supposed to be undecidable.

However, a smart contract will always halt. It either completes or runs out of gas.

So, the evm is a Turing machine, runs a Turing complete language, but the halting problem is decidable.

So, is the evm a Turing machine? No? What‚Äôs the standard way to describe this sort of Turing machine that can halt?",Question on halting,1.0,1,zmzlah,coranos2,0,2022-12-15 23:18:41,1671146332,1671146332,2022-12-15,23:18:41

* [Full post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/12/15/kzg-ceremony-grants-round)
* Form - [Apply before Jan 31st](https://kzgceremony.paperform.co/)

The Ethereum community is running a Powers of Tau ceremony to enable EIP-4844 üïØ  As a refresher, check out [this summary thread](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1573342059129229312) about this crucial prerequisite on the path towards our network scaling.

The Ceremony will remain credible &amp; secure long-term if we can provide many sources of hard-to-bias entropy.  Towards this goal, a Grants Round! We're looking to support two types of projects with funding:  

* additional implementations üë©‚Äçüíª
   * these will reduce the risk of a bug in any single one, gives participants more options, supports the comm. engaging with its infra
   * if you've been looking for an excuse to get more familiar w/ KZG or Powers of Tau setups, this is a golden opportunity! 
* unique entropy sources üé≤
   *  Although the Ceremony only needs a single honest participant to be secure, we want to take it a step further and make the social assurances around it as airtight as possible.. 
   * ..which means getting entropy (randomness) from sources that are \_really\_ hard to bias / mess with eg. in the [@zcash](https://twitter.com/zcash) Sapling setup, Andrew Miller and Ryan Pierce famously measured radioactivity from a Chernobyl artifact while flying at 3000 ft ‚úà ([link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4cDAqeEmpU&amp;t=20s))
   *  While we're not expecting every idea to be this involved, we do encourage people to think outside the box and be creative!
   * Where can you get randomness that's especially unique to your city/ community? What can you think of to engage your local Ethereum comm. to help?
   * How will you document the project to prove to other Ceremony participants that your methodology was sound?  We're excited to see the proposals you all dream up - remember to read the post for more details and the application link!  

This Ceremony is a unique opportunity for anyone to play an important role in building Ethereum protocol infra!

ethereum,"The number of players in blockchain games today is still not very high because people are still more interested in traditional gaming and have expectations of GameFi that they want to be fulfilled before they start playing these games.    
 

Currently, there are a lot of blockchain games that are competing with one another to attract as many players as possible.   
Which game do you consider most interesting or that has everything you expect a quality game to have?   
 

I guess that a mature GameFi project needs to have good features that would ensure that the project is a success.    
 

There are a lot of GameFi projects out there but the one that caught my attention is Wam with the native token WAM. Before I discovered that game, I played regular ones, accepted by many other gamers - Alien Worlds, CryptoKitties, etc.

By the way, I think blockchain was the most important in this regard because it made the transition from ""play to play"" games to ""play to earn"" games easy.

What a clickbait title I know but I‚Äôm actually curious to read answers. It‚Äôs always refreshing to collect different views and opinions.

Obviously the largest factor is the speculative investment &amp; current / future demand for it. To use it as payment but also to play around with it. The proof of stake system will overtime also increase its value and future development such as lowering gas fees give lots of speculation value.

Stake rewards are also attractive for those that believe in the project long run and want to accumulate passively more of their asset.

ethereum,"Blockchains serve as excellent records of transactions. Blockchains are records, but what makes changes to those records is known as a ‚Äústate machine.‚Äù A state machine updates the state of the blockchain from a previous to a new state.

Bitcoin was the first widely-used blockchain. Its state machine is responsible for very basic features, essentially executing transactions between people. It's very hard to do anything with Bitcoin other than send or receive funds; that's all the state machine can do.

Ethereum was created to improve upon this model. The key changes Ethereum made were that the blockchain could store code &amp; the state machine could execute it. Ethereum‚Äôs state machine is what we know as the EVM &amp; can execute both transactions and custom code.

 The Ethereum Virtual Machine is capable of executing any program or algorithm, given enough resources. In computer science terms this means it is a Turing-complete machine. Any program can be built on this new operating system, available to all, censorable by none.

To better understand the EVM, we should quickly review what a transaction is on Ethereum. A transaction is a message with either funds, data, or both, between people and programs. People are known as Externally Owned Accounts &amp; programs are called smart contracts.

Transactions with smart contracts can include funds or data, or both. When funds are sent to a smart contract, the smart contract can hold them or perform actions with them. The types of actions performed by the smart contract depend on the data in the transaction.

To be more specific, when a transaction is sent the EVM looks at what it contains, then executes the smart contract‚Äôs code based on the data &amp; funds inside. The result is recorded on the blockchain. The blockchain is the record &amp; the EVM is what causes changes to it.

&amp;#x200B;

ethereum,"Why is a sizable number of people ignoring Ethereum DEXes in favor of CEXes?  
Rumors about Binance being insolvent are floating around CT. And regardless of the fact that these rumors are probably just that, rumors, Binance (or any other centralized exchange) should have never had this much power over the market.

Binance is technically controlled by a single man (CZ) meaning that one person has the power to make or break the crypto market.

This is far from what Vitalik and Satoshi planned for.

Satoshi wanted to get rid of government control over monetary supply, and Vitalik wanted to create an ecosystem that will end up helping us self govern through DeFi and DAOs.

We already have DEXs Uniswap, Pancakeswap, and there are Ethereum based organizations like Bitdao investing hundreds of millions of dollars into new DEXs like ApeX so there‚Äôs really no shortage of any sort of decentralized exchanges out there on the market.

The fact that we‚Äôre being lazy and purposely relying on centralized exchanges is the problem. This is exactly why exchanges like Binance pose a huge threat for the market because in a scenario where it fails (though unlikely) the entire market could go down with it

- If a decentralised project is not running their node by themselves then isn‚Äôt it nonsense? 




- Client diversity is emphasised much but still Geth and Prysm &amp; Nethermind are majorly used clients making this again not secure with single point of failure which all of this was created for?

- Not a question but please correct me if I am wrong, Execution Layer is the one where new txns are shared, executed on blockchain and state is updated. 

Consensus Layer is the one where consensus happens with now p-o-s which checks if data is valid to make immutable changes or not.

ethereum,"I discovered that addresses can be obfuscated so that the address is not in the contract's memory, but instead the contract stores a hashed version of the address. Then it can be checked later by performing the same hash. If someone checks every ethereum address then they could figure out which one it is. It would only take a few seconds to compute. However, I think if it's an unknown address that hasn't made any transactions then it would be private because it uses a secure hash function. But it would only be private until that account makes its first transaction.

Here is an example with code:

\`\`\`

bytes32 public accountHash;  
bytes32 public salt;

&amp;#x200B;

constructor(bytes32 \_accountHash, bytes32 \_salt) {

accountHash = \_accountHash;  
¬† ¬† salt = \_salt;  
 }

¬†   bytes memory toHash = bytes.concat(abi.encodePacked(a), salt);  
bytes32 hash = sha256(toHash);  
return hash == accountHash;  
}

ethereum,"I was reading Andreas Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood book, Mastering Ethereum (link to [open source version on Githib)](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook). 

According to the authors in [chapter 4](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/04keys-addresses.asciidoc), Ethereum was built on the Keccak-256 encryption function which was created by NIST. Shortly after this function was released and adopted, a supposedly new and improved version of it was released by NIST. This new ""SHA 3"" function was going to be used by Ethereum and is actually listed in many of the docs as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

Edward Snowden's leaked documents showed that the NSA had potentially placed a backdoor into this newer function, allowing them to break its encryption if they ever needed to. This leak caused the Ethereum community to stick with Keccak, single-handedly saving it from the NSA.

Do you agree with that?  


I believe that many NFT projects are copy-paste, there are many projects that lack quality, that appear to have been created overnight only to try to make a profit, and that there is a lot of junk on the NFT scene and like no one has actually thought about the needs of users or whether all these projects are even necessary.  


WAM is currently my favorite NFT project, and in general, the only NFT projects I can claim are excellent are games. I don't have any regular NFT collections that I can single out as my favorites.  


Vaynerchuck emphasized that there has been a lot of FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) coming from the media and social media users this year, who have regularly brought up issues like decreased trading volumes and floor pricing, in his appraisal of the market's predicament.

Today, the average gas cost required to send ether is estimated to be around $2.87 which is 95.43% cheaper than it was over a year ago in November 2021.  


According to statistics, fees associated with the Ethereum network have been less than $5 per transaction over the last 175 days.   


According to metrics, the average Ethereum transfer on December 10, 2022, is around 0.0023 ether or $2.87, while the median-sized gas fee is around 0.00097 ether or $1.23 per transfer. According to Ethereum gas metrics collected by etherscan.io, high transfer fees are even lower than the median and average-sized gas payments.  


Metis fees for sending ether are approximately $0.04 per transfer, and Optimism L2 fees are approximately $0.10 per transaction. Similarly, the value of Zksync, Loopring, Polygon Hermez, Boba, and Aztec L2 transactions is significantly lower than that of traditional on-chain Ethereum network transfers.

Examples of factors would be:

\-Github stars/presences

\-Transaction history

\-History of people having problems

\-Website itself

ethereum," We are excited to announce that we have launched [SafeEscrow](https://www.watermelonmarkets.com/safeescrow-specs/), a mutually-assured-destruction type of escrow contract for use in decentralized marketplaces, on the Ethereum network. Our first application of SafeEscrow is on [WaterMelonMarkets](https://www.watermelonmarkets.com/), a defi marketplace for real-world goods, including gift cards.

Our solution offers a high-trust way for users to buy and sell goods on the blockchain. SafeEscrow allows buyers to keep their funds locked up until they receive their purchased item and verify that it works, providing protection against fraud and scams.  We're not the first to use something like this, as OpenBazaar and past marketplaces have also.  But our strategy is to not push technology for the sake of tech, but sell products and see what actually works for our users.  (OpenBazaar was infamously Bitcoin maxi at the start which stifled innovation).

You can read more about [SafeEscrow](https://www.watermelonmarkets.com/safeescrow-specs/) and verify the smart contract on our website. As part of our launch promotion, we are [offering a discount of 45%](https://www.watermelonmarkets.com/product/amazon-gift-card-100-electronic-delivery/) on all gift cards while supplies last.  We offer both USDC on Ethereum mainnet and on Polygon (for lower gas fees).  We thought gift cards are a great first application since the crypto-gift card marketplace is rife with fraud and used gift cards, and SafeEscrow solves all of that.

We are a funded startup and are committed to building useful and reliable applications on the Ethereum network. We would love to hear your feedback on SafeEscrow and WaterMelonMarkets, or even better for you to try a product ([even a small one](https://www.watermelonmarkets.com/product/amazon-egift-card-10-electronic-delivery/)) and tell us your experience.",Introducing SafeEscrow: A M.A.D.

### About Aragon

Aragon is a suite of applications and services that enable new forms of global communities.

Communities can organize around capital assets, currency, or tokens, which will increase in value as more people hold and use that asset to participate in the community. By providing the tools for people to turn a community, cause, or even a meme into its own economy, we can unlock a long tail of DAOs that are not limited just to protocols like Ethereum or Bitcoin.

Aragon not only provides basic financial tools like tokenization but can create reproducible and broadly applicable templates for defining the boundaries of a community and flowing value to contributors over the internet without traditional intermediaries.

The Aragon project was founded to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of organizations. We believe everyone should have equal access to governance and collaboration, no matter their age, gender, or race. The project was originally started by Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo in November 2016.

ethereum,"This is what someone said when I said smart contracts were useful. Can anyone debunk it: 

 

*No, they are not useful and some of them are so insane that I can't believe anybody who spent more than 60 seconds thinking about them would ever think they're useful. It even touches on the fatal flaw of smart contacts while falsely claiming they're the solution:*

&gt;*If there‚Äôs a dispute between the two parties, a governmental third party must get involved. In many cases, this third party will also play a role in the creation of the contract.*

*OK, so what if there actually is a dispute? The contract says X is supposed to happen but enforcement is automatic based on certain conditions. But what about conditions that aren't able to be included in the contract? Sure rent is due on the first but the water was off for a week and the tenant doesn't owe the full amount. All contracts for stuff in the real world still have to abide by the legal system, which means ultimately courts need to be able to control what happens, even if someone absolutely refuses to play along.*

*Imagine you're trying to sell a house using smart contracts. Do you even own the house in the first place? Just because you have some token saying you do doesn't mean you actually do. If someone steals your private key, do they now own your house? If the token is not the actual definitive record of ownership (and it absolutely should not be), then you haven't removed reliance on third parties but just added an irrelevant, not legally-binding aspect to the system.*

*And of course all of this is assuming that we can make smart contracts perfect, without any errors. Code can and will have errors, and many people have already lost fortunes due to poorly-written contracts. If there's no enforcement system external to the contract, it's not usable in the real world. If there is an external system then the smart contract is no longer the definitive truth and serves no useful purpose.*",Smart Contract Utility Explanation,1.0,1,zh2bj1,mybed54,0,2022-12-09 16:55:59,1670604974,1670604974,2022-12-09,16:55:59

Having a problem with a Next.js app.

Anyone familiar with wagmi library for React know why my dapp is defaulting to the `defaultProvider()`? Even after removing the default from the chain configuration completely.

Browser debug doesn't seem to be properly reading my API keys from my environment variables. I've never had this problem when initializing from create-react-app, so I'm wondering if since I started from an `npx create-next-app` if I'm missing something. Environment variables are in `.env.local` in the main directory.

Here's my `_app.tsx`

    import '../styles/globals.css';
    import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';
    import '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/styles.css';
    import { getDefaultWallets, RainbowKitProvider } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
    import { chain, configureChains, createClient, WagmiConfig } from 'wagmi';
    import { alchemyProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/alchemy';
    import { infuraProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/infura';
    
    const { chains, provider } = configureChains(
      [chain.mainnet],
      [
        alchemyProvider({
          apiKey: process.env.ALCHEMY_API!,
        }),
        infuraProvider({
          apiKey: process.env.INFURA_API!,
        }),
      ]
    );
    
    const { connectors } = getDefaultWallets({
      appName: 'Testing Mint DApp',
      chains,
    });
    
    const wagmiClient = createClient({
      autoConnect: true,
      connectors,
      provider,
    });
    
    function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
      return (
        &lt;WagmiConfig client={wagmiClient}&gt;

ethereum,"MySpace was one of the first massively successful social media websites. Many would consider it to be ahead of it's time, as it reached widespread popularity before sites like Twitter and Facebook were invented. Moreover, MySpace found success well before social media became a cornerstone of the internet and web 3.0. While MySpace was successful, ultimately it was the social media companies that emulated MySpace's model that became the most influential, profitable, and dominant. 

If the future of the internet is going to be defined by blockchain technology and decentralised apps,  perhaps Ethereum won't be the champion of this architecture.  It was and still is ahead of it's time, much like MySpace was. If the same pattern follows, another project might come along, emulate Ethereum's success, and surpass Ethereum. Maybe Ethereum is just too early and by the time there is demand for this technology, something newer and shiner will have popped onto the scene to take it's place.

ethereum,"The rise of blockchain-based games such as Alien Worlds, Splinterlands, and Axie Infinity shows no signs of abating. However, when it comes to supporting play-and-earn crypto mechanics and NFTs, the larger video gaming industry is divided.  


It's interesting to note that almost all major game publishers now have blockchain development teams, but they're having difficulty reconciling their traditional business approach with blockchain and its role in the future of games.  


Microsoft even provided blockchain-as-a-service within Azure for nearly a decade before handing over their existing customers to ConsenSys Quorum last year.  


There are many great blockchain games with excellent gameplay, including Alien Worlds, Splinterlands, Axie, WAM, Gods Unchained, and others.  


Others, however, are taking the opposite approach. Last year, the video game distributor Steam banned all games that allowed NFT and crypto trades.  


I believe that was a mistake, because as time passes, more and more blockchain gamers emerge, and people begin to accept these games.  


Minecraft developer Mojang banned NFT support inside Minecraft client and server applications earlier this year in a similar move.

Say I have a system that collects 100 transactions before rolling them up and posting to L1, do I have to wait for all 100 transactions to be posted on my (L2) system before I post them?

What if it's a slow day and I only have 50 transactions waiting to be rolled up?

Is there a timeout where those 50 would be sent after a set time?

Do rollups get sent periodically (eg. every 10 minutes) regardless?

ethereum,"A shift toward a more modular design is currently playing out in the blockchain landscape.  More and more, we‚Äôre seeing data, computation, settlement, and consensus becoming untangled and tackled more explicitly, often by different players (and layers).

We briefly explore the benefits and tradeoffs of four different consensus ‚Äúuniverses‚Äù:

* *Global Consensus*: all applications run together in the L1 same universe
* *Sharded Consensus*: some applications run together in a parallel universe to escape overcrowding in the L1 universe

ethereum,"I'm an idiot, no doubts about that.  For more than a decade in crypto, I managed to survive without losing a dime to multiple hacks/scams/losses/thefts. 

On Friday they caught me off guard. 
Here is how it happened, so you can avoid it if the same happens to you: 

* I was traveling together with a family, away from my laptop and with my mind focused on other things and priorities. 

* A trusted friend who knows me well, sends me a telegram message with the following text: ""Hey, isn't this the airdrop you told me you were looking forward to? -&gt; link to a tweet"". 
* He was talking about zkSync, which I was looking forward to. I was aware that no airdrop had been announced and that multiple scam attempts were around. 

* A few weeks earlier, I used my main ETH hot wallet to perform a whole bunch of actions to interact with zkSync (1 and 2), just to play around with it. 

* So as I was in the car, and since I was anxious to know if that was the real airdrop, I opened the tweet (which btw is still online as of now, 5 days later ---&gt; https://imgur.com/a/ITBH31u 

* I read the tweet, and on a quick first look it seemed very legit: it came from what seemed to be a dev: blue checkmark (FU Elon),  Twitter account account joined in 2012, 300k followers, 900 retweets.

* FOMO kicked in. Fuck me.  This must be IT, everything checks. A trusted friend sent it to me, and the Twitter account is real.  
* I already performed most of the actions required to participate ""the airdrop"" (interact with zkSync in different ways). All I have to do is just go to the website, connect with Metamask and join the whitelist. 
* I wanted to get it done as fast as I possibly could, so I could forget about it and go on with my family trip. No need to check further. (took me off guard, told you). 
* So I went on the website (if I only paid more attention to the URL... ), and connected my Metamask mobile wallet to it. He asked me to sign something to join the white list. Then nothing happened. 
OK, I made it!
* My wallet was fully ""loaded"" as I was gathering liquidity to start a minipool on the next week :(. 
* 1 hour later I receive an alert from a watched wallet on etherscan. And I could see my whole ETH balance leaving my wallet using the function ""SecurityUpdate"" going out to https://etherscan.io/address/0xd13b093eafa3878de27183388fea7d0d2b0abf9e . 

* I knew what happened immediately. Reported the tweet, reported the address on etherscan, and watch my ultrasound money flying, along with thousands of other incoming transactions from other people. 
* This person/group is making millions as I type, and it seems unstoppable. To see his funds moving OUT, he is using some sort of internal transactions -&gt; https://etherscan.io/address/0xd13b093eafa3878de27183388fea7d0d2b0abf9e#internaltx

So, I have ONE important question now: should I burn my ethereum address now and never use it again? If I move ether on it, will he/she be able to steel it from me again, of was just a one-off bundle tx he signed?  He didn't take my NFTs, nor my ENS. He didn't take my ERC20 tokens (not much) .

ethereum,"L2s have made major gains in the recent year and have developed new tech and upped their throughput.  
Ethereum as well has pushing into upgrading the chain in a way that boosts L2 throughput (dank-sharding towards the end of 2023)

However, regardless of how fast a chain/L2 can process transactions, there will always be the issue of ***dependencies***

&amp;#x200B;

# - What are dependencies?

Dependencies are the result of blockchains (and in extension L2s) processing transactions in a sequential manner.  
Dependency is when every transaction relies on the one before it in order for it to get executed. 

This means that while a blockchain/L2 might have great processing power, all of that power is being focused on one transaction at a time regardless of how significant said transaction really is.  
This put a massive restraint on the capabilities that a blockchain/L2 is capable of performing.

Think of it as you buying a new packaging machine for your factory. This packaging machine has 10 slots to handle multiple packages at the same time, however, your factory only has one conveyor belt meaning.

So you can ‚Äútechnically‚Äù work 10 packages at a time, but ‚Äúpractically‚Äù you‚Äôre restrained by the sequential order you‚Äôre forced to follow.

&amp;#x200B;

# - How are L2s trying to solve this issue?

One way of solving this issue is implementing a ***parallel EVM engine***

Aptos Labs developed a Block-STM engine, and to make it short and uncomplicated for the average reader, what this does is it executes a bunch of transactions in parallel.  
It does that under the assumption that none of the transactions conflict.

One L2, Polygon, adopted a similar approach to their EVM in order to scale Ethereum but it came with its own set of complications.

Because Polygon processes a massive volume of transactions, the system that Aptos came up with won't work because in a hugely adopted system like the Polygon PoS, acting as if there were no dependencies anywhere, in any block, won‚Äôt work. It would be taking a theoretical idea too far

What Polygon did instead was write transactions in a data structure called ‚ÄúDAG‚Äù  
If you want you can expand your knowledge on this but in order to save time and not make things complicated, what this does is take dependencies into consideration and then execute transactions before validating, so that the metadata with deduced dependencies can be easily executed.

&amp;#x200B;

# -What does this mean for Ethereum?

While there still aren‚Äôt any parallel EVM chains right now, as we saw, certain L2s like Polygon are working on developing one and hopefully, this pushes other L2s to follow suit

This is definitely an added value for Ethereum.

In Ethereum‚Äôs new roadmap, the chain will rely solely on L2s for scalability, so this will be major news considering that a development like this one will most likely double the throughput that any L2 is currently putting out, all of which will benefit Ethereum since its main issue has always been scalability restraints.",Here‚Äôs how L2s are planning on moving from fast to even faster.,1.0,1,zejwnz,pihip2,0,2022-12-06 22:18:08,1670365103,1670365104,2022-12-06,22:18:08

ethereum,"Been researching (and adding up my stake in) XMR and BCH, but ETH is catching my eye a bit more. However, the previous two coins are proof of work, which I think I understand the pros and cons of well enough. Proof of Stake on the other hand, has me getting pretty mixed feedback and I'm not sure  what to think, as there appears to still be much uncertainty about the pros/cons of PoS vs PoW. From what I gather, some thoughts are

**Pros**:

\-More energy efficient (not inherently a bad thing to use a lot of energy, but a lot of energy was mined in China which uses less clean sources such as coal or natgas)

\-Faster (Lower time complexity and all that)

\-More scalable (as less computation power is required, that means it can run much more smoothly as ETH is something of an investment rather than something backed by computation)

**Cons**:

\-More beneficial to centralization and the rich by the model (though I will note this arguably applies to PoW, as any oligarch who wanted to take over could pay someone with technical expertise to set up their own rigs and pay them a commission, or something like that) allowing potentially for censorship and coopting whether by force or by a 51% attack.

\-Less secure (validators could be bribed?)

\-More threatened by censorship than PoW coins (I for one think government has no role to play in the creation or regulation of money and that no man should have control over it. In other words, I support the separation of state and money for the good of the masses)

**Mixed/Neutral**:

\-Still has high gas fees(?)

\-Use case is DeFi rather than outright cash (though in theory, perhaps it could be used for that as well? BCH is trying to get into DeFi as well from my understanding, so perhaps ETH could do something in the other direction)

ethereum,"Hey everyone. I had an idea for a p2p exchange like Bisq (for UK and EU) but uses Open Banking (OB) to get around many of the shortcomings that Bisq has. I want to get feedback on this.¬†

Preamble: Recently you may (or may not) know that Stripe released its own ramp in the US as has moonpay etc. I‚Äôve used the Moonpay one a few times to buy small amounts of eth for quick tests when I don‚Äôt want to use my main wallet. On a $10 transaction I was charged $4 and Stripe also takes a ridiculous cut. Obviously its possible to go through CEXs. But its not easy to integrate a low fee ramp onto a defi website and from a CEX and people dislike CEX‚Äôs for a variety of good reasons. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating seeing large fees or complex processes to get tokens into my wallet from fiat.¬†

Bisq has two major flaws in my opinion (besides the fact its in the US - Im from the UK, which I would say is more forward facing on the fintech side).¬†

1. There is little control over order sizes.¬†
2. Its not super liquid
3. The payment methods are dodgy on the fiat side¬†
4. Most importantly require proof of transaction which is difficult

I propose an exchange that combines Bisq‚Äôs framework with Open banking and some inspiration from Uniswap that should allow (virtually) free P2P, trustless\*, flexible ramping.¬†

1. A seller puts their ERC20 token in a liquidity pool (smart contract) and signs a hash with the block number, which is communicated to the buyer.¬†
2. A buyer enters the amount they wish to buy and the price is determined by an AMM/or gets the spot prices from Uniswap/Binance
3. An algorithm figures out everyone they need to pay and generates a QR to pay everyone (You can bank transfer multiple people at the same time in the UK, for free and instantly, using OB, called PISP)¬†
4. The hash is in the reference hashed with the buyer address¬†
5. An algorithm scans the sellers data to look for the hash and once it is there uses the hash to unlock the contract using some ZK proof (and can generate the address from the signed hash of the seller)/or scans the buyers bank data to ensure the transaction has been made
6. Once the contract receives this proof it sends the buyer address the stored token.¬†

This is the simple version. I‚Äôve thought alot about the associated problems including being unable to verify account data etc (to what extent does this rely on a centralized entity etc). 

The conclusion I‚Äôve reached is that this should feels completely seamless for the buyer (thanks to Open Banking), i.e. scanning 1 QR code - I believe in interoperability not competition between good CeFi innovations and DeFi. It is completely non custodial at all stages.¬†

There is actually no cost in this entire process except that of transferring the tokens to sell to a contract.¬†

I think the concept of Liquidity Providers earning some fee like 0.05% as on Uniswap can fix potential liquidity problems.¬†

ethereum,"The NFT market is down more than 90% from its peak.

That means that many investors are holding on to worthless JPEGs that they no longer want.

If you find yourself in this shitty situation, there‚Äôs a silver lining ‚ÄîBy selling your NFT at a loss before the end of the year, you can potentially save thousands of dollars on your taxes!

**What‚Äôs the point of selling my NFT at a loss?**

Whenever you dispose of capital assets like NFTs at a loss, you can claim a capital loss on your tax return. Capital losses can be used to offset capital gains and up to $3,000 of income for the year. 

**Why do I have to sell my NFTs before the end of the year?**

If you want to offset your capital gains for the 2022 tax year, you need to realize losses before the end of the year. This is probably a good move if you took gains in January 2022 back when the market was hot.

**What if nobody wants to buy my worthless NFT?**

If you can‚Äôt find a buyer for your NFT, don‚Äôt worry: there are tools that can help! For example, the[ Tax Loss Harvestooor](https://nftlossharvestooor.com/) is an open protocol that buys your worthless NFTs for a minimal amount of ETH so that you can claim a capital loss. (There are probably other tools like this too, but this is the only one I‚Äôve tried for myself).

**Is there a limit to how much losses I can claim?**

There‚Äôs no limit to how much NFT losses you can claim.

If you still have a net loss after you offset all of your capital gains and $3,000 of income, you can carry your loss forward into future tax years.

**TL;DR**: If you don‚Äôt want them anymore, sell off your worthless NFTs and write off your capital gains! ",PSA: Selling your worthless NFTs can help you save money on your taxes!,1.0,1,zdfhl6,ActualFirefighter211,0,2022-12-05 18:43:14,1670265814,1670265815,2022-12-05,18:43:14
ethereum,"Polygon needs no introduction at this point.

It's one of the most high-profile layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum.

It has attracted more than 300 games, making it one of the chains with the highest gaming transaction volume.

Also, it has secured high-profile partnerships with:

‚Ä¢ Meta and Instagram.

‚Ä¢ Starbucks.

‚Ä¢ Reddit. 

One year ago, Polygon hired the former head of gaming at YouTube, Ryan Wyatt, as the CEO of Polygon Studios.

In a recent tweet, he shared what he learned during his first year building in Web3.

Here are the key insights:

1/ The Web3 revolution should be community-led

Idolizing and putting our trust in figures like SBF doesn't work.

We should focus on decentralization, giving power back to the people who can build a brighter and more decentralized future for all of us.

2/ Be adaptive

Polygon Studios has a 5-day strategy and a 5-year strategy because the Web3 space is so volatile that you've to be quick to adapt.

3/ Worrying isn't helpful

Web3 has a lot of ups and downs, so it could make your mind constantly worry.

Don't let it go crazy.

Find your role, play to your strengths and build.

4/ There's no blueprint

The Web3 space is still young, so there's no blueprint one company could follow and succeed.

5/ Web3 is real

Despite what the media and the naysayers have to say, the interest in Web3 ain't slowing down.

Companies like Reddit, Starbucks, Instagram, Adidas, and Nike have all entered the Web3 space and will continue to build in it.

This video is about the [EMP.Money](https://emp.money/) Ecosystem and how you can take advantage of it to earn insane interest on Ethereum. [EMP.Money](https://emp.money/) is a crypto tomb fork with its own token pegged to the price of Ethereum as well as another token acting as its reward token. This allows you to yield farm with Ethereum with no impermanent loss in their farms for around 60 percent a year. However, there are other ways to earn in the ecosystem most notable with their absolutely huge Detonator. The Detonator is a system that gives you a much higher return than farms on your yield tokens but you have to burn your initial deposit. On top of that, one lucky depositor as well as the biggest depositor can earn absolutely insane lottery prizes of up to 50k.

ethereum,"This might sound like a stretch but honestly I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. CeFi is proving itself to be a failed experiment. A virus that invaded a market built around the concept of self custody, decentralization, and self governance.

No one knows what will happen in 10 years time but I don‚Äôt see why people will start shifting from CeFi to DeFi completely.

The whole reason people used CeFi in the first place was convenience and low fees as opposed the ultra high Ethereum gas fees.

However, these two issues are almost fully resolved making a shift mass shift towards DeFi a much more logical decision than staying on these lying, corrupt centralized platforms.

Many DeFi platforms are becoming much more intuitive and easier to operate so that gets rid of the first issue.

The second issue, gas, is almost completely irrelevant now with L2s becoming more and more popular.

Not only are the older L2s getting better, but even Ethereum based organizations like BitDAO are supporting layer 2 tech. They invested hundreds of millions into launching Mantle in order to scale the Ethereum DeFi and Web3 space.

Taking all of this into consideration, there‚Äôs really no excuse to choosing CeFi over DeFi especially after the various scandals that happened in the CeFi world.

ethereum,"I decided to write this after reading a previous post discussing the viability of Web3 games, which stated that the problem was most weren't all that fun to play. 

Part of the problem, based on my personal experience, is an uneven battlefield. In most P2E games, whales can often buy expensive assets that confer them a greater advantage in the game, with all things like skillset and gameplay understanding being equal. 

During its peak, anyone that could afford a $500 popular Axie would do significantly better than someone else with a $50 Axie. 

But what if a game had all players starting on a level playing field, with the NFTs only conferring them not a gameplay advantage - but an earning edge? 

Immortal Games is a **play-to-earn chess game** that utilizes NFT chess pieces with quests attached to them, that players can accomplish to improve their earnings. The rules of the game are the same - the pieces moved as they always have for hundreds of years - the only difference is that the players have back-end quests only they can see to accomplish, adding dynamism to the game. 

Good players can earn from a shared pool of $ETH, and $CMT rewards just by playing the oldest board game in the world. Those that want can buy Immortal's NFT chess pieces - Ageless and Immortal pieces - to multiply their earning potential.

ethereum,"Imagine a powerful authoritarian government (CCP, potentially, or maybe even the USA) felt threatened by Ethereum and wanted to attack the network in such a way that they were willing to pour billions or even trillions of dollars into the attack.

We know that buying a huge portion of ETH would drive the price up, but let's say cost is not something they care about. They then spin up a huge number of validators and nodes. They find a way to attack the network in such a way that many feel there is a real threat. Of course, the chain would fork and those validators would be slashed or black listed, perhaps 100% of their ETH is lost.

But at the same time this causes a crisis of faith (even if only short lived), causing the price to fall. Imagine they are (with some bank or something) also shorting ETH with significant leverage. They earn more ETH than they lose. Then they use this ETH to repeat the attack, ad infinitum.

ethereum,"Explaining this subject without getting too deep into coding languages and technicalities is extremely hard to tackle but I‚Äôll try my best.

Of course, this isn't some sort of guide on how L2s are built or operate but is merely a fun, quick explanation of how some of them are different.

I‚Äôll be focusing on zkEVM compatibility and will be comparing the top Ethereum L2s on the market with Zero Knowledge tech

As we can see, although they all do a great job at scaling Ethereum, some have a slighter advantage (Polygon zkEVM)

Polygon is currently a Type 2 in EVM equivalence meaning they built an infrastructure that is compatible with EVM at Bytecode-Level. This means Polygon‚Äôs zkEVM can achieve compatibility at both the solidity language level and opcode level.

Scroll also has similar features but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs 100% Bytecode equivalent (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong)

While competitors are at Type 4 in EVM equivalence meaning they

What it basically means is that they take a high-level coding language (like Vyper or Solidity) and transpile it down to SNARK-friendly VM. language-level (e.g. zkSync's Zinc, and StarkWare's Cairo)

ethereum,"Callisto Network is launching an ""early adopters SBT campaign"". You can now request your SBT by commenting on the following twitter thread: [https://twitter.com/CallistoSupport/status/1598317345738481667](https://twitter.com/CallistoSupport/status/1598317345738481667)

# What are SBTs?

SoulBound Tokens are non-transferable NFTs that you can own, but cannot give to anyone else. The point is that we have a type of ""valuables"" in the world that can only be represented by a SBT. A good example is a driver license - you can get it, you can own it, you can show it as a proof but you can't give it to someone else.

You can read more about SBT role in the crypto industry [here](https://dexaran820.medium.com/soulbound-tokens-a-new-word-in-on-chain-interactions-dba76a3ec635).

# What are CallistoSBTs?

CallistoSBT is a token standard for SoulBound Tokens. ERC721 features are too limited and it doesn't fit the role we want SBTs to fill so we decided to build our own token standard from scratch and not to reuse the NFT codes.

The source code can be found here: [https://github.com/Dexaran/CallistoSBT](https://github.com/Dexaran/CallistoSBT)

Key features that CallistoSBT standard provides:

1. **Data structures.** You can write data onto SBTs.
2. **Permission management.** You can manage who can write what onto your SBTs.
3. **User-defined content**. The owner of a SBT can write his data to his own SBT.

For example, SBT can represent a security audit report recorded on-chain: (1) security auditor can attach the report link to the token, (2) owner of the SBT can comment but cannot change the link that auditor assigned. SBT may prove that the DAPP address (of a contract) that it is assigned to is audited.

# What is the purpose of this ""personalized"" SBT set?

CallistoSBT is still in development. We want to offer users the opportunity to express their needs and expectations so that we could optimize the code.

This is like ""beta testing"" of the new token.

# What is the purpose of participating?

You can help the industry growth by providing your input/feedbacks. You will have an opportunity to get your first SBT for free.

It is possible to tune the explorers, wallets, on-chain services so that these could display SBTs - the sooner we will have a working prototype in use the better.

We believe that SBTs may become a new buzzword in the crypto industry just like it was with ICOs, DeFi, NFTs in the previous cycles.

# What are the future use cases for SBTs?

1. A link between Identity and on-chain address.
2. Insurance on-chain contracts.
3. Security audit reports for DAPPs on-chain.
4. Digital documents that can be issued, updated or revoked by the issuer.
5. Digital documents that require a third party to sign/verify it as notary companies.","We are launching a ""personalized"" SouldBound Tokens set. Available for acquisition by request.",1.0,1,z9rdw6,Dexaran,0,2022-12-01 15:55:37,1669910151,1669991189,2022-12-01,15:55:37

[**Dispelling FUD over WETH joke** ](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1597065213156941825)

* Apologizes for participating in the WETH jokes as he underestimate the fact people would take this seriously.
* Wrapped Ethereum is a smart contract that lives on the Ethereum network that only has 62 lines of code, an extremely simple smart contract code that allows one to convert ETH to a WETH token and vice versa.
* It is not possible for the WETH to lend out the funds or to be insolvent as it‚Äôs not programmed for it.
* If WETH was to be exploited,      it already would have been exploited as it‚Äôs been up for years.
* WBTC on Ethereum is custodied by BitGo and problems with BitGo side BTC could cause issues with the peg of WBTC.

* Binance announces Proof of      Reserves and Jesse Powell reacted that this is either ignorance or intentional misrepresentation as the merkle tree without an auditor is BS and that the statement of assets is pointless without liabilities.
* Proof of Reserve should be      Proof of Asset - Proof of Liability.
* DeFi can truly prove Proof of Reserves.

* Coinbase posted a blog titled ‚ÄúHow crypto companies can provide proof of reserves‚Äù. 
* TLDR: Coinbase as a public company already provides proof of reserves using audited financials and will be exploring crypto-native methods to prove reserves. On-chain accounting is the future.

[**Œû300k staked over last 10 days** ](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1596325260650942466)

* A lot of ETH has been pouring into staking and the reason could be the doubled APR(8-9%).
* $stETH, $rETH, $cbETH are only at a slight discount and if people really wanted to exit staking then there wouldn‚Äôt be more ETH coming into the staking pool.
* The majority of ETH stakers bought ETH at a higher price than the current price, unlikely that the stakers sell here and capitulate.

[**Radxa Rock5 for running validators** ](https://twitter.com/marceaueth/status/1597251242194980866)

* Radxa Rock5 board can easily handle a fully subscribed ETH node with hundreds of validators.
* Hardware: - [Computer](https://ameridroid.com/products/rock5-model-b?variant=39918166573090): $220, [SSD](https://amazon.com/dp/B099RHVB42):      $166.
* Software: - Geth for execution - Nimbus for consensus - Rocket Pool for client management.
* Anyone can run an Ethereum full node on consumer hardware.
* A tiny compact device sitting on your desk could have 100 validators and one could run their own proof-of-stake farm but this is unimaginable with Proof of Work.

ethereum,"The entire reason cryptocurrencies were created to begin with because of centralized institutions like banks and governments taking control through financial means.

These centralized exchanges and other CeFi platforms aren‚Äôt any different.

They have full control over our hard earned funds and can legally do whatever they want with them. This is not to mention that they‚Äôre regulatory compliant meaning the government can basically tell them what to do.

How did it come this far? Ethereum and its dApps are a thing for a reason.

Why use a centralized exchange when DEXs are a thing especially when you take into consideration that they come with many more perks.

The ‚ÄúDeFi is expensive‚Äù arguments had long been dead with the advent of L2s and other scaling solutions.

The OGs like Arbitrum and Optimism are there for a reason. And now you got Ethereum based organizations like BitDAO investing hundreds of millions of dollars into scaling solutions which resulted in L2s like Mantle with hyperscalability features for dApps and Web3 tech.

I‚Äôd hate to see all of this R&amp;D money being wasted while we invest more into centralized exchanges.

Why dont we take advantage of all of this tech and the fact that L2s have become way more powerful, and start investing in DeFi instead??

ethereum,"I recently read an article about an NFT gaming survey, the results of which were quite shocking. Only 52% of mainstream gamers are unfamiliar with any Web3 gaming term, according to the survey. Only 12% of gamers have tried a Web3 game and only 15% of those haven't wanted to try one.  


It's evident that one important factor is a lack of comprehension and engagement with the complex world of Web3. For example, only 6% of mainstream gamers have ever used a blockchain wallet or purchased an NFT.  


I must admit that I encountered some difficulties when I first began playing these games, but they were not insurmountable. In fact, I had the good fortune to begin playing WAM tournaments, which have an extremely user-friendly interface and platform. I'm not sure if it varies by game.  


What was your first experience with blockchain gaming? Do you enjoy playing blockchain games? Are you familiar with the terms used in Web3 gaming?  


Improving the first-time user experience is critical to the growth of the industry. According to game developers of all stripes, the FTUE is the best predictor of whether a player will stay and play or leave, never to return.

Metamask and most of your governments collect IP addresses for everything you do online. NP, use a VPN right? What happens if your VPN hands your data over or gets hacked?  
Following the wake of FTX, I want to remind everyone that supporting cryptocurrency is about supporting the decentralization of finances, power, control and influence. There isn‚Äôt blood in the streets because of Uniswap (decentralized) it‚Äôs because of FTX (centralized AKA corrupte3.) These people are vampires!  
Unfortunately, VPN services are almost mandatory for many internet and crypto users now, due to B.S. restrictions put on the internet by people that **want to control you**.  
Like most things that are centralized, VPN services get hacked, exploited or simply hand your data over to the government [all of the time](https://cybernews.com/security/one-of-the-biggest-android-vpns-hacked-data-of-21-million-users/).   
For these reasons, I have been using a decentralized VPN called Mysterium VPN for the last two weeks with very impressive results! Here is what I‚Äôve found:  


* Speeds are wholly compatible with mainstream VPNs.
* Over double! The choice of servers vs NordVPN (probably due to the fact nodes can be run on almost any device.)
* On that note, VPN servers are run primarily from residential I.Ps, instead of Data centre I.Ps. This makes them far harder to detect as a VPN, instead of just a regular home user. 
* Pay with Crypto, fiat (ew), Paypal (Musk level ew) 

Due to my good experience with Mysterium Network so far, I will be exploring the decentralized VPN world further as a token holden and probably node running soon as well. Other projects I don‚Äôt know much about but are on my radar are Sentinel (cosmos) and Orchid (ETH). If you haven‚Äôt tried a decentralized VPN like MYST, support Crypto and freedom by giving them a shot instead of a scummy centralized provider like NordVPN!","I have been using a decentralized VPN on Polygon for over 2 weeks now.

Do you play some of these play to earn games on your phone?  


I believe GameFi is becoming increasingly popular on mobile devices. I began playing WAM on their site, which currently has over 3.5 million users, according to the official website, and the platform's mobile app, which is available for download on both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, has been downloaded more than 180,000 times since its release. These numbers, I believe, will grow significantly over time.

ethereum,"We invented a new order book model, significantly reducing resource consumption compared to the traditional CLOB model; that makes it possible to run a fully functional order book system as a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain while making the gas cost comparable to that of AMMs. We have named this novel order book trading protocol the ""Gridex Protocol"". 

**Key Features:** 

1. Fully on-chain: Deployed and run on the Ethereum mainnet just like Uniswap.\* The entire transaction process is executed on-chain, with no deposit or withdrawal process needed.   
 
2. ""Maker Orders"" in our protocol have introduced a new infrastructure to the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing users to place orders of any size and price while having a zero-slippage and low-cost (even negative-cost) trading experience.   
 
3. Most of our native tokens (GDX) will be rewarded to community users in just over a month before and after the launch. 100% of the protocol fees will be used to buyback and burn GDX. 

*\*The Gridex Protocol will also be deployed on mainstream generalized layer 2 networks of Ethereum, such as Arbitrum and Optimism.* 

**Next Steps:** 

1. Smart contracts are undergoing final optimizations, which will be open-sourced next month with the testnet launch. 
2. The airdrop will begin shortly. Follow the official Twitter for the latest updates.

ethereum,"Gas usage on Ethereum layer 2 networks reached an all-time monthly high. Year on year, the figure has increased by roughly 300%.  


The Ethereum network is experiencing increased layer-2 activity, as the amount of gas spent on the network has reached an all-time monthly high. Over 103 billion gallons of gas were consumed in November 2002, a significant increase from 33.2 billion at the start of the year.  


The amount of gas used to settle layer 2 transactions on Ethereum has roughly tripled year over year. With the exception of a few blips when the market crashed, this activity has been increasing in 2022.  


I've been thinking like, this is a milestone for Ethereum, because only six months ago, the value was at half the current amount and November was the first time that layer 2 networks consumed well over 100 billion in gas.   


For gas fees I always used Metis, it's necessary to use L2 protocols. I didn't even try anything else even though there are plenty of solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum, dYdX, Starkware, and Loopring. How about you, what do you use?  


Overall, layer 2 gas use is expected to increase by approximately 170% in 2022, which bodes well for the crypto market. Adoption of these solutions has risen dramatically in the last 18 months, with low gas fees and quick transactions attracting entities.

""In this video, I discuss how Ethereum continues to betray cypherpunk ideals around freedom and privacy, including the latest ConsenSys policy change that now allows Infura nodes to log users' IP addresses and connect them with Ethereum addresses whenever they make a transaction using Metamask.

In addition, Ethereum validators continue to actively enforce US government OFAC censorship with 75-80% of blocks.

This is what happens when running your own node is not part of your crypto's culture-- you end up outsourcing all privacy to large corporations like ConsenSys.

I am wondering what is your interpretation of how Cryptos like Ethereum, Bitcoin and a Layer two like Loopring behave by supply and demand in contrast to the actual stock market?

Until now I have the feeling the whole crypto space is as much or even more manipulated than the stock market. I really wish there was a way to have a crypto currency which can't be as easily manipultated by big whales. Somehow supply &amp; demand seems to be broken in the stock market, best example is the gamestop stock where they can infinitely create synthetics and short the stock down. Does this apply to cryptos as well? 

Does anyone know how they manage to artificially increase the supply and lower the prices? Do they have the same manipulation power than in the classic stock market? Do you know of a project that could actually resolve this issue?

NFTs can also be used for charitable purposes, such as raffling off an NFT artwork or other asset by a celebrity or brand. The proceeds are then donated to a deserving charity.  


Because NFTs can represent almost anything, their applications are virtually limitless. People are only now realizing the true potential of NFTs, and we can expect to see a wide range of innovative and fantastic applications.  


NFTs are even becoming one of the primary asset technologies in a variety of metaverses. This makes them critical for the internet's future, Web3.

ethereum,Back in 2017-2018 I was mining ether to a software wallet called MIST.  I stopped mining for various reasons after getting about 5 eth.  Last year I tried accessing my wallet but Mist wouldn't connect to the Blockchain because the software is apparently no longer supported.  I'm not sure if the key that I used with the mist wallet was specific for that software (in which case the chances I will be able to access these coins is slim) or if it is the same key I need to access my coins directly on the blockchain.

Despite significant progress in recent years, scaling the Ethereum network remains difficult. Which L2 solutions do you use to address the issues presented by ETH?  


L2 solutions ZK Rollups will be the foundation of Ethereum's go-to strategy in the near and medium term, according to Vitalik Buterin. What are your thoughts on the subject?  


Working without Metis, Arbitum, Polygon, or any other long-standing L2 solution has become nearly impossible.  


Scalability is provided by the L2 chain, which allows for faster, cheaper transactions while retaining the primary security of the L1 chain. Protocols frequently use L2 to increase scalability by processing transactions off-chain and sending only essential data back to the mainnet. When trading derivatives, an L2 provides more leverage, more liquidity, and lower transaction costs than an L1. Users must be able to bridge back and forth from Ethereum without any lag or reliance on liquidity providers for it to be effective.

Gemini claims that their lending business is completely separate from their institutional custody business which they claim is supposedly safe from¬†this whole FTX mess because it's held in trust and regulated by banking law etc. Supposedly if Gemini dies, the securities would be returned to me if the company isn't bought by another like any other stock or ETF.

Quick bit of background, Im a college student who's been in crypto seriously for about a year. 

The fundamental difference between this and the fiat system is custody over keys and one of the big barriers IMO is people being afraid to store their own keys. So I've come up with an ""insurance"" protocol for your keys. 

Essentially, I want to know what people think about an open source protocol idea I have. Simply speaking its a way to back up your keys by encrypting them with information only know would know and then storing this on the blockchain.

A basic illustration could be, I could take my keys encrypt them with my bank details, passport number mothers maiden name etc.  and store that (on chain). I would also have some record of what I have used for the encryption i.e.e mothers name bla bla bla. 

Obviously the stuff you encrypt it with has to be stuff you won't forget in 50 years and that only you should know (I have a list of such things)

ethereum,"Planning on building some opensource software/ smart contracts - trying to see if my protocol is well thought through - feel free to shit on it

Motivation

A lot of people getting into crypto are concerned about losing their keys/hardware wallet. Balancing losing your keys with them being easily found is a tough line to draw. I‚Äôm going to propose a protocol to securely ‚Äúback up‚Äù your keys, and I wanted opinions on it.¬†

The goal is to accelerate crypto mass adoption by ensuring non crypto fanatics can trust that they wont chuck their life savings away on a piece of paper in a recycling bin.¬†

Requirements

I‚Äôve spent a while thinking about the necessary requirements of a good system and my proposal is centered around the following requirements so I‚Äôd be appreciative of criticism of the requirements as they greatly affect the proposal.¬†

Security Standards

1. Independent of any 3rd party (obviously). This has 2 parts. Firstly, you do not rely on a 3rd party to access said protocol. Secondly, no 3rd party can access your keys under any reasonable circumstances, for example an authenticator app could be hacked.¬†
2. At least (but realistically better) than bank security. So it should be more difficult for a hacker to access this than your bank account
3. Anonymous - full anonymity (preview: zk proofs, encryption)
4. Open source - all crucial code should be held within smart contracts that does not require front end software to function

I also came up with some practical requirements for this to work.¬†

1. Proofs must be timeless - i.e. something as simple as your car registration plate is insufficient as this could change
2. Proofs must be easy - there must be zero ambiguity in what you need to provide, including details like formatting¬†
3. Proofs must be accessible - there must not be any doubt that the seeker should be able to recover their keys in an emergency
4. Proofs should be editable - in case situations change
5. Contain redundancy in case some information is for whatever reason lost.¬†
6. Must not be biometric - not easy to prove - not standardized means to measure it, not easily always accessible (lets say in 50 years who knows if fingerprint id will be a thing)

Encoding

Encoding contains 3 stages. 1) public id. You enter 5 pieces of publicly identifiable information (PbId) from the stage 1 list and encrypt this using a symmetrical hashing algorithm¬†

¬†in 3s creating 5C3 = 10 combinations of information. Each is stored in Mapping 1 along with a signed version of this information.¬†

2) Private identifiers. You enter as many pieces of (PrId) from the stage 2 list and encode these in triplets using a symmetrical hashing algorithm. Next you encrypt this with Decryption Key 1 (D1)¬† which must start with a hexadecimal representation of your public key and be 44 characters additionally long. You store this with your public key in Mapping 2. So each address corresponds to a list of encrypted data.¬†

3) Personal Identifiers (PerId). You can now create and answer and provide a hint to personal questions and encrypt these with D1. You then hash your private key/mnemonic with D1 and hash the result with each combination of X answers. You then store these in Mapping 3 as a list of hexadecimals.¬†

Decoding

First you select 3 pieces of PbId to hash and find the signed version from M1. You then recover your address using any Zero Knowledge algorithm (to preserve anonymity) and check if your wallet is of value before continuing.¬†

You repeat the process with PrId and recover D1.¬†

You repeat with (PerId) and combine with D1 to recover your private key.¬†

Lists

I've been wondering since there are not as enough players as there should be, how can crypto gaming ecosystems become more resilient?  


Some critics say blockchain games aren't fun to play because they focus on monetization too much. Would you agree with that?  


That is certainly true for some of the first-generation blockchain games, where developers were clearly more concerned with the crypto-earning aspect than with actual gameplay value.  


Since then, developers have realized that maintaining a sustainable blockchain gaming ecosystem necessitates more than just the ability to earn, it necessitates an engaging core game design and gameplay mechanics that can keep players hooked and spending time on the game, in addition to a simple desire to earn.  


I played numerous of these games because I'm a huge fan of video games and I'm always eager to try something new, there are only a few that made me entertained, Splinterlands, WAM tournaments and Axie but only at the beginning.   


Some pay-to-win games are based on unsustainable tokenomics. Another common criticism leveled at the earlier generation of play-to-earn games is that they attract players based on ""Ponzinomics,"" in which the earnings of players who joined the game earlier are dependent on the ability to sell NFTs or tokens to new players.

ethereum,"Hear me out before burning me at the stake here. There are many assumptions taken in this post (OS, clients, fallback clients, etc.) and even more edge-cases that refute my thoughts. This post is intended to shed light on a general case that may apply to many validators, if not most, given it would seem to affect vanilla validator configurations.  

&amp;#x200B;

Validator uptime is a publicly discernable attribute through missed-attestations, and as anybody running a validator should know, critical node maintenance like security updates oftentimes require a system restart that would result in publicly viewable downtime. If I was a malicious actor that wanted to attempt to gain access to validator keys by compromising these nodes, then this uptime metric could provide me a fast and easy ""short list"" of validators that *likely* have not gone through this maintenance effort. I could even rank my list depending on how long the validator has been online, targeting nodes that *potentially* have not been restarted in months (or years) with the assumption that security exploits are more effective on these nodes..

&amp;#x200B;

Missing a few attestations is relatively painless from a financial perspective. If a node operator is hellbent on not performing maintenance on their system for whatever reason, would it make sense to ""pay"" a few cents each month and create a script that would cut network activity to the node for a few hours at the end of every month? If it were me, I think I would pay this low cost to avoid being placed on the malicious actors short list.

ethereum,"üëã Hello everyone,

I would like to share with you my project that I've developed for a customer.

The project purpose is to manage a variable number of pre-sales / seed sales rounds.

&amp;#x200B;

This project contains the Smart Contract written in Solidity and ready to be deployed on EVM Blockchains (Ethereum, BSC, Cronos, ...)

&amp;#x200B;

Here below the main features:

\- ‚úÖ Manage a pre-sale / seed sale

\- ‚úÖ With only one smart contract is possible to manage multiple sale rounds for potentially multiple tokens

\- ‚úÖ Configurable sale round start and end date time

\- ‚úÖ Configurable vesting start time, cliff and period

\- ‚úÖ Configurable number of tokens to be sold

\- ‚úÖ Token claim is allowed only after the sale round is completed and can be configured also a cliff period (not mandatory) to allow claim in small portions over a certain period of time

\- ‚úÖ Configurable token to be claimed

\- ‚úÖ It is not necessary to develop the token to be claimed before sale round starts, this will give you more time to think about tokenomics and feature of your ERC20 token that will have to be developed.

\- ‚úÖ It is possible to invest into the sale round with stable coins such as USDT, USDC, etc... (requirement of 6 decimal digits per ERC20 token)

\- ‚úÖ It is possible to invest into the sale round with Ethers (it depends from which blockchain is deployed the smart contract, so it would be ETH for Ethereum Blockchain, BNB for Binance Smart Chain, CRO for Cronos, etc...)

\- ‚úÖ It is possible to change parameters when the sale round has already started

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got my Metamask wallet hacked for some reason, and I would like some help on figuring out how it was hacked , and how to move my tokens to a new wallet.
I'm kind of experienced in the crypto world, so I wouldn't make mistakes like sharing my passphrase or putting it in my PC, clicking on phishy links, etc. I even looked up my MM permissions on revoke.cash and I had unlimited spend enabled on Uniswap only. Are there any other ways I could have got my wallet hacked? 
2) Thankfully the hacker didn't care much about my tokens( or most likely didn't notice them at all) so I took all my USDC and USDT out from the polygon and arbitrum networks. My issue lies in the Eth mainnet, I mean I don't have much money in tokens there(less than 40$), but I still would like to move them out, even with fees being so high. I also would like to move all my NFTs from pologon to a new wallet. So is there anyway to batch-send tokens and NFTs on ethreum mainnet and polygon?
3) Could you please offer some advice on how to protect myself from MM hacks? I'm really stressed out, like I'm trying to install linux alongside windows to protect myself from viruses and whatnot, and it feels bad getting your hard earned coins robbed. 
4) I have some ETH tokens that I couldn't sell on Uniswap before getting hacked due to low liquidity. Is there anyway to know when a token can be easily tradable on Uniswap? The ones I'm talking about average 3k-5k trading volume a day on Uniswap, which is pretty low I guess.

It's important to note that a blockchain's ""profitability"" is not the same as a company's profitability in traditional finance. Technically, subtracting new issuance from fee burns allows us to determine whether or not the network is profitable.   
 

So, as far as I can tell, the blockchain's profitability benefits neither its holders nor new investors. Deflation, on the other hand, has the potential to be a significant speculative growth factor for cryptocurrency in the future.   
 

However, while the rallying Ethereum will benefit investors and traders, dApps users and developers will be forced to make transactions with higher fees and possible network congestion. Unfortunately, during high network loads, Ethereum requires users to pay up to $15 per network operation.   
 

I remember at the beginning it was quite chaos dealing with transactions and gas fees, I started using Metis from the start, and the discovery of L2 solutions was the greatest discovery for me as far as I can tell lol.    
 

Various foundations and projects, however, are constantly working on Ethereum's scalability by offering new mechanisms for processing transactions or alternative Layer 2 networks that take some of the load off the main network, offering higher throughput, shorter processing times, and low fees.",Ethereum turns into first profitable blockchain from Top 10 of Crypto Market,1.0,1,yxtllm,RainMateriall,0,2022-11-17 15:47:42,1668700080,1669820703,2022-11-17,15:47:42
ethereum,"Have you heard that the area of the metaverse dedicated to entertainment, including virtual concerts, video games, and movies, will grow to $28.92 billion in value from 2021 to 2026?   


The report states that 33% of this growth will originate in U.S. markets, due to the intersection of gaming and film companies.  


The metaverse and its future adoption continue to be a matter of active research by market forecasting companies.   
What do you think of Metaverse, have you tried it out yet, and are you willing to use it?  


The report identified two key areas that will drive this growth, including rising consumer spending on virtual concerts and virtual events enabled by advances in VR and AR technologies. The second important factor is the growing popularity of online gaming, which, when combined with the aforementioned technologies, provides a level of immersion that will encourage spending in this area.  


I'm always for a good blockchain game, I dunno will I start playing them in the Metaverse, but I'm always in a good mood for WAM tournaments or something like that.   


According to the study, the United States will account for the majority of projected metaverse growth due to a combination of factors. The ""rapid convergence of the entertainment industry and traction of the gaming culture, the integration of gaming services into the service offerings of major entertainment brands, and increased investment to create more immersive gaming and entertainment experiences"" are expected to account for 33% of the increase.","By 2026, the entertainment metaverse is expected to grow to nearly $29 billion, fueled by consumer spending",1.0,1,yxthlq,CombTimee,0,2022-11-17 15:43:04,1668699797,1669820704,2022-11-17,15:43:04

Football Cup Win is a fusion of the football game and blockchain technology. We want to design a platform that allows our community to interact personally with the 2022 FIFA World Cup in addition to NFT collection and staking. Our network's integration of live match broadcasting and a carefully thought-out Join-to-earn approach will help us achieve our aim.A computerised betting system that allows the audience to wager on the teams and players is integrated into the earning mechanism to enable the user to earn unlimited returns.

**Staking:**

FIFACup staking pools offer safer and higher returns up to 11,000% APY.

**Governance:**

Through decentralized governance, token holders will be able to vote on proposals relating to tokens.

**Game:**

The FIFACup NFTs card-based game let‚Äôs you form your own teams or a certain position holder of another team and compete with opponents for game rewards.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is FIFACup?**

FifaCupWin is a DeFi protocol that serves as a bridge between the blokchain tech and Football. Using this portal, the community members can enjoy Fifa worldcup 2022 matches online and earn some rewards by betting on their favorite teams and players.

We offer you a handful of earning options:

* Live-match streaming and Betting system
* Fifa NFTs trading through our Marketplace
* FCW token staking &amp; NFT staking
* NFT card competition game
* DAO and governance modelling

&amp;#x200B;

**Player NFTs:**

Every player in the game is created and given a unique identity using NFT technology. NFT tokens are used to store players. These can be produced by minting or purchased at NFT marketplaces (in-game or external). Data from each NFT is available to everyone. Users can examine the NFT's looks and look up a player's performance and health information. Users can explore through any health ancestry using fitness trees.

**The Betting mechanism:**

We introduces a new betting model that doesn't involve traditional bookmarkers. Our betting mechanism is based on an open-sourced model that involves the blockchain. Online sports betting sites don't have an actual owner that is running the platform, hence our model supercedes the market for online betting in a sense that we projects an open-sourced model through the integration of blockchain.

And a safe option of utilizing your crypto assets for earning safely through the underlying blockchain tech.

**Earn by betting üí∏**

But!!! Thats not it. FCW is not your regular online betting platform. We offer you an exciting betting module. Where you can bet on your teams prior to the match or you can also bet on your players during the match in a live betting system.

**How to bet???**

Betting is all fun and games, until you start losing money. We don‚Äôt want that for you. So here we are sharing a brief module of our go-to strategies for safe betting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rule ‚Ññ1: Learn everything you can about The Game!**

Know Football! As simple as that. Learn everything you can, become a football encyclopaedia wizard. Knowing the game is the first and the most important strategy to excel in the sports betting industry. Since, you will be betting on a live game, happening in the real world, stimulated by real-world factors; it is advisable to learn the game, and do your own research that can contribute to the winning of any team!

**Rule ‚Ññ2: Take some expert advice!**

Take expert advice! Follow credible sources which provide brief information about team performances. Take suggestions from at least three experts, and follow the majority opinion. But don‚Äôt be too blinded by the crowd.

**Rule ‚Ññ3: Never bet with your heart!!!!**

Don‚Äôt do that, I repeat don‚Äôt *do* that!!! Stay clear-headed and bet with a clear understanding of all facts. Maybe write down the information and place it on a table for a clear view and a clearer understanding.

Put your betting on pause when you feel your emotions are getting the best of you and return when you feel more rational.

**Rule ‚Ññ4: Bet like a Pro**

The only way to bet like a pro is through knowing your market, as you already did. But it‚Äôs not just about *Football*. Know the financial aspect of it too. Strategies that tell you how to mitigate loss, or maximise returns.

*Pro tip:* Since FCW offers you two betting options, you can use both to counter bet, consequently to mitigate loss. Here‚Äôs how you can do it.

Suppose person A has placed a bet on Team X before the match begins, Now team X is portraying high stakes of losing the game. Here the loss incurring from the loss of team X is inevitable. However, you can use FCW live betting system for individual players to bet on the players from both teams, team X and the opponent team. This way, you can incur some profit to mitigate the rather inevitable loss.

**Rule ‚Ññ5: Take calculated risks**

Being risk averse might sound boring during the thrilling environment in the stadium, but it is always better to play in the limits. The thrill of the match can sometimes make you believe that a certain team might win, during such times, alway remember the ‚Ññ1 rule of financial wizards: *Never put all your eggs in one basket.* Always diversify your bets. And take small wins, something is always better than nothing!.

ethereum," **Idea: Physically backed Collectibles Marketplace.**

An NFT that represents the underlying Collectible, for example, Air Jordans, Hermes Bags, and Pokemon Cards. This way, people can speculate on the price of these IRL collectibles without having to own the physical product.

How do we work?

Resellers send us collectibles, we verify and once authenticated, mint it. Then these NFTs get traded however they want on chain. Finally, if someone wants to redeem the NFT for the actual good,

**But why would you invest in this NFT instead of the physical product?**

1. Storage: Resellers/Investors have tens of thousands of products and it takes up enormous amounts of space. We solve that by being digital and holding the product for you
2. Slow Transaction speed: Resellers and Investors want faster transaction speeds. Right now each transaction takes weeks accounting for shipping. We shave that time down to seconds
3. High Transaction Cost: StockX, eBay, Goats, etc charge around 20% per transaction due to shipping + authentication costs. We don't need to pay for shipping and only need to authenticate the product once allowing us to lower the fee by half.
4. Poor Authentication: StockX has to authenticate goods every transaction resulting in many fakes slipping through. We only need to authenticate the product once enabling a higher quality and more thorough vetting process.

My first attempt, [Botchi](https://github.com/neauangle/botchi/), was a monolithic bot suite that *works* but it's complicated to use and its reliance on a GUI makes it terrible for running on a VPS. Plus, the bot designer is *fine* but programming languages really are our best tools to define logical flows. I figured it's better to focus on devs- I wrote a high-level library called [Botiq](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botiq) that makes writing crypto bots pretty easy- and then bridge the gap between developers and end-users with something like The Bot Shed.

These sites frequently have a trustworthy and ethical architect in charge of running the bitcoin lottery, thereby providing players with a chance to win big.  


While most websites offer various cryptocurrency options, it is critical to ensure that the website is licensed and regulated, as well as offering the option to use the currency of choice. The more tightly regulated a website is, the more fiat and cryptocurrency options it can offer.

Lotteries powered by a casino that accepts crypto deposits would allow users to play games like blackjack, roulette, baccarat, video poker, and so on.

And while this still might be far from happening, it is the end goal that all of us as a community are working to eventually achieve.

It will take time but the goal is there.

If fact we‚Äôre already seeing decentralized organizations helping out the people who need self governance the most.

Many people living in certain African and Asian countries are under the full control of corrupt tyrannical governments and institutions and thus, Ethereum and Ethereum-based decentralized projects can be the most effective there.

This is very evident by the fact that the MENA region has registered the highest crypto market growth in 2022.

Railgun side says they are legal on their official website. The reason is that if the NTS requests the disclosure of transaction information, you can submit the information in response, so there is no problem.  This is where my curiosity arises.

The NTS has obtained information that the Colombian mafia uses Railgun to launder funds. However, through EtherScan alone, it is not possible to know who the mafia is. So, when Kim Jong-un heard that the NTS was in a state of panic, he was delighted. He paid anyone in Iran through Railgun to buy the equipment needed to build a nuclear bomb. Kim Jong-un tipped Putin and Xi Jinping off about his success. Then the pair, too, happily settled the arms import and export funds needed for the Ukrainian war through Railgun.

In this case, the NTS will come to a boil. Eventually, the NTS will require all railgun users to disclose TXs' information. Doesn't this mean that the Railgun's privacy protection is meaningless after all?

The downfall of both Terra and FTX is sure to ignite the wrath of regulators on the crypto space.

Like you all, I believe that the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies can help to solve a myriad of societal problems. At the same time, having worked in the tech industry for two decades, it‚Äôs also clear to me that radical technologies, like the Internet and cryptocurrencies, do not always evolve in an ideal way.

What I‚Äôm particularly curious about is what a future with Crypto, CBDCs, and inevitable regulations will look like. What will be the role of crypto?

I‚Äôve been thinking about this even more recently, and my conclusion is that, barring an effective banning of crypto (which I believe is pretty much impossible at this point), crypto will serve as both a testbed and release valve for fiat policies.

Consider that Bitcoin started in response to the 2008 financial crisis and exploded in popularity due to unpopular fiat policies, particularly Quantitative Easing. It has also served as an independent safe haven for residents of nations dealing with a failed fiat currency. However, it has (so far) not lived up to the promise of a hedge against inflation.

The advent of Ethereum and unlocking of smart contracts is another great example where cryptocurrencies shined and provided a testbed for financial experiments. This would otherwise have been impossible in a strictly fiat world.

ethereum,"I bet that most of us are using Twitter and we're there getting information about the crypto scene, crypto predictions, NFT use, and new collections. It's like that over a night Twitter became the main crypto social platform. Do you have that feeling too?  


Musk now owns a social network that is used by a large and active online community of cryptocurrency supporters, among whom he has been one of the most outspoken and strange voices. The current health and direction of Twitter under Musk could have a significant impact on a service where crypto promoters promote tokens, developers coordinate software updates, and investors seek information.  


We've all seen Musk demonstrate his ability to move cryptocurrency. He is well-known for causing wild fluctuations in the price of dogecoin simply by mentioning the token. There's also the fact that cryptocurrency was used to fund Musk's takeover of Twitter. Binance, a cryptocurrency powerhouse, invested alongside Musk, giving it a say in reshaping a major social network.  


I'm definitely following the development of ""crypto Twitter"", since I'm curious how will Twitter think about launching its Web3 experiments, I heard that there was a proposal to use NFTs to help establish users‚Äô identities.  


There are actually only a few great uses of NFTs. First, I've noticed that NFTs are most useful in the gaming industry, where their purpose is best served. If you've ever been to WAM, you'll know that it has the highest potential for NFTs, as there are numerous tournaments where you can compete for great prizes, which may be NFTs.  


The second application I adore is the NFT ticketing system, whether for a sporting or musical event. Still, I believe that there will be many real-world applications for NFTs, which is why I'm looking forward to Musk's plans for implementing NFTs on Twitter.

Ultimately I'm building it because I want to see it built, and if someone else steals the idea and builds it that's fine by me.

The core concept of this is essentially a pool/prize, where people can donate money into, and with each donation they can submit a name (string), of a public figure etc.

At the end of some cyclical period. It will tally the string that gets the most 'votes'/'money' put towards it. It will then use some form of consensus algorithm (or possibly another vote,or if nothing else possibly manual trigger by some admin group) ... where the entire pool will be donated to the wallet owner of the name of the string.

The use case is very simple.

It will allow people in democratic countries to lobby (bribe but stfu) politicians in the same way corporations do.

ethereum,"According to CoinMarketCap, the world now has nearly 21,000 cryptocurrencies. This makes determining which ones will be profitable in the long run difficult for investors. But my personal favorite is Ethereum, which is also the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization.  


There are numerous advantages, such as NFTs, because Ethereum is the major blockchain where most of the top-known nonfungible tokens are launched.  


People are excited about Ethereum because the market for NFTs is expected to reach more than $130 billion in sales by 2030, with a 33 percent annual growth rate. This suggests that Ethereum will be in high demand because it is required to pay fees when producing or purchasing tokens on decentralized platforms like OpenSea.  


NFTs can now be used to accomplish a wide range of tasks. As we all know, NFTs offer some people the opportunity to make large sums of money. However, only some people who deal with them become a millionaire. Everyone is unique, and everyone's risk/reward tolerance varies. As a result, depending on one's perspective, NFTs can be viewed as either a lottery or an investment in some cases.  


Regarding NFTs in lottery systems, the lottery industry accounts for 29% of global gambling revenue. This type of ""gaming"" is rumored to be coming soon to platforms like BillionAir, which is powered by a robust token-based economy, the AIRB utility token, and NFT-based tickets. These can be used to participate in raffles, bet, wager on, and win the best skill and chance games.  


Like the crypto scene evolves so quickly, there are more and more opportunities for Ethereum and NFT holders.

ethereum,"Did you ever think about how people decide on NFT prices, or how you price NFTs?  


I've been wondering how some NFTs make money when they sell for as little as $10 and people pay exorbitant fees. That's why I've been thinking about this question.  


Markets for NFTs began to gain traction in 2021, and by the end of March 2021, this new market for digital assets had a total lifetime traded volume of approximately $550 million. Some of the frequently asked questions are, ""How does one price their art?"" and ""What is the best strategy for selling NFTs?""  


Despite the lack of predefined pricing strategies for nonfungible tokens, NFT sellers may choose to sell them at the listing price in a secondary market. Alternatively, they may complete the sale at a price that a buyer is willing to pay, referred to as the buyer price.  


Because of this, gaming NFTs are the easiest to deal with. NFTs can be rewarded with battle gameplay armor, weapons, or who knows what, as in WAM tournaments. As you can see, I'm more interested in gaming NFTs, so I'm not sure how pricing works for different types of NFTs.  


Even so, I believe that if you set your price too high, you risk never being able to sell that item and that if you set your price too low, gradually raising it will be more difficult.

ethereum,"According to Jack O'Holleran, CEO of Skale, a multichain Ethereum native network that powers Web3 games, GameFi's constantly evolving model could make today's AAA game companies look like peanuts.  


Indeed, blockchain-based games and metaverse projects have shown resilience in the face of a winter that has dragged down many players in the crypto industry, raising $1.3 billion in the last quarter, according to DappRadar.  


We are witnessing the birth of many different economies, each with its own distribution mechanism, as well as the evolution of various token models (single token, 2 token, NFT driven, etc.). Only time will tell how suitable and reliable each of these will be in open global markets over the long term.  


There are now different types of these games, you may even play the NFT lottery which I've found out about recently, such a type of gaming will be available soon on platforms such as BillionAir, which is supported by a robust token-based economy, the AIRB utility token, and NFT-based tickets. These can be used to participate in raffles, bet, wager on, and win the best skill and chance games.  


While cryptocurrency gaming companies are gaining a foothold in the industry, AAA games, which are high-budget, high-profile games produced and distributed by large publishers, are attempting to improve usability.  


We see GameFi at a critical juncture. On the one hand, GameFi has the extremely rare ability to attract the next billion users to the crypto space (given how many gamers there are worldwide). Gamification, on the other hand, does not cater to traditional gamers and focuses heavily on the blockchain and the play-to-earn aspect of gaming.

ethereum,"Do you think that most cryptocurrency games today lack the mechanics to keep players interested for even a short period of time?  


I read one interesting article about this and made me think why haven‚Äôt more top-tier games introduced real-world rewards into their games?   


I'm referring to titles in which 99.9% of gamers are not professional esports athletes and receive no monetary compensation for thousands of hours spent playing their favorite games. The possibility of introducing monetary incentives has always been on the table. Why hasn't it been   


Games need to avoid injecting monetary rewards into an experience that is designed to be intrinsically rewarding. The gameplay should be most important because that's the thing that keeps players attracted to the game and entertained. Have you seen how awesome WAM tournaments are? Well, that's the exact reason I'm captivated by that game, it's insane and we need more games that are fun and worth playing.  


The fact is that nobody will invest hundreds of hours in an activity that isn't fun unless it pays a lot of money. And you can only pay out a large sum of money if a large number of users collaborate to create a significant amount of value. This quickly becomes a death spiral for nascent crypto games, as the games are unable to generate enough value to adequately reward players for spending hours inside an unrewarding game loop.  


Instead of starting with economics or haphazardly adding crypto to a working game loop, developers should create games that people want to play. A play-to-earn mechanism could destroy the retention of even a fantastic game with high retention numbers.

ethereum,"1. Definition

The blockchain is operated based on a plurality of nodes configured in a P2P method. Countless transactions are submitted moment by moment from clients all over the world towards countless nodes spread all over the world. The results of these transactions are recorded on all nodes, and in particular, the contents should be the same overall. In order to realize this, the rule that all nodes must follow is the consensus algorithm. To describe it more conceptually,

It can be defined as a method in which a specific node is selected by a certain rule, especially by the decentralization principle, the selection and execution order of transactions is determined by the selected node, and other good willed nodes independently verify and execute the contents of individual transactions and store them in their database.

As such, consensus algorithms can be clearly defined. However, many people are misunderstanding this definition.

2. the subject of consensus

There is a serious misunderstanding about it. 99% of the general public misunderstands this point, and most of the DApp programmers who have not built the mainnet themselves are misunderstood or ambiguous. This is even shown on Ethereum's official website. There is no understanding of the definition of the consensus algorithm mentioned above or it is ambiguous.

[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/)

The fundamental cause of this problem is the illusion about the subject of consensus. In short, even though the content of the transaction, that's, the authenticity of the author is not a subject of consensus, it is often mistaken. The only subjects of the consensus are the selection of transactions and the order in which they are implemented.

A. the contents of the transaction (exactly, the authenticity of the author)

The transaction that ""A sends 1ETH to B"" is electronically signed with a private key and deployed to the blockchain network. The authenticity of the transaction creator is judged by each of all P2P nodes. It doesn't get help from anyone outside, and it doesn't ask anyone outside. However, most ordinary people and surprisingly many DApp programmers mistake the authenticity of the content or the author's authenticity as the subject of consensus. However, this is not the subject of consensus, but of anti-consensus. A famous pharase about this is the following:

""Do not trust. Verify!""

As a result, even if all other nodes in Ethereum conspired to forge the transaction and store it in the database, the honest node does not care about it at all and verifies the transaction by itself and stores it in its own database. And new nodes joining afterwards will follow the honest node.

B. Selection and execution order of transactions

These are the genuine subjects of consensus. No more, no less. Not all transactions submitted to the blockchain are selected, and the selected transactions are not executed in the order in which they are submitted. This is because it is theoretically impossible as long as the concept of a block of finite capacity is premised. Therefore, there arises a problem of deciding how many transactions to accept in one block and in what order to execute them. It is the problem of the consensus algorithm and, in itself, this becomes the definition of it.

i. Selection of Transactions

For example, assuming that suddenly one billion transactions are pushed in one second, it becomes impossible to put them in one block. Therefore, we have no choice but to choose some of them. In this case, most mainnets collect transactions in the order of high gas prices and put them in blocks. Therefore, even transactions submitted first in time may not be included in the block if the gas price is low. They also run later than other transactions with high gas prices even if they are contained in blocks.

For reference, the existing centralized system solves this problem by creating a queue. So even if a billion transactions suddenly hit in a second, it can theoretically accept and process the whole transactions.

ii. Order of execution of transactions

This is also usually determined based on gas prices. Maybe all the mainnets are doing that and I've never heard of that exception. In this case, it is natural that the possibility of manipulation occurs. The answers of existing blockchain protocols to this are as follows.

""Code is Law""

It means that you are responsible for not checking the law in advance. This is simply an irresponsible attitude. For example, if an incompetent legislator incorrectly entered the amount of parking fines and added another zero, the legislator is not at fault and you are an idiot for not checking the law. This is the current state of the blockchain. In the DAO crisis, the law was eventually forced to be revised. Now it should be:

""Law is Code""

The order of execution of transactions must be in the order in which they were submitted. At least they should try to do that. However, the existing mainstream platforms insist that the current gas price auction system is the right way, offering only poor excuses. Of course, everyone knows that it is a lazism.

3. The Birth of the Block Concept

As described above, the current consensus algorithms have a fundamental problem. Nevertheless, the reason Satoshi and Buterin adopted this method was to make ""centralized"" manipulation impossible in the selection and execution order of transactions. That's, they sacrificed the general principle of pre-submissionism to pursue decentralization.

By the way, in order to pursue decentralization in the Satoshi sense, the order of selection and execution of transactions must be determined by a node rather than a specific node. However, if countless clients submit their transactions to a myriad of nodes, the unity of the overall database will be broken if the transactions are executed in the order submitted for each node. Therefore, he was forced to seek ways to select and order transactions by any random node and to allow other nodes to accept them.

To this end, it is needed to establish rules on who will make decisions on selection and who will follow them. As selected by a duly elected selection decision maker, other nodes follow it and execute each transaction and store it in their own database, thereby maintaining the overall database uniformity.

It was the POW that Satoshi came up with as a way to determine who has the authority to make the above selection decision. That means that the person who solves the high-level math problem the fastest will be given the right to decide on the selection of transactions. However, in order to do this, you need time to solve math problems. And during that period, the transaction queue is accumulated. At this point, Satoshi came up with the concept of the very block.

It is the miner who succeeds in solving the math problem. Satoshi established a rule that the miner selects all or some of the transactions accumulated during the period of solving mathematical problems, puts them in one block and executes them, and all other nodes follow the rules. The block concept of blockchain was born in this context.

4. Limitations of the meaning of decentralization in blockchain

As such, the block concept emerged as a methodical element to make it impossible to manipulate in the adoption and order of execution of transactions. It was the best way within the limits of Satoshi's intelligence. The reason Satoshi adopted the block concept was, of course, to achieve the idea of decentralization despite innumerable problems such as the execution delay of transactions during the block generation time, the reversal of the transaction execution order, and uncertainty of being selected in the block. Satoshi believed that decentralization would be guaranteed if a node was selected from among the innumerable good willed nodes spread around the world and those nodes determined the selection and execution order of transactions. And he thought that if only the decentralization was guaranteed, he could endure a number of problems caused by block generation.

If so, it is necessary to calmly examine the advantages of the decentralization compared to the centralization system at the expense of such considerable costs. For this, it is good to make a comparison. In other words, it is assumed that there is one centralized node and that this node determines the selection and execution order of transactions, and other nodes follow suit. Next, the decentralization system is compared with this.

First, there is no difference in the content of the transaction, whether it is a centralization method or a decentralization method. This is because forgery is impossible. Thus, the transaction in which A transfers 1 Bitcoin to B works exactly the same on these two systems and is also stored in the database in the same way. It is also impossible for the centralization system operator to produce the above manipulated transaction from the beginning, and both systems are the same in this respect.

However, there are differences between the two systems in the selection of transactions and in determining the order of execution. The problem is that it is necessary to examine whether the difference is essential or relative. Speaking from the conclusion, the difference is only a relative difference, and in particular, in terms of fairness, that is, prevention of manipulation, it can be said that there is nothing better than a centralized system in a decentralized system. Let's look at this in detail.

The manager(X) of the centralized system can arbitrarily manipulate the selection and execution order of the first transaction in which A transfers 1 Bitcoin to B and the second transaction in which A transfers 1 Bitcoin to C. So if X hates B, loves C, and A's current balance is 1 Bitcoin, X can make the 1 Bitcoin, which is normal to be transferred to B, be transferred to C by manipulating the order of transactions or omitting the first transaction at all.

Satoshi was aware of the above problems, and as a countermeasure, he studied how to empower ""random"" node operators to decide the selection and order of execution of transactions, the result of the study was mining, and the concept that arose as an inevitable result of the mining was the block finally.

At first, it seemed that Satoshi's idea could be realized without obstacles. If there are innumerable nodes and an ""arbitrary or random"" node operator determines the selection and execution order of the transaction, it can be admitted that virtually no one can manipulate it. However, the reality did not go as Satoshi thought. The first typical situation was the emergence of the mining king in China. He was able to exert the power of the operator of a centralized node to some extent based on the enormous hash power. And most of all, the critical scene was the DAO incident. Ethereum Foundation and a series of sympathizers have artificially manipulated the selection and execution order of the transactions to generate an artificial fork. Since then, countless artificial forks have been implemented in the blockchain ecosystem. As a result, Satoshi's logic of decentralization has virtually collapsed. As an inevitable result, the block concept has now fallen into a relative rather than an absolute concept in the blockchain.

In fact, even if it was not the Chinese mining king or the DAO crisis, there was always a possibility of manipulation by ""arbitrary"" node operators. That is the case when a node operator is preparing to manipulate at that time in case he succeeds in mining. If he prepares manipulated codes and allows the codes to be executed when he succeeds in mining or is selected as a validator, he can manipulate them. For example, with simple code manipulation, it is possible to change the selection and order of execution of transactions in a low rather than high order of gas prices.

As such, decentralization through mining and blocks was originally an incomplete method. It was not a digital but an analog concept. That is on a different level from the absolute concept of the impossibility of forgery by electronic signature. And this result applies equally to POS. Whether the stake is large or small, a node operator can manipulate the selection and execution order of transactions as long as he is selected as a validator. But the problems don't end here. It's time to ask a more fundamental question.

Is it reasonable to fundamentally determine the selection and order of execution of transactions based on gas prices? To say the conclusion in advance, it is a manipulation in itself. It's nothing more and nothing less than to benefit someone who has offered more bribes. Let's look at it in detail.

In general, it is right to execute the transaction received first. For example, no matter how much remittance fees are offered to a bank, it never changes the remittance order. Because it is a principle of nature to process remittances in chronological order. There is no reason to treat this principle differently in blockchain. Therefore, if the order is to be reversed, a corresponding unavoidable reason must be presented. Satoshi's answer to this is as follows.

""By extracting transactions in the order of higher gas prices, the platform can prevent infinite repetitive attacks.""

This is not a reasonable presentation. This is a simple security issue and a topic unrelated to decentralization. That's, it is not an issue to be considered in the stage of building the core of the blockchain. That should be considered once the essential structure of the blockchain is completed. In other words, in the core stage, it is right to complete the basic structure so that the transactions are executed in chronological order. Therefore, the infinite repetition attack problem should be considered in the process of considering various secondary problems of the basic structure that has been completed primarily. In the process, it is the right programming mindset to devise and install a new appropriate additional device separately. Also, such a device is easily conceivable. For example, you can find a lot of great methods even at the level of common sense, such as conducting transactions in chronological order, receiving costs in terms of security rather than gas, and returning them if there are no problems later. Unfortunately, it is assumed that Satoshi did not have time to come up with such an idea. As a result, the gas costs were forcibly inserted into the core part of the blockchain under the wrong name. That's, the security costs were inserted under the name of gas costs. The aftereffects of Satoshi's decision on subsequent blockchains were severe.

In conclusion, Satoshi's decentralized method could not achieve its original purpose. The selection and execution order of transactions could be manipulated, and more fundamentally, determining them based on the gas prices is just manipulation in itself. The gas cost priority policy is an unusual manipulation against the common sense that the transaction received first should be implemented first, and the reason for that manipulation was also poor.

In conclusion, it is inevitable to raise fundamental questions about Satoshi's decentralization method, that is, the block method itself. This is not just an issue for Bitcoin, but a problem for Ethereum and all other blockchains.

5. Disappearance of the block

If all transactions can continue from beginning to end without manipulation and the database can be stored equally on all nodes, the purpose of the blockchain is achieved. A curious result emerges here. That is the fact that the concept of a block is not necessary to achieve that purpose. In addition, the fact that none of the existing blockchains achieved the essential purpose of the blockchains mentioned above perfectly, at least satisfactorily, makes us surprised. That means that the block is a failed concept.

As shown by the comparison of the two systems above, it cannot be guaranteed that the decentralized P2P system of Satoshi or Ethereum has special advantages over the centralized P2P system. Instead, by adopting a centralized system, but strengthening the devices that control the central main node to prevent abuse of authority, it is possible to make a more fair and unmanipulatable system than the existing decentralized system. For example, a main node temporarily monopolizes the selection and execution of transactions and is forced to select and execute transactions in chronological order. Then, the other nodes monitor it constantly, and if it operates against principles, disqualify it and appoint one of the other standby nodes as the main node.

In any case, both centralized P2P and decentralized P2P cannot manipulate the contents of a transaction. That's, both methods already have solved the Byzantine General Problem. The remaining issues are of what to select and how to set execution order, but rather, a centralized system can operate them more fairly. The transaction submited first is executed first, and the gas costs may not be received. At last we come to a final conclusion. The concept of the block is removed.

As long as the transactions are executed in the order submitted, there is no reason to divide and put them in blocks. This is no different from executing transactions in chronological order received by banks or credit card companies. They no longer need the concept of blocks.

The concept of the block was only Satoshi's desperate measure, and it is by no means a logically necessary concept to achieve the purpose of the block chain. And the most important fact is that it is desirable to remove the concept of a block as much as possible. Therefore, it comes to the conclusion that the block concept will eventually disappear. The only thing that remains is the transaction chain. Now, the blockchain must be renamed the transaction chain, which will revolutionize the blockchain ecosystem.

6. The Appearance of Nonblockchain

At least it is possible to remove the concept of blocks while maintaining the current level of fairness of decentralization in Bitcoin or Ethereum. More precisely, it means that there are theoretically infinite ways to eliminate the concept of the block to improve the selection and execution order of transactions while securing fairness beyond the current level of the fairness of decentralization in Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Then, what will the consensus algorithm look like if the block concept is actually removed? First of all, the chain is made up of only transactions. This transaction chain also has no fear of forgery, at least in the content of the transaction. As long as P2P is the premise, there is no fear of forgery or falsification of the contents of a transaction, whether it is on a centralized or decentralized system. If so, the only thing left is the selection and order of transactions. Who will decide them? This means going back to the point when Satoshi created Bitcoin.

Based on experience over the past 15 years, Satoshi has failed on this issue for now. Therefore, we must return to Satoshi's initial starting point, even if we don't like that. And we have to start over from scratch. What needs to be observed here is one thing, and that is enough. That's, the level of fairness must be above the current level of Bitcoin or Ethereum. Complete fairness is impossible. It's not impossible in theory, but it's practically impossible unless an innovative new technology like RSA emerges.

The easiest thing to think about is appointing a main node. In appointing the main node, the status may be endowed permanently or only temporarily. The most appropriate answer will be somewhere in the middle of the two. It is virtually impossible to appoint and replace the main node only temporarily, i.e., only once for each transaction. Satoshi was confronted with this very problem. At that time, Satoshi imagined the concept of block, and from this, blockchain was born, and 15 years later, it was confirmed that the concept of block was a failure.

In this case, the most common sense that can be thought of is to appoint a main node under a certain standard and constantly monitor it. As a method, you may use the platform's own code or you may use a smartcontract. And if manipulation or laziness of the main node is detected, a method of replacing the main node automatically or by poll is introduced. Even at this level, the fairness is not inferior to the former Chinese mining king or specific foundation-led artificial fork creation. Above all, this method has the advantage of being able to set the operating standards in advance in a smartcontract. As a result, arbitrary fork generation is fundamentally blocked. This is because the fork generation principle itself that other nodes follow the longest blockchain has been removed. Then, it can be said that it is relatively more fair than the existing decentralization system.

In the end, that can be called Proof Of Democracy (POD). Decentralization, which is less fair than POD, is no longer decentralized. Eventually, the religion of decentralization also collapses. Many people still believe in this myth. It is superstition. Because there is no technical basis. The trustlessness has a technical basis called a electronic signature. However, there is no such definite technique for the permissionlessness, an essential element of decentralization, as demonstrated above. The block failed. The decentralization has failed in both theoretical and practical ways.

Therefore, in this situation, calling for decentralization is nothing more than calling for it as a simple ideology. It is no more than a cry for 19th-century anarchism. Decentralization without technical support is nothing more than a mere cry of ideology. In reality, POW and POS are also fundamentally operated under the control of POD. They are no longer decentralized things. Let's look more specifically.

POW is not a mining certification method but a mining manipulation method, as can be seen from China's mining king. POS is also only a method that can be manipulated by stakeholders. There is currently no technology or method to prevent the manipulations. The DAO crisis and the numerous forks that have been conveniently attempted since then only prove that the blockchain is accepting democracy its ultimate bastion. That is, it may be seen that the POW or POS is only a kind of POD at present. In other words, all existing consensus algorithms are PODs. Pure decentralization independent of democracy does not currently exist. Therefore, the method of selection and ordering of transactions can only be explored based on POD at present.

7. Advantages of nonblockchain

&amp;#x200B;

Satoshi's block ended in failure. However, it has since become the standard for all blockchains. Most blockchains fundamentally do not deviate from Satoshi's basic framework. Eventually, all of them disappear or remain only for museum use. Personally, Bitcoin's block will survive forever. On the other hand, Ethereum is very unstable. There is absolutely no reason to maintain the block concept in the Ethereum camp. Ethereum's attempt to maintain the current block concept is an obvious long-term impossibility.

Nonblockchain has many advantages.

Once you can stick to the principle. That is, transactions may be executed in the order of reception or submission. As in the previous example, if the tree method with the main node as the top is applied, transactions can be executed in the order received by the main node. Furthermore, all transactions can be accepted without omission. This is the same as the queue concept in a general computer OS. There is nothing special.

The nonblockchain would normally adopt a tree structure. Of course, in preliminary, the horizontal P2P method of the current blockchain may be adopted as an auxiliary method. It depends on the mainnet developer's choice. Anyway, if the tree structure is adopted, it can boast the fastest speed theoretically. There can no longer be a rapid structure.

The nonblockchain does not require a concept such as gas price to determine eligibility to be included in a block because the concept of a block does not exist in the first place. It is enough to accept and implement. In fact, the gas costs of existing blockchains are virtually irrelevant to the node's operating costs. This is because the execution of transactions and the storage of data are performed in all nodes, but the gas costs are only probabilistically paid to miners or validators. To be exact, gas costs should be distributed fairly to all nodes. In this respect, the existing gas cost system is extremely unreasonable. Instead, it is desirable to institutionalize a separate method of payment of operating expenses newly, and that is possible, but that will not be specifically mentioned here.

The real purpose of existing blockchains collecting gas costs is not for operating expenses. The mining rewards are sufficient to pay operating expenses. In fact, the real purpose of the gas costs was security costs. This is being confessed by Ethereum's official site.

""In short, gas fees help keep the Ethereum network secure. By requiring a fee for every computation executed on the network, we prevent bad actors from spamming the network. ‚Ä¶ ""

[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/)

The nonblockchain collects security costs, not gas costs. If malicious intent is not positively recognized due to the review, the collected gas costs will be returned. In this way, the security cost may be set high enough without resistance. Eventually, by returning the gas costs, they become zero.

As described above, the advantages of the nonblockchain are considerable, and there are no theoretical or practical obstacles to its adoption, so of course, the existing block concept must be discarded, and a system consisting only of a pure transaction chain will inevitably emerge.

The nonblockchain consensus algorithm is bound to be POD for the time being. For now, we have no choice but to wait for the emergence of consensus algorithms that can achieve decentralization in the true sense by a genius who will appear someday. Until then, it will only be in the form of a POD.

8. Conclusion

The block was just Satoshi's impromptu idea. The necessity for hashes to be contiguous is only between transactions, not between blocks. As a result, the name of the blockchain itself is meaningless. The blockchain is only one method proposed by Satoshi to realize the ideology of the transactionchain. The block is not the truth. The block concept was only one of the myriad ways to realize the transactionchain, and it has now reached the point of disposal. The Byzantine General Problem was not solved by Satoshi but was just a problem that had already been solved by cryptography. It was the electronic signature.

Looking inside the blockchain at the current stage, there are no particularly remarkable technologies other than the electronic signature. Other technologies are only those that have already existed or can be developed by ordinary programmers. It is absurd to try to achieve decentralization with only such poor equipment. In other words, the crypto world at this stage does not have the ability to realize the ideals of blockchain. As an inevitable result, the consensus algorithm cannot go beyond POD. This is the reality of today's blockchain.

But the spirit of commercialism wants to hide these limitations. On the other hand, glorify the block. To this end, they feature the emperor's new clothes. The representative clothes are Ethereum's future plans.

The complexity of this plan is indescribable. The complexity was all caused by the concept of the block. These are temporary complications that will all disappear when the block concept is removed or at least a fundamental platform that heals the problems appears. For the time being, of course, they are successful in dazzling people.","The Fictitiousness Of The Consensus Algorithm, The Failure Of Decentralization, And The Emergence Of Nonblockchain (The content is very long.

ethereum,"Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital and short-time Trump communications director, spoke on CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box Friday morning about friend and business partner Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of the crumbling crypto exchange FTX.

FTX, which took a 30% stake in Scarmucci‚Äôs SkyBridge Capital in September, is facing potential bankruptcy after a ‚Äòbank run‚Äô on the crypto exchange left it about $8 billion short. Bankman-Fried says he was unaware of the extent of user leverage because of poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts.

Anthony Scaramucci was hesitant to attribute the exchange‚Äôs failure to malice.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to call it fraud at this moment because that‚Äôs actually a legal term,‚Äù Scaramucci said. ‚ÄúI would implore Sam and his family to tell the truth to their investors, get to the bottom of it.‚Äù

Bankman-Fried tweeted Thursday morning that he is ‚Äúsorry,‚Äù admitting that he ‚Äúf---ed up‚Äù and ‚Äúshould have done better.‚Äù

Bankman-Fried said his first mistake was poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts, which meant that he was ‚Äúsubstantially off‚Äù on his sense of users‚Äô margin. ‚ÄúI thought it was way lower.‚Äù

Scaramucci speculated that Bankman-Fried could have made mistakes in the throes of the crypto bear market, specifically when Three Arrows, a massive cryptocurrency hedge fund, liquidated in June 2022.

‚ÄúWhen Three Arrows went down, it could be possible, Andrew, that Sam had difficulty then, and then he made some decisions that turned out to be disastrous for him and both sides of this business,‚Äù he said Friday, speaking to CNBC‚Äôs Andrew Ross Sorkin.

Scaramucci told Squawk Box that we went to the Bahamas to help Bankman-Fried as an investor and friend. When he got there, he says, it appeared beyond the point of a simple liquidity rescue.

Binance seems to have made the same assessment. The world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency firm broke a non-binding deal to rescue FTX after conducting due diligence and the news ‚Äúregarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations.‚Äù

Scaramucci said he didn‚Äôt see evidence of this mishandling when he and other investors first screened FTX as a potential business partner.

‚ÄúDuped I guess is the right word, but I am very disappointed because I do like Sam,‚Äù Scaramucci continued. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what happened because I was not an insider at FTX.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of distress in the markets, and a lot of my friends think it‚Äôs the worst week in cryptocurrency history,‚Äù Scaramucci said.

Scaramucci said he plans to buy back his equity in SkyBridge from FTX, noting that his firm did not hold assets at FTX due to a potential conflict of interest.

ethereum,"We are all aware that, despite being the leading blockchain for developing decentralized apps, Ethereum is frequently chastised for high gas fees and slow transactions; even if the merger occurred, there are some things that should be done.  


Do you use any tools to help you deal with all of these ETH issues? Last week, I read an online article about Layer 2s, and there are a couple of great solutions, some of which I've tried and some of which I'm currently using, which is the scaling protocol Metis. It helps with all of these issues, such as high gas prices and slow transactions, which are, as previously stated, characteristics of ETH.  


Since I read about these protocols, solutions, and all the needed help with problems we're dealing with using ETH, I'd like to know a little bit more about it from your personal experience.  


Are you satisfied with the Merge after some time has passed? What did you expect, and did it meet your expectations? How do you deal with all of the other ETH issues that every holder/trader faces?  


I should mention that the Metis platform has a variety of use cases, including assisting users in developing their own NFT minting, yield farming, which I've been using as well, and DEX, which is fantastic, so there are some reasons why this platform appears trustworthy to me.

ethereum,"Ethereum is a public ledger and by its design, it‚Äôs meant to be transparent. However, there is confusion about it being anonymous because many people still believe that the blockchain in general is anonymous, which is false. Anything can be tracked on the ledger, including the details of every transaction and deal you‚Äôve made since you started trading. It may not be a big deal to some, especially to those who don‚Äôt understand that their personal privacy can easily be violated as a result of this. 

People are starting to realize that there is a big privacy gap in crypto. This has been amplified by the disturbing push for the adoption of CBDCs by the government which will give them some level of control over the finances of the general masses. Zero-Knowledge proofs have been cited by many to be revolutionary, especially when it comes to building privacy tools.

ZKPs are encryption schemes in which a party who is a prover proves their case of truth concerning specific data on the other party,a verifier without revealing the information. Here are few of the projects that have worked around the technology to build an important utility- privacy in crypto.  

1. Aztec offers users privacy utilizing layer 2 solutions, specifically the zk rollups system. Users send transaction requests to Aztec and the transactions are then put into a batch, and rolled up with other users' transactions, which can lead to a longer processing time but has privacy baked in at a base layer. 
2. Railgun is a privacy-preserving smart contract wallet developed on Ethereum and uses zk-SNARKs to obfuscate transaction details and make anonymous transactions of any Erc 20 tokens or Erc 721 tokens. Users also get privacy at rest, meaning they can keep a private balance which wasn‚Äôt possible on previous L1 privacy protocols.It works by removing all identifying information from transactions. It‚Äôs similar to a MetaMask or any other wallet, just with privacy preserving zk-SNARKs in place.
3. Zether is a confidential (transaction amounts are hidden) and anonymous (transaction sender and receiver are hidden) payment mechanism on blockchains with an account model like Ethereum. It is implemented as a smart contract called ZSC. One of the major limitations that Zether is known for is that transactions get processed at the end of a current epoch, inferring that it can be quite difficult on a busy network. However, it is quite promising and has everything it takes to be among the major players in private crypto overtime. 

I believe that there are many other ways to keep a private balance on Ethereum. As a privacy maxi, I would love to hear this subreddit‚Äôs thoughts on what‚Äôs out there in this area.  A time will come when privacy will become a big word in crypto and we‚Äôll have the bulk of crypto users keeping their on-chain activities private.",Zero-Knowledge Proofs application in Ethereum,1.0,1,yra2jk,Jacobsendy,0,2022-11-10 09:25:37,1668072348,1669823101,2022-11-10,09:25:37
ethereum,"Last year I sold and rebought any crypto that I was holding for a term loss to offset capital gains. However, I realized I couldn‚Äôt do this with my ETH and other staked assets, unless maybe I bought new ETH, sold it, and claimed it as the higher cost basis lot. Would this be acceptable to our friends at the IRS?

Ex. January 1: Buy 1 ETH at $4,000, then stake. 
Dec. 31st: Buy 1 ETH at $1,000. Sell 1 ETH for $1,000. 
Tax time: Claim 2 ETH bought at above cost bases. Claim 1 ETH sold at $3,000 loss. Keep other 1 ETH at cost basis of $1,000. 

Obviously this is very simplified, and doesn‚Äôt account for staking rewards as income and so on. But does the general principle apply that I could buy and sell a coin in this way to take advantage of the lack of wash sale rule?

ethereum,"I'll try to be short here....

OK...so, this was all the pretext the US gov needed to do all the ultra bad JP morgan coin stuff to us.

Congress is going to be gridlocked. We need to focus on hyper specific clauses and details in the SEC and CFTC to get the commissioners to fix to keep crypto legal in the US, and to limit KYC mandates offshore.

I know it is hard for you guys to believe, but the FTX thing will make the US gov want even more centralized exchanges and even more licensure systesms, these people are going to Boomer and Wallstreet us into oblivion like MT Gox.

&amp;#x200B;

The Elligible Contract Particpant Clause and the alternative trading systems clause need to be fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

The second part is by far the worst.

Right now DC is going to try to mandate VPN detecting api's on all foreign dev/dao DeFi teams, and they're going to mandate 2 or 3 chain hop chain surveillance, block lists and clear lists to catch US IPs and to ban VPNs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look DC has an endgame here, and it is simply prohibiting US citizens from cashing DeFi proceeds out on offramps, simply creating some insane law to give them the power to force Coinbase to do it, they're just going to continue to cite national security risks caused by market instability as a reason to go through with this. 

There also going to make it extremely hard for US citizens to use DeFi because of the chain surveillance happening on the front ends, even quite possibly, I would say likely the backend, where the Dao are forced to block numerous addressed tied to US exchanges from using the Front End.",Emergency Regulatory Game Plan; Predominantly Concerning Front Ends.,1.0,1,yqz9mk,samdane7777,0,2022-11-09 23:40:08,1668037219,1669823199,2022-11-09,23:40:08

ethereum," 

So as a proud Cayman GT4 owner into crypto, ofc this is exciting for me as I've been on the [porsche nft waiting list](https://www.nft.porsche.com/) for a couple months, and today had the email saying minting is live: -**- basically its a free mint on ethereum, and now live at** [https://porsche.com/nft](https://porsche.co.com/nft)  and although im disappointed I only minted a crappy Boxster, it does  seem to offer some real tangible benefits for us Porsche owners, such as  free racetrack entry, discounted services and some other things I  haven't fully investigated yet.

Part  of me is also disappointed in the sketch design - in my opinion it  takes away from the sweeping contours and beauty that only a real photo  can show, just look at a photo of a porsche 959 and compare to the NFT  sketch, i mean yeah, one is exciting, one is.. Dull

On the other hand, it is a nice touch that everything is hand drawn and gives an exclusive feel, for sure.

Also,  its really interesting to see how much the NFT space is growing, and i  think the bear market has really hidden these things out of our view,  and makes us think everything is dying.. sure prices are down but  development is increasing, and adoption is crazy high.

So dont give up on your nfts guys, it is real value and will be a huge part of the world going forward.

ethereum,"NFT lottery is a new way of getting crypto assets for people and earnings for token holders. NFT lotteries operate similarly to traditional lotteries in that participants can buy tickets and wait for the lottery draws to start. The prize winners will then be chosen randomly from a pool of numbers by the provider, according to the number of matching numbers on their tickets.  


I think this type of lottery began popular this year, not so long ago, it's evident because the NFT has reached its peak, and therefore everyone wants to get them literally in any way.  


I didn't know much about it until I learned about this upcoming lottery project called BillionAir. I started checking it out because I needed some type of refreshment, and all games started to look the same. This one attracted me probably because there's gonna be an NFT-based ticket to enable players to enter raffles, as well as a comprehensive token-based economy to allow players to bet, wager, and win in the best games of skill and chance.   


Usually, the NFT lottery has its own rules with different conditions. As a rule, to participate in the lottery, you need a ticket. It can be obtained by playing games, participating in sweepstakes on social networks, or simply purchasing.

ethereum,"Clash card, a mediaeval war culture inspired card-based battle game is now live on the BNB smart chain. The game, which revolves around the combat of two rival kings, takes its inspiration from the clash of clan warriors. The kings, or so you can say: commanders in the game are responsible for the layout of their attack or defence strategies. Based on their battlefield strategy, they set the layout of cards in different layers throughout the battle. This show of powerful cards is the key point of this P2E game.

*Processing img seqlvz1dfxy91...*

**Announcement**

The Clash card P2E game is launching its subscription launch on presale on the **9th of November, 2022. The launch will be live from 14:00 UTC to 18:00 UTC (4 Hours)**

The Clash card team has opted for the subscription sale to ensure a fair token distribution, thus protecting all participants from pump and dump and other artificial price alteration techniques forced by the big whales.

**What is a subscription launch**

Users can commit an amount of BNB to a token sale in the subscription format, and their final allocation of the new token is determined by the ratio of their committed BNB to the total committed BNB by all participating users.

For better understanding, let‚Äôs take the example of a subscription presale with a hard cap of 50 BNB, if one user pledges 50 tokens and 19 other users also commit 50 tokens, then it totals to 1000 BNB in the pool. Each person who commits 50 BNB would now receive 5% of the total collection.

**Calculation of the tokens in subscription launch**

*Formula:*

(No. of BNB allocated by the individual / Total No of BNB collected) \* Total No. of $CLASH tokens to be sold on the launchpad

**\*\*\*** It should be noted here that the participants who allocated more BNB than the prescribed hard cap, will have their allocation passed onto other participants. In this way, on user can hold more tokens than a predefined limit.

**Disclaimer**

This information is neither a suggestion nor an attempt to market the $CLASH tokens. It is shared solely for the purpose of information for the community and the media outlets that are following us.

ethereum,"Gaming used to take place on a regular basis, where you played games one on one with your opponent for fun and recreation, but due to evolution, gaming has moved from one-on-one physical games to the Internet, and from the Internet to the blockchain. Gaming has come a long way, and its value will rise even further as new technology advances.  Blockchain, on the other hand, is now well-suited for the exchange of value and digital assets. 

In the spirit of a trusted ecosystem, both industries and technology require digital assets.  Non-fungible tokens and confidentiality are advantages of Dapps in blockchain games. Some games, such as board games, have solved the majority of global family and domestic problems.¬†For example, friends and family who haven't met in decades can be reunited through board games on the blockchain.  

This is the solution that board games are bringing to our daily lives, and I believe that with the help of Gamestarplus, the pace will be accelerated. Gamestar+ aims to bring board games and other forms of entertainment to the blockchain, rewarding gamers and content creators with their own NFTs.

1. There have been decentralized exchanges before Ethereum. Ripple, Counterparty, Bitshare, etc. But they are not called the first defi project. The title seems to go to MakerDao usually. Is this just an Ethereum-centric view of the history? Or because they failed to lead to a thriving Defi ecosystem? If the latter, what were the problems and limitations?
2. Many people call MakerDao the first Defi project. Is this is thanks to OasisDex or Dai stablecoin? OasisDex was started in 2016 as a dex protocol in Ethereum. MakerDao was started (not sure as a real or a test version) in 2015 with a stablecoin called eDollar, but it seems like the real launch was in 2017 with Dai.

ethereum,"The debate over whether Bitcoin or Ethereum is a better investment continues to rage among communities. This time, it is being tested with MicroStrategy's crypto investments over the years.  


We've all seen that MicroStrategy is currently losing money on the 130,000 BTC that it purchased over the years, making it the public company with the largest bitcoin holdings.  


What do you think would have happened if the company had invested in Ethereum instead?  


I truly believe that Ethereum will soon outperform Bitcoin, even when we face high gas fees, which I resolved with Metis or low prices, I always try to find a solution and remain patient because I truly believe that we will see the full glory of Ethereum sooner or later.  


It is no secret that Ethereum has consistently outperformed bitcoin. So it's not a stretch to say that MicroStrategy would be in a better position if it had invested in Ethereum rather than bitcoin, and the numbers back this up.  


The comparison puts the various profitability levels of both digital assets over the year. Ethereum has continued to outperform bitcoin both in the long and short term. It really begs the question of if Bitcoin is really the best crypto asset to invest in.

ethereum,"The Web3 world has been watching NFTs grow up. These digital assets have evolved from hype-centered digital art collections to utility-focused tools building the next generation of the internet.  


One of the most important utilities of NFTs is that they are increasingly used as the key to communities of the future - both digital and physical.   


Have you ever thought that these incentivized digital assets can take passive fandoms and turn them into active communities, where members own and delegate activity in a living ecosystem? I think this might be pretty cool and useful.  


The gaming industry has probably made the best use of all the advantages of NFTs. Axie showed us a terrific example of implementing NFTs into a game, WAM presented NFTs in a totally different and entertaining manner which I absolutely love.  


It's no surprise that NFTs are often the gateway for many newbies to participate in the Web3 space, as are other avenues such as play-to-earn blockchain gaming.

So as a proud Cayman GT4 owner into crypto, ofc this is exciting for me as I've been on the [porsche nft waiting list](https://www.nft.porsche.com/) for a couple months, and today had the email saying minting is live: -**- basically its a free mint on ethereum, and now live at** [`https://porsche.com/nft`](https://porsche.co.com/nft) and although im disappointed I only minted a crappy Boxster, it does seem to offer some real tangible benefits for us Porsche owners, such as free racetrack entry, discounted services and some other things I haven't fully investigated yet.

Part of me is also disappointed in the sketch design - in my opinion it takes away from the sweeping contours and beauty that only a real photo can show, just look at a photo of a porsche 959 and compare to the NFT sketch, i mean yeah, one is exciting, one is.. Dull

On the other hand, it is a nice touch that everything is hand drawn and gives an exclusive feel, for sure.

Also, its really interesting to see how much the NFT space is growing, and i think the bear market has really hidden these things out of our view, and makes us think everything is dying.. sure prices are down but development is increasing, and adoption is crazy high.

So dont give up on your nfts guys, it is real value and will be a huge part of the world going forward.

Once they have completed the security audit for MPC implementation, they intend to open-source the entire solution. (Including the libraries and the party server implementation). They're working on documenting the entire solution.  

Here's what the tool can help with: 

1. Building an In-App-Wallet, allowing customers to complete purchases inside your dApp, no more jumping between wallet and app. More importantly bypass the app store's 30% fees. 
2.  Provide a second exclusive secure passcode, a wallet you can actually trust 
3. Provide on-ramp service, touch upon both Web 2 and Web 3 customers 
4. Significantly reduce the development time, thorough and professional support from a professional team

ethereum,"The NFT market continues to go from strength to strength, with new and exciting use cases being discovered for these digital assets regularly. For what purpose do you find NFTs most useful?  


Not so long ago I heard that people started to implement them in Lottery systems which have become one use case that has begun attracting attention from certain media quarters, offering users the chance to win different types of NFTs.  


This type of ""gaming"" will soon be available on platforms like BillionAir, which is powered by a robust token-based economy, the AIRB utility token, and NFT-based tickets. These can be used to enter raffles, bet, wager, and win the best skill and chance games.  


Have you tried something like this?   


Tbh, I'm so new to this lottery concept, but as more I read about it I have a huge wish to try it out.

So, I've been on the waitlist (just out of curiosity) for a couple months, and today had the email saying minting is live: -**- basically its a free mint on ethereum, and now live at** [https://porsche.com/nft](https://porsche.co.com/nft) and in fairness, it does seem to offer some real tangible benefits for Porsche owners, such as free racetrack entry, discounted services and some other things I didnt really bother to look into.

But i'm not really sure why a NFT is required for that - it annoys me how these big companies just all making NFTs without really any need for it whatsoever. I mean, if i want a luxury car, i will consider a porsche, i do not want some sketches or collectables.

Anyhow, its really interesting to see how much the space is growing, and i think the bear market has really hidden these things out of our view, sure prices are down but development is increasing, and adoption is crazy high.

So dont give up on your nfts guys, it is real value and will be a huge part of the world going forward.

ethereum,"I'm talking about systems that use trusted execution environments (TEEs) as a basis for building a smart contract platform.

As far as I understand it, Phala (for example) has everything everyone's always wanted but never got from a smart contract platform:

- Privacy: Smart contract data and call parameters are hidden from everyone except the contract.
- Scalability: smart contracts run at native speeds and transactions only need to be executed on a single node (which somewhat solves scalability although transactions that write data are still subject to global ordering which presumably is still subject to some kind of consensus mechanism with all the slowness that entails.)
- Practicality: You can make web calls from within a smart contract, which makes oracles redundant.
- Developer experience: smart contracts written in Rust, a proper programming language.

It's not perfect but it just seems to be much better than anything else out there.

ethereum,"These past weeks have been quite extraordinary.

The federated social network and microblogging system Mastodon has been growing at an incredible rate as users migrate away from Twitter.

We see that it crossed
6,132,414 users today and is growing at over 5k/hour. See here for stats:
https://bitcoinhackers.org/@mastodonusercount

Thousands of new instances are being set up.

This is quite phenomenal for a decentralised, federated network running on open source software, where anyone can run their own ~~node~~ instance.

Academics are coordinating to move to mastodon en masse. Journalists too are moving. A lot of effort is going in to this and a lot of experimentation / hands-on improvisation: They are even passing around text files and google docs full of account names so that people can recreate their twitter networks on mastodon. It's humans instead of AIs suggesting accounts to follow.

This week has seen articles on how to get set up on mastodon in wired, the guardian, time, nytimes, bbc, and more.. (I'll try to edit and add the links later today).

The trigger for this has been the turmoil at Twitter. But whatever the cause, and whatever you think about Elon Musk making Twitter his personal property, I would have expected this community to be excited about a mass movement to Mastodon, and actively encouraging it / joining in. Surely this community understands that a decentralised social network in which moderation is local/opt-in, in which you can move your account to another node at any time and keep your followers, in which you can run your own node, that this is an extremely valuable thing in itself, and that it opens the space up to so much more development, improvement, and experimentation.

Instead, I find that among my followings, everyone except the crypto crowd is trying to decentralise while this community just shrugs.

It might not be a web3 utopia, but its a lot better than one privately owned network. Here is a chance to move things in the right direction... and yet ..

Why? 
Shouldn't we give it a go? Try it out? 
It's open source. Adding ENS authentication is one PR away. Adding IPFS/Swarm support is one PR away. We can even host our own instances to experiment while still being connected to the wider network.

I'd love to see you all over there!

ethereum," 

So, I've been on the waitlist (just out of curiosity) for a couple months, and today had the email saying minting is live: -**- basically its a free mint on ethereum, and now live at** [`https://porsche.com/nft`](https://porsche.co.com/nft) and in fairness, it does seem to offer some real tangible benefits for Porsche owners, such as free racetrack entry, discounted services and some other things I didnt really bother to look into.

But i'm not really sure why a NFT is required for that - it annoys me how these big companies just all making NFTs without really any need for it whatsoever. I mean, if i want a luxury car, i will consider a porsche, i do not want some sketches or collectables.

Anyhow, its really interesting to see how much the space is growing, and i think the bear market has really hidden these things out of our view, sure prices are down but development is increasing, and adoption is crazy high.

So dont give up on your nfts guys, it is real value and will be a huge part of the world going forward.

ethereum,"Mass layoffs are hitting a lot of crypto projects and to try and stay afloat there will probably be an uptick in companies doing shady things. But this will just result in the lie getting covered up and unsuspecting people getting sucked into the scam.  As we continue in a bear market more and more projects are getting squeezed and this could spell a coming disaster for many in the coming months. The analysis that's currently available on a lot of these projects isn't very thorough and there's a lot of information being withheld from the average crypto user. 

I'm the head mod of [r/eth](https://old.reddit.com/r/eth) and sometimes people tell me about shady things going on with certain projects. I was considering putting together a group that analyzes different projects for things like fraud, bad practices, bad financials etc. and figures out which ones are most likely to crash.

ethereum,"Guys, I‚Äôm working on creating a test dapp like a website using one of the various web3 ethereum providers and their API as my web3 project and I‚Äôve been doing only online reading from online platforms. No actual tutor to break things down so it‚Äôs kinda hard. There‚Äôs a lot of learning I‚Äôve done here on Reddit and I hope it keeps being as informative to everyone.
For my test dapp I‚Äôve accumulated functions of relevant codes I‚Äôd be needing but 
I‚Äôd just like to know more about these particular functions and how they work.

Guys, What I really need to know is, after signing a transaction does the  spender who has already been granted access need to do anything else to initiate the transfer from the owner or does the transfer token function have to be in the same codes as the token approval one? Like before deploying your site.

Like, does the token move out after signing immediately or does the spender have to run any other back-end code? I know I‚Äôm saying the same thing but I want someone who gets my actual question. Please and please I‚Äôd be glad if any developers or web3 blockchain programmers can explain better.

Basically for the transfer to happen is the transfer function is called after the message is signed. Been learning programming on my own and if anyone can shed more light I‚Äôd be grateful about how the token approval allowance and transfer functions work and  also, to approve multiple tokens would it be one sign-in message or MULTIPLE sign-in messages for EACH TOKEN approval .","Token approval function, Web3 APIs, website dapps, codes needed and how to incorporate functions like query balances and approvals onClick",1.0,1,yovomo,Even_Manufacturer522,0,2022-11-07 18:27:51,1667845683,1669823975,2022-11-07,18:27:51
ethereum,"For example assets like video games, copyright file for images, illustrator templates, svgs etc. Here on buying a music over iTunes or buying a game over Steam doesn't  mean you own the music or game.

Wide acceptance of such standards can lead to emergence of **open marketplaces**. You can buy music of an open marketplace or even iTunes and play it for no extra cost over Spotify. The chain can act as a prof that you bought a particular music.

Similarly for games, buy on Steam, play anywhere.. Be it PC, online game streaming platforms like GeforceNow, Sony's implementation etc.

Here many assets can be stored on a single contract and singular assets can be owned by many people

Also, the buyers need not be stored on contract storage but as events.

ethereum,"Hey guys! 
I've watched in a video interview of Vitalik Buterin (can't find the video ATM will edit my post as soon as I find it) saying it may be a possibility post merge, that with time, archive nodes forget about unmoved ETH.

(E.g after 5 years, most of the archival nodes will forget the state of your account and your ETH is now unaccessible)

Is this a possibility? If that's not the case can someone explain to me technically (I can handle it)  why it won't happen?

And of course I'll forward you the interview when I find it back.

ethereum,"Digital assets, collectibles, and non-fungible tokens have come a long way in recent years, with more complex use cases and higher utility on exciting new platforms.  


Following a massive influx of users that congested the Ethereum network in 2017, the blockchain gaming industry has been quietly simmering for the past couple of years. However, with recent developments, projects, and collaborations, blockchain in gaming is making a comeback, appealing to a larger audience than ever before.  


Don't you have that feeling as well?  


With the rise of crypto games/blockchain games, there are a variety of ways in which blockchain technology is being used in the gaming industry, such as NFTs, Play &amp; Earn, virtual events, and tournaments, of which WAM has a plethora. I'd say they're pretty exciting and intense, which I enjoy.  


What do you see as the most important thing in these games?  


I would single out that the most important element of Blockchain gaming is in-game economies. Collecting coins, tokens, and points that can be exchanged for better in-game items such as weapons or shields, for example, is a common theme among many major gaming platforms.  


Ofc that gameplay is important as well, but the economics of these games is something that differentiates blockchain games from traditional ones.",Blockchain games are literally changing the game in this industry,1.0,1,yopgal,Carefulip,0,2022-11-07 14:59:29,1667833179,1669824041,2022-11-07,14:59:29

Minus the basics of just learning what Ethereum and the tech actually is, how do you guys go about keeping track of what's happening in the scene?

ethereum," Clash card, a mediaeval war culture inspired card-based battle game is now live on the BNB smart chain. The game, which revolves around the combat of two rival kings, takes its inspiration from the clash of clan warriors. The kings, or so you can say: commanders in the game are responsible for the layout of their attack or defence strategies. Based on their battlefield strategy, they set the layout of cards in different layers throughout the battle. This show of powerful cards is the key point of this P2E game.

https://preview.redd.it/plgcad1xtdy91.png?width=3556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1e4bcb873edd254058a1465a82fa651fe38863d

**Announcement**

The Clash card P2E game is launching its subscription launch on presale on the **9th of November, 2022. The launch will be live from 14:00 UTC to 18:00 UTC (4 Hours)**

The Clash card team has opted for the subscription sale to ensure a fair token distribution, thus protecting all participants from pump and dump and other artificial price alteration techniques forced by the big whales.

**What is a subscription launch**

Users can commit an amount of BNB to a token sale in the subscription format, and their final allocation of the new token is determined by the ratio of their committed BNB to the total committed BNB by all participating users.

For better understanding, let‚Äôs take the example of a subscription presale with a hard cap of 50 BNB, if one user pledges 50 tokens and 19 other users also commit 50 tokens, then it totals to 1000 BNB in the pool. Each person who commits 50 BNB would now receive 5% of the total collection.

**Calculation of the tokens in subscription launch**

*Formula:*

(No. of BNB allocated by the individual / Total No of BNB collected) \* Total No. of $CLASH tokens to be sold on the launchpad

**\*\*\*** It should be noted here that the participants who allocated more BNB than the prescribed hard cap, will have their allocation passed onto other participants. In this way, on user can hold more tokens than a predefined limit.

**Disclaimer**

This information is neither a suggestion nor an attempt to market the $CLASH tokens. It is shared solely for the purpose of information for the community and the media outlets that are following us.

ethereum,"Is there any legal guidance available for US solo staking validators needing to censor OFAC blacklisted Ethereum addresses? My understanding is there is no way to do this in the default vanilla configuration. Instead, you would need to use third-party software by flashbots called mev-boost and then select relayers that state they will be censoring OFAC blacklisted addresses.

I am unable to find much in the way of formal legal guidance re: this obligation. There is some factual evidence for US based validators **not** needing to censor OFAC transaction, but they are all circumstantial. Such evidence includes:

1. Few, if any, Bitcoin miners currently censor OFAC transactions
2. Ethereum miners prior to POS mostly did not censor OFAC transactions. The only exception to this was Ethermine and they did not start censoring OFAC transactions until after Tornado Cash was added a few weeks prior to the merge. There is no indication they censored before Tornado Cash was added to the OFAC list.
3. Even now, many large US -based validators are running vanilla configuration without censoring such as Coinbase, Kraken and [Staked.us](https://staked.us/). Persumably, they would not do so if they thought this was against OFAC regulations.

I am wondering if anyone has any access to any real legal analysis in this regard. My concern would be Treasury (OFAC is a dept of the treasury) would be more likely to target solo validators, to make an example out of them, since they would not have the resoucres to defend themselves than a large exchange or other centralized entity such as Coinbase or Kraken. Then they could use any settlement or conviction as precedent to then go after the larger centralized actors.",Legal Guidance for US Ethereum Stakers re: OFAC Compliance,1.0,1,ynj33r,StableRare,0,2022-11-06 06:51:37,1667717510,1669824459,2022-11-06,06:51:37

The game revolves around rival encounters in different forts, where the commanders align their combat personals in different manners by strategy to launch an attack or defense, depending on their cards. The core challenge of the game is the design and arrangement of the deck.

The clash cards game is launched on the BNB smart chain to ensure lower gas fee and higher scalability that is inherent to the BNB chain.

The game is a decentralized version of the centralized game: Clash royal. Inspired by the latter, the former is designed on the blockchain network to add higher security, immutability, and Play-to-earn mechanics. The blockchain based Clash cards is purely an incentive based game, where your rewards and earnings can be easily converted into crypto assets. Not only, the game mechanics driven by the $CLASH tokens, but the cards in the game are also NFTs, developed on the ERC-721 token standard.

&amp;#x200B;

**Blockchain-based Gaming:**

By utilizing blockchain technology All in-game assets are the player‚Äôs sole and eternal property. Because of the security and transparency that blockchain technology provides for their data, players can have more confidence when playing games. In a decentralized system, players require a certain degree of discretion. Given that blockchain technology is based on a distributed ledger, the decentralized nodes connected to a blockchain network can create permanent storage for the decentralized gaming environments. Because the records are stored on-chain, players can replay previous games for an extended period of time.

**Game Features:**

The community has a decentralized game economy. To distribute authority among different central points, it is transferred from the game team to the players and other community members via a governance model and an invisible hand-driven free market.

**Governance:**

Currently, the Clash cards game offers a multi-layered governance model dispersed on different social mediums where our community can easily interact and express their ideas, and then vote for new implementations.

**Marketplace:**

Moreover, the game also has its off-line marketplace that holds all game inventory for players. As the players progress in the game, different items are unlocked for their perusal. The core purpose of the marketplace is to ensure individuality and freedom of expression, to each player.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gameplay:**

The gameplay revolves around collecting and minting new characters or improving the combat abilities of previous characters. Hence, each player has his own experience of the game.

**Tokenomics:**

The economy of the Clash card game is driven by the $CLASH tokens. The $CLASH tokens are deflationary in nature. The supply of the tokens will be maintained by the project team to ensure price stability.

&amp;#x200B;

**Game structure:**

\*\*Game Engine:\*\*Unity3D is used to develop the game Engine, which is a powerful cross-platform 3D engine that ensures a user-friendly development environment.

\*\*Website:\*\*Created on Node Js, which is best for implementing IoT development projects.

\*\*Feature integration:\*\*It is done through the Moralis server.

\*\*Crypting language:\*\*is C#. It has following underlying features that makes the use of this crypting language more useful:

1. Object-Oriented Language.
2. Automatic Garbage Collection.
3. Cross Platform.
4. Backward Compatibility.
5. Better Integrity and Interoperability.

&amp;#x200B;

**Our Mission:**

Our mission is to create a completely decentralized game that provides all features of DeFi. We have exclusively tried to transform the entire gaming mechanics into a Play-to-earn model; thereby incentivizing all activities in the game, solely for the purpose of entertainment and earning.

We believe that entertainment and earning can be two sides of the same coin, and with the integration of suitable features, one can achieve both.

ethereum,"Ethereum is notorious for being prohibitively slow and costly. At the height of cryptocurrency's most recent hype cycle, something as simple as exchanging one token for another on the blockchain could have cost upwards of $40.  


It's no surprise that L2 protocols have grown in popularity, so there are layer 2 rollups for those who want to keep their transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem, and there's a reason why Metis and other L2 solutions have become so popular.  


Layer 2 rollups have special systems in place to ensure that transactions aren't spoofed or altered before being sent back to Ethereum's main chain, which is pretty cool.  


In what L2 protocol do you believe the most, and what fascinates you about it?  


Did you know that the total value locked in Ethereum's Layer 2 networks has surpassed $5 billion? Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem is undeniably growing.  


Although the Ethereum Merge was the second-most anticipated blockchain update this year, Ethereum supporters have long hoped that Layer 2 growth will help the ecosystem achieve mass adoption by lowering costs and making the network more accessible. While Ethereum mainnet continues to hold the majority of the crypto ecosystem's capital, with just under $32 billion locked up, Layer 2 appears to be catching up quickly.",Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem is undeniably growing,1.0,1,ymrerz,Finley_dz,0,2022-11-05 11:32:25,1667647956,1669824737,2022-11-05,11:32:25

ethereum,"Solidity/React  Question: Using Ethers.js, I'm trying to access a function taking in two variables as parameters using the hook useContractReader. I replicated it from other useContractReader code I have in my project, but it doesn't seem to be working for whatever reason. I assume it has to do with some parsing of the variables I have, but how I do it in other problems, it works fine. 

The React:

    const test = useContractReader(writeContracts, ""YourContract"", ""getTest"", ""1"", ""0""); // Indexing game 1, players 0
    
      function getTestName() {
        if (test == null) {

        } else if (test[0] == null) { // test[0] is the name variable in the struct
          return ""noName"";
        } else {
          return test[0].toString();
        }
      }

ethereum,"While many Ethereum supporters blindly celebrate Meta Instagram‚Äôs move to launch NFTs on Polygon, they have been tricked and ignore that Polygon is no L2 and does not benefit Ethereum in its current form.

Polygon (Matic token) has launched a vampire attack on gullible Ethereum users/ investors by falsely labelling it as an Layer-2 solution and piggy backing off most of its infrastructure and hype associated with L2s. The marketing or better disinformation campaign of Polygon was well done and convinced many Ethereum investors that they are a L2, when the concept was very new. While this move is brilliant it is also malicious‚ÄºÔ∏è

Unlike Arbitrum or Optimism, Polygon is in fact a side chain and therefore as much an L2 to Ethereum as Solana or other L1s like AVAX are (EVM-compatible chains, the latter also tried to position as a ‚Äûspoon‚Äú - a friendly fork). They barely burn a few $100s a day in ETH Gas fees (~6.5 ETH in 24 hours vs. &gt;300 ETH by Uniswap alone).

Polygon PoS claims that the side chain architecture is temporary and that it will transition into a roll-up (e.g. Polygon zkEVM -&gt; ‚ÄûPolygon Hermez‚Äú), but this remains highly questionable and potentially is another false flag. Roll-ups currently accrue little value and once they become big enough, they likely try to create their own L1s, there is no incentive for them to do this move.

There is no such thing as symbiotic relationship between Ethereum and Polygon as of today and in fact they soak up its economic bandwidth/revenue. It is nothing but a big Trojan Horse üê¥ and should be investigated very suspiciously by the Ethereum community going forward‚ÄºÔ∏è",Polygon (Matic) is not beneficial to Ethereum and acts as a parasitic side chain soaking up its economic bandwidth ‚ùå‚ùå,1.0,1,yme67l,Antana18,0,2022-11-04 23:43:06,1667605401,1669824855,2022-11-04,23:43:06
ethereum,"I need an indexed Ethereum transaction dataset for all accounts across Ethereum for my research. For that purpose, I want to run an archive node, along with an indexer (such as Blockscout) that goes through the chain and indexes the transactions into an SQL Database, and I'll be querying that database (mostly using SQL Joins) to get the data I need for different scenarios. I would be building my own PC for running this combo (archive node + indexer). So, what would be an ideal hardware requirement for this build?

I went through a couple of articles on the internet, and they all mostly deal with setups meant for mining or participating in PoW, where the transaction pools with broadcasted transactions must be accessed very fast. In my case, I will not be mining or participating in PoW consensus. I also do not care about getting the live transactions/blocks into my system as soon as they appear. So, I don't think I would need very big SSDs (I might be wrong about this).

Why? is it a mismatch of liquidity providers, i see that large amounts of eth have been deposited to these dex, while stablecoin tvl appears to have been dwindling.

\*OR\* is it just a harbinger of the fact that large eth sellers are selling on smaller dexes and keeping the price artificially high on the large exchanges?

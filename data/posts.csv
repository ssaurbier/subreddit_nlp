bitcoin,from brett harrison's latest tweet an hour ago spilling the beans many have asked questions about my time at ftx us and why i left when i did as i indicated earlier this week i m happy to begin sharing my experiences and perspective publicly i worked at ftx us for seveeen mohs when my resignation s made public those unfamiliar with my plans were surprised and some questid whether i d been fired it seemed as though i d left a dream job abruptly after a very short tenure the truth s that ftx us hadn t felt to me the dream job it appeared to the industry and media for some time and my departure s not abrupt my relationship with sam bankman fried and his deputies had reached a poi of total deterioration after mohs of disputes over manageme practices at ftx and as a group of my friends meors and investors knew then i d felt such a strong conviction to found my own company that it sn t worth keeping a dream job no matter the prestige or upside no matter the risk it posed to my reputation in departing so early sam asked me to join ftx us casually over text in late march he s my former colleague at jane street and i had fond memories of his presence there we d barely stayed in touch over the years but i d occasionally read news about ftx s growth i s happy to hear from him and ierested to learn more about how things were going at ftx i d n sam to be a conscieious junior trader at jane street who d e well in the programming for traders course i taught there in which he d been my stude in manager meetings about sam s performance the senior traders on his desk indicated he had promise beyond that he seemed a sensitive and iellectually curious person who cared about animals and that endeared him to me my negotiations to join ftx us moved quickly a welcome corast to the mohs they d taken for every move i d made in traditional finance i d built softre for jane street s crypto desk in but hadn t worked on crypto since i s excited to dive back in my first few mohs at ftx us were wonderful i worked largely independely of sam to grow a us based team and foster a professional environme prepared for regulated businesses i made plans with the ledgerx team built out legal compliance and operations departmes with first in class lateral hires and began setting up and building a us regulated retail stock brokerage ftx us s spot exchange s growing in market share the team s dedicated and productive customer feedback s positive i s excited about the future but from the start i noticed that while sam s rarely engaged on the us business decisions impacting the us would come without rning from the bahamas six mohs io my time at the company pronounced cracks began to form in my own relationship with sam around then i began advocating strongly for establishing separation and independence for the executive legal and developer teams of ftx us and sam disagreed i saw in that early conflict his total insecurity and iransigence when his decisions were questid his spitefulness and the volatility of his temperame i realized he sn t who i remembered i sn t sure what accoued for the dramatic change i saw in sam many of us i have family and friends who live with addiction and meal health problems and i ve seen how these problems often manifest without much rning in early adulthood i thought that might be a coributing factor and initially felt sympathetic but i didn t sam well enough personally or have any real time to reflect on the question i s in a business relationship with him and he s making a number of decisions about running a business that i disagreed with there s tremendous pressure not to disagree with sam but i did so anyy at that time and for all of my time at ftx us his influence over the media ftx s partners the veure capital industry and the traditional finance industry s pervasive and unyielding standing up to an insecure prideful manager is hard under any circumstance but it s nearly impossible when every day every major voice of culture and commerce deafens you with a narrative that implies if you disagree with your manager you clearly must be wrong i sn t the only at ftx us who disagreed with sam and members of his inner circle ftx us s staffed with experienced professionals from us finance firms law firms and regulated exchanges our collective experience and professional acumen were frequely treated as though they were irreleva and valueless it s extremely frustrating for all of us over the ensuing mohs i further argued for enacting a sensible hiring policy for staffing ftx us with a c suite of experienced officers for transpare communication between sam and ftx us leadership for gary ng s and nishad singh s softre developme responsibilities to be formally ideified and shared across a larger group for the delegation of managerial responsibility and corols beyond sam and bahamas based executives and other importa matters sam s uncomfortable with conflict he responded at times with dysregulated hostility at times with gaslighting and manipulation but ultimately chose to isolate me from communication on key decision making it felt terrible i sought out information about decisions that had been made behind my back desperate but trying hard not to show it in early april my eleveh moh i made last try i made a written formal complai about what i saw to be the largest organizational problems inhibiting ftx s future success i wrote that i would resign if the problems weren t addressed in response i s threatened on sam s behalf that i would be fired and that sam would destroy my professional reputation i s instructed to formally retract what i d written and to deliver an apology to sam that had been drafted for me that eve solidified my decision to leave i knew an abrupt departure would be harmful to the company and my ftx us reports and i ed to best position the company for future success after i left so i gradually wound down finished building and releasing the us stock brokerage and saw ftx us employees through their mid year reviews and with that i shifted my focus to the future and to my own company the information that is now in the public record from indictmes complais guilty pleas or otherwise show facts that even now after mohs are difficult for me to assimilate io reality i raised concerns at the company believing that the manageme and organizational issues i saw were typical of growing start ups and that my role as an experienced financial services executive s to correct them and unlock the next stage of the company s growth i never could have guessed that underlying these kinds of issues which i d seen at other more mature firms in my career and believed not to be fatal to business success s multi billion dollar fraud it s clear from what has been made public that the scheme s held closely by sam and his inner circle at ftx com and alameda which i s not a part of nor were other executives at ftx us i understand now why they carefully concealed their criminal activity from us we have extensive professional networks our own lines of communication with us regulators and our own authority to speak to us media if any of us had suspected let al learned the truth we would have reported them immediately over my seveeen mohs at ftx us my colleagues and i dedicated everything to serving the needs of our customers and growing real businesses we believed offered consumers a y to more equitably access financial services that are ceral to their lives ancie forms of greed and dishsty destroy trust and corrupt progress the scale of this particular instance of this lesson is difficult to comprehend but far from exceptional in the twelve years of my professional experience in finance it s a strange dissonance after i left ftx us and up uil november nearly every conversation i had with a veure capitalist about my new company eveually came around to the same kind of question is ftx investing is sam okay with you doing this do you mind if we confirm with him after that many conversations eveually came around to the same kind of apology we you weren t involved in what sam and others did but we can t take on the pr risk of associating ourselves with ftx no matter how capable you are or compelling your idea is the last few mohs have provided me with a valuable character study of the industry some treated me an eirely differe person overnight some immediately offered sympathy and support it will be a difficult experience to forget it will also be difficult to forget the frenzied and baseless accusations leveled against me on social media for emple that my resignation could only mean i had ledge of a criminal scheme even though there s no evidence of that and available information shows the scheme s run by a small number of people in another coury and began years before i joined ftx us or that i m seeking a plea deal even though i haven t been accd of wrongdoing and am not a target in any investigation or that while at ftx us i colluded with citadel to manipulate tokenized stock prices yes people are actually saying this i m grateful from the bottom of my heart to those who showed me unvering trust and support through the turbulence of the last two mohs they helped me cut through the noise and remain focd on the future even as they themselves had been harmed by the tragedy of ftx s collapse i credit them along with my family with getting me through the most devastating and destabilizing eve of my professional life i m extremely honored to have them as partners the path ahead

bitcoin,i have heard this a lot about btc btc is a zero sum game which to me implies my can't be made by owning btc my ieion in writing this is not to discuss peoples motives for why they own btc and whether they are right or wrong this zero sum nonsense keeps ringing in my ear is btc really a zero sum game well yes in my opinion if we are discussing transactions in terms of btc its actually a slight net loss every transaction requires some sort of network fee but on the other had in terms of dollars it really depends if you assume the ierest in btc remains consta from this mome of time on then holding btc inherely increases in dollar value overtime if you assume no increase or decrease in btc then you're comparing a finite number with fiat which the fed for emple pris more and more of overtime by this train of thought your x amou of btc last year will be worth some amou more in fiat this year so in terms of dollars its ly a net gain i 't claim to be a financial wizard in fact i'm fine if this is completely idiotic but the argume of measuring something that that doesn't increase with something that does increase pois to btc being a net gain a store of value if nothing else meaning btc gains no further adoption i 't see how it doesn't serve the purpose of holding my prier accouable ok ok but there could be more crypto currencies i get this argume too technically the number of crypto currencies could approach infinity making btc a net loss if ierest s distributed amongst those other currencies that's fine but i also 't see that as a threat i there is inhere dominance in being the original i can't really articulate that thought much further thoughts this is caveman math i get it just wondering what else would be ieresting to consider ,btc is a zero sum game,1.0,1,10a8t5i,astroportal_,0,2023-01-12 19:50:53,1673553065,1673553066,2023-01-12,19:50:53

bitcoin,bitcoin represes differe things for every but in such a polarized world i find refreshing that people can stand side by side for something that they believe even though their reason to believe it is differe some people here for having the option to keep their savings out of the hand of any institution some just believe the number will rise some actually this will free people and provide every a better future a good thing about bitcoin that it aligns inceives and since the inceives are all aligned even if some here for the altruistic reasons or selfish reasons it doesn t really matter and that s a good thing and i feel hope real hope for the future maybe for the first time of my life that we can still unite and build something together slowly but surely i have difficult time to understand why people care about it so much and feel the need to talk badly about it if they believe it will go to zero dollars i t understand the hate or frustration behind it as a couer argume can say the bitcoiners show a similar attitude tords shitcoins but i the real frustration there is not related to the pricing of other coins the frustration is there beca bitcoin represeed and understood by lots of people under the umbrella of cryptocurrencies and the scammers using their fabricated and corolled currencies is damaging to what bitcoin is trying to achieve this is a long road and i myself still very new to this ecosystem and when you about it and everything started from people and now couries discussing it some accepting some refusing energy companies starting mining it feels difficult for me to go back to zero but as i said at the beginning apart from the price perspective it is really refreshing for me to be able to believe in something and do something for it it s something that i can feel lacking for my generation so i m happy to be be here and be a part of this journey ,my personal thoughts and feelings about bitcoin being ideology ,1.0,1,109ia51,lordkorhag,0,2023-01-11 22:37:35,1673476668,1673476669,2023-01-11,22:37:35

bitcoin,hi all i'm a big fan of bitcoin having read the wp years ago when the project s still in its infancy and finally became an investor when the bubble s just getting kicked off i've been an evangelist for it since then as i believe it will radically change the world in positive ys if you ask my friends they will let you that i can't shut up about it since about i've been working on a side project for a baseball site titled scout the statline if you're a fan of faasy baseball dynasty style in particular or card collecting or just baseball and numbers i'd love if you checked us out and gave us your thoughts on what we're doing our goal is to data modeling to highlight the minor and major leagues' most ieresting players and prospects what makes us unique is that everything is data based and updated on a daily basis to bring insta info and insights to our rs you're probably ing what does baseball have to do with bitcoin well not much directly at least but since these two things are passions of mine i'm trying to iegrate them we offer a subscription for access to premium coe and accept bitcoin as payme however what i'm looking for are thoughts or ideas on how we can set up subscriptions using bitcoin lightning would be preferred we would need to gather a rs email address at the very least to provide them with access i presume that i'd need to a paymes platform to do it right but to gather thoughts can any of you share thoughts or insights on the best y i can accomplish this thanks ross,bitcoin amp baseball content,1.0,1,108j939,rossrjensen,0,2023-01-10 19:59:16,1673380772,1673380773,2023-01-10,19:59:16

bitcoin,there is a lot of fear around setting up a multi sig whether it's the setup itself or the fear of restoring the from scratch it can be iimidating to move from single sig io the wonderful world of multi sig but it's worth it as your stack grows to be a more and more substaial part of your wealth so will the fear of losing your stack via a single poi of failure with single sig i that there are ys to create redundancy and security with single sig e g sd card backups multiple seedphrase locations passphrases but i would argue that if you are willing to create redundancy and extra security with single sig you already have the motivation and ly the technical expertise to move to multi sig so eer multi vendor multi sig sparrow first why multi sig in general there are two major compelling reasons for multi sig redundancy from single key loss or theft this is obvious plausible deniability in a wrench attack this second s the main that made me move to multi sig in the ever increasing world of data leaks and kyc it has become almost impossible to stay incognito as a bitcoiner having multi sig makes the effort to physically coerce you so much more difficult if an attacker has to transport you to another location especially if it's a public place a bank security deposit box and as multi sig becomes the norm then physically coercive attacks become less tempting as a whole in the space second sparrow makes multi sig setup a breeze to start it's open source the ui is so much more r friendly than electrum and it automatically prompts super importa steps downloading the backup script to restore the it has been formatted to work seamlessly with almost all the major hardre s finally why multi vendor multi sig why not just coldcards in a of setup or trezors in a of setup by creating a setup where no vendor has a quorum of keys e g coldcards bitboxes trezor you remove that tiny little worry that of the companies could be malicious and has somehow gotten your keys either via a usb connection or incomplete eropy at key generation or that you've been the target of a supply chain attack technically you should even be able to trust closed source hardre s e g ledger in a setup this still recommending open source though as a matter of principle in the bitcoin space however if you go down this route these are the absolute imperatives to setting up a multi sig you must backup your and store a copy of all the xpubs preferably in both electronic and physical form if you need to restore your from scratch you will need the xpubs of all the keys not just a quorum this is by far the biggest pitfall of multi sig luckily sparrow prompts you to create this backup at the time of creation at least preferably all of your hardre s needs to be able to verify the multi sig including the xpubs of all signers on the device i won't go io too much detail but malre could insert additional cosigners at the time of creation so you need an external validation of the setup hardre s that i can do this from personal experience are bitbox coldcard and foundation passport i'm sure there are others but i can't speak to those this applies to both single and multi sig but you should alys verify send and receive addresses on the hardre device itself i will plug for foundation passport on this they make receive address verification via qr code very streamlined there's a lot more to the actual of multisig including using psbts with certain hardre s but these actually 't differ from single sig other than having to do it multiple times rather than just once per transaction i could go on and on about other aspects of vs of storage location of keys seedless setups but this post is getting long if you are ierested in seeing sparrow in action with multi sig here's a great video that finally prompted me to go with sparrow s multisig starts at ,multi vendor multi sig sparrow wallet one of if not the best self sovereign solutions to self custody,1.0,1,106kulg,realistic-jelly8133,0,2023-01-08 14:43:25,1673189022,1673189022,2023-01-08,14:43:25

bitcoin,basically there is a very large number of globally distributed nodes banks that transact with each other and that keeps a vee of their own ledger and they settle it every day or every couple of days to reconcile all the amous yes not every bank has every transaction or every accou balance but only those of their customers but still its distributed deceralized chained though not cryptographically so the only difference to btc is that btc has ledger with everything it is cryptographically verifiable so it's trust less and its faster ok arguably the banks are actually the layer and clearing hos of the swift system are the layer which is more ceralised than the banking system assuming the above is true then maybe a better y to explain btc is not by explaining the tech and blockchain etc but rather by saying something btc is an alternative to the swift system and its clearing hos that is deceralized open and not corolled by any eity it is faster and fully transpare and if we say that then the question comes do the powers that be actually competition in this manner not that they can stop it per se but they can outlaw it just files haring cannot be stopped but be outlawed or made very inconvenie just trying to of the appropriate analogy that btc is better than ,isn't the global banking system basically a blockchain as well ,1.0,1,103wh8c,anthonyhsiao,0,2023-01-05 11:14:12,1672917267,1672917268,2023-01-05,11:14:12

bitcoin,id to offer a few charts i've been working on for an open discussion all opinions thoughs and suggestions are welcome a few notes to begin orange vertical line is a halving date green line is top forecast for next cycle the date chosen is the average time to top from the previous halvings line of best fit is expial looks linear on a log base graph chart y axis is log scale base first chart halvings top estimate k second chart halvings top estimate k third chart previous low to curre low top estimate k discussion it's ieresting to see the lower the timeframe that the chart looks back the lower the forecast high of the next cycle is i believe the reason is due to the diminishing blow off tops we are seeing from cycle to cycle i have a theory for that bitcoin network access to new funds the first cycle bitcoin gained access to a new pool of funds first movers the second cycle bitcoin also gained access to a new pool of funds through a rise in exchanges providing easy access the third cycle bitcoin gained access to new funds through a large increase in media coverage the fourth cycle curre cycle bitcoin didn't gain access funds that would make as significa a step change to the price as it had in previous cycles as such the lack of blow off top in the curre cycle effects the best fit price forecast more significaly when the time period emined is lower so where should the top estimate fall with such a wide range showing in the charts between k and k with no significa increase in access to new funds i'm looking at k as a top if several larger nations start to adpot btc as legal tender i'm looking at k as a top if several larger nations and institutions gain access through clear and favorable regulation then i'm looking at k as a top i believe on a log scale these eves have a similar impact to the previously discussed eves in past cycles such as first movers rise in exchanges and increase in media converage we are currely at k suggesting from the curre value we see a increase to the top of the next cycle the better question i is what should an exit strategy look well we currely have days uil the next halving and days uil the estimated top based on previous cycles cycle s days from halving to top cycle s days from halving to top with years to top an exit strategy is a tough question to consider especially considering the swings in mtary policy over the last years for now i'm looking purely at the time to top and its correlation with the halving the halving eve inherrely forms a supply demand crunch causing uprd pressure on the price significa uprd prices alys lead to fomo and hence an overshoot on true valve as we have seen in every cycle the time duration of this overshoot has alys been roughly the same in the btc space again days in the past cycles if there is thing i am willing to rely on it is that human nature repeats itself this date for those curious is th of october what would have me re evaluate the estimated top date is if of the aformeid eves large nations adopting btc and institutional access occurs mohs after the halving in which case i we could see the top date pushed further out due to a late boom in access to new funds in this case i would start to look at the k to form the basis of my exit strategy rather than a set date let us your thoughts as a final though provoker we often see an estimate cap put on btc due to its similarity to gold as a store of value digital gold the valuation of the gold market is roughly t however is estimated to be ish physical to paper ratio why do we not see this considered when corrilating it in a store of value sense to btc not financial advice ,btc price forecast amp discussion,1.0,1,102nhng,digital_oceans,0,2023-01-03 23:42:33,1672789365,1672789365,2023-01-03,23:42:33

bitcoin,if you consider the following from the manifesto the distinguishing feature of communism is not the abolition of property generally but the abolition of bourgeois property but modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products that is based on class aagonisms on the exploitation of the many by the few in this sense the theory of the communists may be summed up in the single seence abolition of private property we communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man s own labour which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom activity and independence hard won self acquired self earned property do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasa a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form there is no need to abolish that the developme of industry has to a great exte already destroyed it and is still destroying it daily fascinating that the discovery of bitcoin has single handedly destroyed the eire theory of the communism as for the first time in human history private property can be graed to any in the world as a true bearer asset and those rights will be upheld by the network regardless of your class background real world influence the hard work puts io accumulating wealth to provide for and protect his family can be exchanged for a private property which is hst sound ethical grounded in physics and mathematics most people on this planet cannot access banking and that is the biggest divider of wealthy inequality beca my is half of everything we do the simplicity of code has removed the marginalisation of the majority of people on this planet by establishing the same property rights for a multi billionaire in america and a poor farmer in nigeria while secured via true free market capitalism with the mining industry poor communities in rural areas are now able to tap io locked up natural resources that would ve otherwise g to ste by expelling io the atmosphere and mtise the energy by mining bitcoin by implemeing a system that respects true iegrity soundness and hsty satoshi nakamoto has quite literally destroyed the main tena of the communist ideology by providing property rights to billion people without exploiting a single being ,reading the communist manifesto through bitcoin lens is fascinating,1.0,1,100x9nv,itsnotthatdeepbrah,0,2023-01-01 23:47:07,1672616847,1672616847,2023-01-01,23:47:07

bitcoin,in which i s speculating on btc s usd price to exceed k in and eveually become the global reserve currency within years let get io it human beings have a hard time understanding expial growth for a number of reasons of the main reasons is that our brains are wired to in linear terms we are d to things growing or changing at a steady rate and expial growth does not follow this pattern expial growth is characterized by a rapid increase in which the rate of increase itself increases this means that the growth becomes faster and faster over time a common emple of expial growth is the concept of compound ierest if you invest a certain amou of my at a certain rate of ierest the amou of my you earn will increase over time however the rate of increase will also increase so the longer you leave the my invested the more it will grow this can be hard for people to wrap their heads around beca it goes against our natural instincts we are d to ing about things in terms of how much they increase by a certain amou over a certain period of time expial growth on the other hand increases by a certain perceage over a certain period of time which means that the rate of increase itself increases another reason why humans have a hard time understanding expial growth is that it is difficult to visualize when we about growth we tend to about it in terms of physical objects or quaities that we can see and touch however expial growth is not something that we can easily observe in the physical world it is a mathematical concept that is difficult to visualize which makes it harder for us to understand a further reason why expial growth can be hard to understand is that it is often coueriuitive for emple if you start with a small number and double it repeatedly the resulting numbers may not seem very significa at first however if you keep doubling the number it will eveually become much larger than you might have expected this is beca each time you double the number you are adding a much larger amou than you did the time before finally humans have a hard time understanding expial growth beca it can lead to seemingly impossible or unbelievable outcomes for emple if a virus were to double in size every day it would seem impossible that it could take over the world in just a few short weeks however this is ectly what can happen with expial growth it may start off small but it can quickly become much larger than any could have predicted if you are still with me and are having a hard time connecting the concept of expial growth to bitcoin let me explain bitcoin a deceralized digital currency has seen expial growth since its creation in of the main reasons for this is that bitcoin has a limited supply there will only ever be million bitcoins in existence and as more and more people become are of and ierested in bitcoin the demand for it increases this limited supply combined with increasing demand has led to the price of bitcoin experiencing expial growth over time however this expial growth has also made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin beca of its non linear growth it is difficult to traditional financial models to forecast the price of bitcoin this has led to a great deal of speculation and uncertaiy surrounding the future of the currency another factor coributing to the difficulty in understanding the expial growth of bitcoin is the fact that it is a relatively new and highly complex technology the of blockchain a deceralized ledger that records all bitcoin transactions adds an additional layer of complexity to the currency this complexity can make it difficult for people to fully understand how bitcoin works and how it is valued the expial growth of bitcoin has been driven by a combination of limited supply increasing demand and the complexity of the technology behind it this growth has made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin but has also attracted a great deal of ierest due to the poteial for significa returns on investme in conclusion humans have a hard time understanding expial growth beca it goes against our natural linear ing is difficult to visualize is often coueriuitive and can lead to seemingly impossible outcomes it is importa for people to understand this concept however beca it can have significa implications in many differe areas including economics population growth and the spread of diseases tldr expial growth is difficult for people to conceptualize beca it goes against our natural linear ing is often coueriuitive and can lead to seemingly impossible outcomes btc has already experienced expial growth multiple times and is still in its infancy dca and hodl ,exponential growth understanding and the lack there of as it relates to btc ,1.0,1,100nz10,neckcrafty5641,0,2023-01-01 17:07:54,1672592892,1672592893,2023-01-01,17:07:54

bitcoin,i should preface this post by letting folks that i am not a coder that said however my concerns are that when newer versions of bitcoin core comes out you see bug fixes etc from the previous version but also there are occasionally changes to the rules of consensus this esseially means that if you upgrade to the latest version you effectively vote for that new rules of consensus from your version of what previously you voted bitcoin s imo there should be a differene approach here when bugs are found why not update the older versions as well without touching the rules of consensus in said older versions you could still have the original versions available for reference however this approach would keep the bitcoin network safer and more robust while coinuing to allow the individual node operators to decide what version of bitcoin is the true bitcoin which is the whole poi aka deceralization for emple i'm not a fan of taro or taproot in general for that matter in the bitcoin protocol so i 't run bitcoin core beyond a certain version unfortunately these versions have apparely since had bugs reported and remedied by later versions that said my concern there is that eveually my versions may have fatal bugs uncovered and the only y to keep bitcoin running is to upgrade to something that i would consider to be true bitcoin any thoughts on this would be appreciated in the mean time i'll coinue to dca and take immediate possession of my private keys to ppkh addresses only which i generate offline as to forrd this peaceful moveme ,the bitcoin node rules of consensus make bitcoin well bitcoin however ,1.0,1,zxuezy,bitcoincansaveusall,0,2022-12-29 03:30:46,1672284665,1672284665,2022-12-29,03:30:46

bitcoin,bitcoin is a deceralized cryptocurrency that s a peer to peer network to facilitate transactions and validate them through a process called mining it s designed to be a deceralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies which are corolled by ceral banks and governmes however over the years there have been concerns about the increasing ceralization of the bitcoin network here are a few reasons why some people believe that bitcoin is becoming more ceralized conceration of mining power a small number of mining pools which are groups of miners that combine their computing power to increase their chances of finding a block have a significa proportion of the total mining power on the network this conceration of mining power could poteially allow these pools to manipulate the network and make it more difficult for smaller miners to compete influence of large exchanges a small number of large exchanges such as coinbase and binance dominate the market for buying and selling bitcoin these exchanges have significa corol over the price of bitcoin and can poteially manipulate the market to their advaage dependence on a few key players some key infrastructure providers such as bitmain and blockstream have a significa influence on the direction of the bitcoin network these companies corol importa aspects of the network such as the developme of the protocol and the operation of key infrastructure which could give them disproportionate power over the network limited number of nodes while the bitcoin network has a large number of nodes a significa proportion of these nodes are run by a small number of organizations this could make it easier for these organizations to coordinate and poteially exert corol over the network overall while bitcoin s designed to be a deceralized cryptocurrency there are concerns that it is becoming more ceralized as the network has grown this ceralization could poteially undermine the deceralized nature of the network and lead to more ceralized corol over the network ,bitcoin being centralised,1.0,1,zxd5n4,lilcutie_677,0,2022-12-28 15:59:27,1672243186,1672243187,2022-12-28,15:59:27

bitcoin,good morning i've been in bitcoin for less than two years so i just 't enough to discuss some topics but i ed to make a stateme about how privacy is key to bitcoin success bitcoin is mea to be a form of electronic cash se between peers its main goal is to gra people a y of exiting the fiat system at least partially and in order to do so bitcoin needs to be aifragile but bitcoiners need to be that too ca there is no bitcoin without bitcoiners you can make sure nobody is taking your btc ay by taking your coins io self custody and that's true but many people who have been on the space for much longer assure that having your keys its already enough i strongly disagree with that you need privacy to be aifragile if your coins are kycd you are an easy target for anybody with enough ledge to trace you governme included many nobody is going to take the time to trace you in that y well i they will as soon as you do something they find disturbing enough and bitcoin success is something they will find so very disturbing i can't express properly how importa a good privacy is for a bitcoiner and i am so worried that the main voices in the space usually just 't care about it ca you only need privacy if you are doing something wrong first of all that's a lie and secondly well who says what's wrong the only y they won't go against you at some poi is if they 't who to go against ,privacy in bitcoin is more important that you think,1.0,2,zwfr3u,wilfow,0,2022-12-27 13:33:23,1672148018,1672148019,2022-12-27,13:33:23

bitcoin,cryptocurrencies bitcoin have the poteial to revolutionize the financial systems for those who really need it reason for this is that many people in these couries do not trust their governmes to corol their financial systems responsibly in many couries the level of corruption is high and resources are often times mismanaged cryptocurrencies offer an alternative y to store and transfer value beca of this block chains bitcoin are deceralized and not corolled by any single eity thus providing a level of security and transparency that is often lacking additionally cryptocurrencies can increase financial inclusion in developing couries many people in these couries do not have access to traditional banking services either beca they are too expensive or beca they are difficult to get cryptocurrencies offer a y for these individuals to participate in the global economy even if they 't have a bank accou finally the of cryptocurrencies can also help to reduce the risk of fraud and other financial crimes in developing couries beca all transactions are recorded on a public ledger it is much harder for fraudule activity to go undetected overall the future of cryptocurrencies in developing couries will be insane they offer a y for people to store and transfer value in a secure and transpare y all while increasing financial inclusion ,bitcoin is good for those who have the least,1.0,1,zs7238,godking99,0,2022-12-22 00:44:55,1671669912,1671669912,2022-12-22,00:44:55

bitcoin, the increasing hash rate of the bitcoin network the hash rate is a measure of the processing power of the bitcoin network and it has been steadily increasing over time this is an importa factor beca it helps to secure the network and makes it more resista to attacks the halving eve the halving is a programmed reduction in the rate at which new bitcoins are generated which occurs approximately every four years this eve is significa beca it reduces the supply of new bitcoins which can lead to an increase in demand and in turn a higher price rapid adoption rate the adoption rate of bitcoin is often cited as being faster than the adoption rate of the iernet in its early days this suggests that more and more people and businesses are starting to recognize the poteial of bitcoin as a means of payme and store of value increasing mainstream acceptance bitcoin is becoming increasingly mainstream with more businesses accepting it as a payme method and more r friendly platforms and products becoming available poteial to replace traditional global currencies there is a growing belief that bitcoin has the poteial to replace traditional global currencies in the next decade due to a ning faith in elite ceralized banks and a lack of governme accouability bitcoin offers certain advaages over traditional currencies such as its deceralized nature which makes it resista to inflation and manipulation by governmes or financial institutions overall these factors suggest that bitcoin has the poteial to coinue to rise in value in the coming years while it is difficult to predict the ect trajectory of any asset the increasing hash rate halving eve rapid adoption rate increasing mainstream acceptance and the poteial for bitcoin to replace traditional global currencies all coribute to its poteial value in ,there are several key factors that suggest that bitcoin is likely to be valued at over in and could become the global reserve currency in less than years ,1.0,1,zs4joq,neckcrafty5641,0,2022-12-21 23:06:06,1671663984,1671663984,2022-12-21,23:06:06

bitcoin,tldr let's have a discussion regarding the trend in price volatility not price for btc and re its heading i would to see some good analysis on this btc has been the best performing asset in modern history but this has come with volatility no other this volatility while it lasts is very much a once in a lifetime opportunity for those who can buy and hold over the long term even if they 't time the market particularly well but better if they do that said it's my understanding that volatility is generally decreasing year by year while this is generally regarded as a good thing for increasing the adoption rate of btc it also means that the oportunity preseed by said volatility will lesson over time we see a lot of price projections during the bull runs at least but i 't see many volatility projections yesterday i s playing around with the simple annual perceage growths on chart and adding a trend line i'm not going to post it here beca i didn't keep the results and i wouldn't consider my method to be particularly savey it s all very rudimeary and not anything i would hang any credibility on i simply observed that yes volatility is decreasing and therefore the expected rate of annual growth would also likley decrease going forrd this doesn't mean that btc isn't still an amazing investme oportunity in addition to all its other societal benifits mtary freedom store of value etc but it does mean our growth expectations shouldn't be as high as we observed in the last three halving cycles i say expectations beca there are alys external factors disasters rs new tech that can affect short term price in iether direction i guess what saying is it would be ieresting to see more compete analysis regarding the volatility trend and re its heading ,discussion projecting the reduction of price volatility,1.0,1,zqux25,jarviez,0,2022-12-20 17:56:29,1671559007,1671559007,2022-12-20,17:56:29

bitcoin,here's how it would work they pri a couple billion dollars they buy a million hardre s each buys a few hundred thousand sats then an army of bureaucrats sends the sats back and forth to each others' s over and over again producing far more than transactions per second and that's all those bureaucrats do all day it's their job and they could then afford to attach super uber crazy high fees to each transaction say worth of sats per transaction esseially crowding out any who s to the bitcoin network to send their own transactions it would drive the fees sky high through the roof which would ca most ordinary people to be turned off from using bitcoin if they kept this up for a few years it would stifle the network and no would to it beca you'd have to compete with those high fees which are artificially driven up by governmeal action it really seems to me that this could be the most effective y for the governme to attack bitcoin with just a couple billion which is a drop in the bucket for the us govt hell powell could crank that out in a keystroke they could make every fee for an eire year be more ly far higher seriously transactions second about million year so for a little over a billion they could make the fees be at least on each transaction making it prohibitively expensive to the network for any small transactions what are your guys' thoughts on this ,what if the us federal government attacked bitcoin with a throughput attack as in clog up all the transaction throughput with a bunch of dummy transactions in order to slow down the network and thus discourage it's usage ,1.0,1,zqtab5,ronpaulwasr1ght,0,2022-12-20 16:50:51,1671555070,1671555070,2022-12-20,16:50:51

bitcoin,i'm trying to understand some things about bitcoin and i've been searching for days tching videos reading articles n of them have explained it to my absolute understanding it's frustrating question transaction inputs where ectly do the inputs come from i lear they are utxo's unspe transaction outputs from previous transactions which transactions and to whom does every payme that comes to me generate a new utxo so for emple if people have recely se me btc to a single address i own do i have separate utxo's to spend as inputs for my next transaction that s my reasoning and it seemed to be making sense uil i came across info that said the inputs can come from differe addresses huh okay looks they have a poi though beca when i check the block explorer for transactions i actually see distinct addresses as inputs and outputs it should mean that every address can rather only have utxo at a time right and multiple utxo's should definitely come from differe addresses but if multiple addresses are d as inputs shouldn't all of them be owned by the sender beca only the sender should authorise a transaction now if that's the case how is that e beca with the s i've d trust and binance i 't see an option to select multiple addresses i own and combine their value when i'm sending btc so what's happening can multiple inputs only be achieved using low level coding or something when i search for how to send bitcoin from multiple addresses or similar i 't find anything that answers my question it's as if that's not possible i'm just not getting it for the outputs i understand but the inputs haven't really been explained to me can some who understands this from a to z spell it out for me without leaving anything out i'd be really grateful question block confirmations and reversibility many sources say that transactions that have or more confirmations can be considered irreversible okay logically that should mean that with less than confirmations the transaction can be reversed now what i about block confirmations is that it's the number of blocks that have been added to the blockchain after the that coains the transaction in question so that means even with or two confirmations the block is actually on the public blockchain right so if the transaction can be reversed how is that e will it be pulled down from the blockchain funny question what would happen to the blocks after it meanwhile if you search for can bitcoin transactions be reversed all the answers you get are no so what's really the poi here ,i have big questions about bitcoin transactions ,1.0,1,zql2gk,xor_dinary,0,2022-12-20 10:31:16,1671532292,1671532292,2022-12-20,10:31:16

bitcoin,i've been seeing a lot of new people that seem to have no grasp on the basics of economics regarding currency what gives it value etc i posted this as a comme in another thread that didn't get much atteion so i thought i would post it again as its own post to help those who are new to bitcoin or 't have much understanding of the fundameal value proposition of bitcoin as a currency first you need to ask yourself why the dollar has any value learn a bit about the history of my the first currencies were commodity my they derived their value from their irinsic but they were cumbersome to so we inveed paper my that s backed by commodities such as gold which could be exchanged for it and gave it value in the us fed stopped allowing dollars to be exchanged for gold making our my fiat my with no backing fiat means command it is created out of nothing by an issuing authority now about what the federal reserve has been doing and the effects their actions have had on the economy they previously lowered ierest rates to ierest rates are the cost of obtaining my my that has no cost to obtain has no value and an unlimited supply the my supply has been increased by more than over the last years and much more than that over the previous ceury you can view the fed's own data here the value of the dollar over the long term is trending tord zero along with every other fiat currency look at this chart and see how much value it has lost over time s most my is already digital it's just a database in your bank's servers that has names associated with amous less than of the my supply exists as cash it would be impossible for every to convert their electronic deposits io cash banks actually create extra my in the my supply when they make loans reserve requiremes were suspended in the covid era meaning banks could create unlimited amous of loans with no reserves at all this is stuff you would all learn in an iro economics class but it's very fundameal to understanding why any currency has value or loses its value my derives its value from being something that is fungible durable divisible portable and limited in supply the more of these properties it has the better it is as my it must serve as a unit of accou a medium of exchange and a store of value the better it is at these things the better it is as my bitcoin has all of these qualities making it ful as my it's much more divisible than the dollar much more portable and more limited in supply so far the bitcoin network has never had a major outage or hack it is free and open source with out a ceral authority so far its value has only g up over the long term despite its high volatility in the short term limited supply is esseial a currency's poteial as a long term store of value many couries have hyperinflated their currencies with disastrous results right now around the world many couries are experiencing extremely high amous of inflation learn about what has happened in argeina venezuela zimbabwe hungary and many more couries due to hyperinflation it's a crisis around the world almost all the world's couries fiat currency now many people in these couries face authoritarian governmes or do not have access to a stable currency bitcoin has obvious fulness to these people as well as any else who s an alternative to fiat my that will do nothing but lose value over time ,the basic economics of why bitcoin has value,1.0,1,zq0gf4,future-iterations,0,2022-12-19 19:07:06,1671476842,1671476842,2022-12-19,19:07:06

bitcoin,due to bitcoin's hard cap if bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency and all things become naturally priced in bitcoin this would mean that each bitcoin and each sat will become more and more valuable as the economy grows i assuming the economy will grow indefinitely is not as trivial as i'm making it sound but let's just assume it'll be the case for this thought experime so basically things will cost less and less bitcoin and we will reach a poi when a single gummy bear will be worth less than sat at this poi we'll need a smaller unit in order to pay for everyday stuff even a cup of coffee will be worth less than sat eveually hell you could say that about almost anything if you go far enough in the future assuming the human race survives till the universe ends so my questions are what's the code change needed to make this a reality is it just changing some value on a line of code in github and then of course the majority of the nodes accepting the change if so where is that line why sn't bitcoin made infinitely divisible in the first place are there some technical issues that would arise if this s the case what's the reasoning behind choosing million per bitcoin as the lower limit and not million or billion ,assuming bitcoin will need a smaller unit than sats eventually how does that look from a technical point of view ,1.0,1,zp1ow0,21_mil_btc,0,2022-12-18 15:58:44,1671379137,1671379137,2022-12-18,15:58:44

bitcoin,ok basic question here to my ledge btc requires miners to validate transactions proof of work and mining requires an expenditure of energy which costs generally some kind of fiat currency as bitcoin halves and becomes harder to mine the relative profit margin approaches the cost of mining further fluctuations in the value of btc poteially means putting miners underter versus the cost of mining electricity hardre what happens when the cost of mining outstrips the profit of btc say the cost of mining btc is btcs in the relative fiat currency if miners drop out and transactions cannot be validated the relative exchange value of btc is thus since no exchange can take place is there something i'm missing here this seems a weakness inhere to pow crypto especially btc which has a growing cost to mine based upon the halving aspect of the hash mining further i cannot of a real world couerpart since exchanging gold isn't incumbe on any mining it in fact as gold miners drop out the cost of gold would increase due to the effect of scarcity i'm sure i'm missing something since this seems an obvious real threat to crypto as an investme vehicle at least proof of work models that rely on mining to validate exchanges transactions ,question concerning solvency of bitcoin ,1.0,1,zom6ui,alpharustacean,0,2022-12-18 01:17:17,1671326254,1671326254,2022-12-18,01:17:17

bitcoin,hey every i just ed to share my thoughts on bitcoin with the community as a fairly new bitcoiner myself i am constaly amazed by the resilience and strenh of this revolutionary digital asset thing that really stands out to me is the deceralized nature of bitcoin un traditional financial systems that are corolled by a small group of individuals or institutions bitcoin is powered by a global network of nodes that work together to secure the blockchain this deceralization ensures that no single eity has corol over the network making it resista to censorship and corruption another aspect of bitcoin that i find particularly impressive is its ability to act as a store of value while the price of bitcoin can fluctuate in the short term its value has consistely increased over time making it a reliable investme for the long haul but perhaps what i love most about bitcoin is its poteial to bring financial freedom to people around the world in couries with unstable currencies or oppressive governmes bitcoin provides a y for individuals to take corol of their own wealth and financial future overall i am bullish on bitcoin and can't it to see what the future holds for this groundbreaking technology what about you guys why do you love bitcoin ,feeling grateful for bitcoin,1.0,1,zo7x6u,xxshadowassassin69xx,0,2022-12-17 14:53:39,1671288830,1671288830,2022-12-17,14:53:39

bitcoin,of the easiest attack possible on all blockchains is the replay attack it basically takes advaages of hard forks to a valid transaction from of the chain and broadcast it to another let s take an emple we create an hardfork called bwef bitcoin wef of course our shitcoin will be shorted on market and nobody will supports it but ethw people will they can sell it and get fee my you have btc so you received bwef trading each for k for free let s dump it quick so you nna sp you bwef on a website for free my houray in order to do this you have to send your bwef by creating a transaction and signing it you then sell and get your dollars so you got your k for a shitcoin you didn t anyy that s just a win right but here is the issue your transaction is public and is also valid on real btc chain so now an attacker can broadcast this same transaction on original chain this could be the buyer of your bwef now the buyer as received your bwef and your real btc you re sold your btc for k so now let s talk about how to protect from this afaik there is no y to protect from what i just describe the only thing we can do is to avoid ieracting with forked chains which can be difficult beca most people t their own node so when signing and broadcasting a transaction they may be sending it to a node of the forked chain so if some s more about this and would to correct me share infos how to protect or anything please do i this would help greatly community ,replay attacks on blockchains,1.0,1,zmzhpj,tyranoc4,0,2022-12-15 23:14:26,1671146085,1671146085,2022-12-15,23:14:26

bitcoin,the only thing i is missing about bitcoin technology is a y to really slowly recycle itself let me explain imagine in thé far future when all bitcoins will be mined or almost the biggest bitcoin sources available will be old storages from our time old accou lost bitcoins etc they will probably be an industry trying to found them back in a y or another the amou of lost bitcoin will be massive and compared to thé mining production they will be a time where finding only a single hard from our time could be worth of multiple year of mining production this is not a sane balance for an economy the non lost bitcoins will be d for thé economy but if they are btc holders who are too big they will own a too big of thé total amou of my to exist let s say a familly for exemple that inherited bitcoin from generation to generation they could or own stupid amou of things or acting by themselves as a modifier of bitcoin value orders of magnitudes too high probably with the ability to make prices triple or divide by easily if a my this exist in far future propose who are not privilegied by it will legitimately look ay for other solition and probably create other cryptos collectively and decide to them instead what would be a imo sane thing to do is adding a evaporating rate to bitcoin let me explain to avoid that few peoples could own too massive proportion of bitcoins and keep the currency viable and fair enough to let peoples coinue to it we could maybe add a system who could make a small évaporation raté happen so for exemple each year of the btc you own evaporate and go back to the mineable bitcoin pool numbers can vary this will also allow a reneble and consta suply of new btc this is the most equal option every have the same evapotax we could also balance this in a more fair y evaporzting bitcoin faster for biggest bitcoin holders above some cap to avoid peoples to squeeze this by dividing their wealth io multiple accou we will need them to be or nominated to a single person or to a single family and a y to make sure it is not squeezable then let s say that for each time you own x more than the average accou balance to let this method grow with increasing of decreasing population you pay twice more so per year evaporate of your btc above time the average balance above time the average above time the average k m time thé average etc etc evaporate per year at million time the average at million time at a billion time etc that also add an inceive to make thé average peoples wealthier so it will be really hard to own more than a billion time the average person wealth who seem a minimum to keep things somehow balanced of course that s random number that could be adjusted up or down that will keep the economy somewhat balanced and allow more evaporation to happen and at the same time still allow for big fortunes to exist but without having too much inequalities capped in this exemple at billion time the average beca after that evaporate per year so basically all of it we could maybe even imagine a system where the under average balances get a small perceage of wealth evaporated from big we could say that half evaporation go to mining and half to slightly lower inequalities could be a modest redistributive and fair economical system we need also a y to make peoples who die inherit their fortune to their kids to avoid the death peoples accous to cou among the total number of active accous and if not possible redistributed to the mining pool this y we could have a mtary system bitcoin with a fix amou of currency a y to slowly get back poteial lost bitcoins trough evaporation a y to slowly give back bitcoin to the mining pool and keep the suply running a y to avoid too much inequalities but still allowing fortunes to exist without allowing too indece s or monopoles to a y poteially to redistribute a part of the wealth to the less fortunate trough a part of the evaporation we could call this condensation on lower than average or average balanced accou this will be a low amou in any case beca lower than average accou and average accou will be much more in number than the above s who pay for it and that s how you keep a currency system sane stable and fiable for extremely long periods of time and make it automatically adjusted to total population number changes up or down allowing humanity to eveually becaume a multi planetary specie as we should be if we are not filtered out of existence before and that s how you also assure peoples to be able to keep a stable deceralised predictible non inflationist currency who evaporate or not at all or reaaaly slowly depending on how rich you are also putting a smaaaaal pressure on peoples to spend or invest and keep the my moving in the economy being rich is this world would only mean owning a bigger part of the cake who evaporate faster and of nothing is e or if badly d or lost will go back to average with time trough evaporation who go half to the less fortunate half for the miners who keep the thing working a bitcoin made on this kind of system could be much more viable long term and even becaume a ultimate and universal currency aly adjusting itself to any situation to go back to the society wealth distribution programated in some years and still of course remunerating miners and mining who make the system work and coinue to that s an ieresting topic imo and could be the solution to a lot of issue that today currency have or even cryptos have or even deceralised cryptos have exc my bad english ,bitcoin in the far

bitcoin,this is probably a dumb question but if you move bitcoin to a cold storage then i understand that it is not on your computer anymore and that this is more secure as you can't get hacked unless somebody gets the cold storage drive and s how to get in but if you move bitcoin to say an electrum and save the seed phrase on paper somewhere or in your head and then you delete the electrum app completely from your computer then also you would not be able to hacked via your computer if somebody gained access to it so what really is the difference or pros cons of the approaches is there anything wrong with just deleting the app and not spending extra my on a cold storage device since you can alys recover the with the seed whenever you access to the bitcoin by reinstalling the softre ,difference between cold storage and no storage ,1.0,1,zmxlnm,peelman1978,0,2022-12-15 22:07:04,1671142044,1671142044,2022-12-15,22:07:04

bitcoin,bitcoin is all about understanding and managing your own risk and trust be that the decision to run a node or not a light or not a company node or not you also have to decide who you will give your business to and what risk you're willing to expose yourself to when engaging with bitcoin services with that in mind let's conceptualize a few differe kinds of bitcoin services so we to look out for them and can make educated choices as consumers the low trust service this is a bitcoin service delivered in a low trust manner where the bitcoin r need only utilize softre they run and corol for the services and can protect themselves from malicious third parties with very little trust or consequence from peers this is the gold standard of bitcoin service emples include lightning routing lightning liquidity marketplaces pool coinjoins joinmarket coinsps submarine sps loop and others when at all possible this is the kind of service you to run many services and coracts in bitcoin or layers will claim to be low trust even deceralized which isn't all necessary for a business they are supposed to be ceralized but very few are ask yourself what recourse you al have against fraud and what fraud would be possible for emple in lightning you protect yourself from fraud by tching the blockchain and storing proof of your off chain transactions you can broadcast at will you have responsibility tch the blockchain and recourse publish transactions proving fraud and claim balance the risks revolve around your own capacity time delays locking up your coins and other general inconveniences not impacting your custody trust the service will be provided this is your typical business or website where you pay for the good or service before you get it and have little to no recourse if the service is not provided pretty normal you're risking whatever you're spending in a transaction emples include every mercha business accepting bitcoin the merchas using btcpay server and non custodial exchanges bullbitcoin s this is also a very good model with limited risk but often little recourse the federated trust service this is a bitcoin service which spreads responsibility across a number of actors for success or failure it's not nearly as good as trusting yourself and relies on third parties to protect your ierests emples include liquid rsk s peg multisig custodians bisq escrow these services often delve io shitcoins and when they do should be avoided any other the risk in these cases is often not exceptionally limited include custody and your recourse relies on third parties if any exists at all the first party custodian this bitcoin service relies on only itself it often prides itself on this self reliance boasting a lack of third parties and self custody river financial is a good emple if you can trust the business these can be quality services the risks in these custodians are similar to a federated service but only trusting party the rd party custodian this is a bitcoin service which relies on a third party custodian prime trust s emples include strike and sn s among many others while both are bitcoin only companies the custodian they rely on holds over shitcoins s these kinds of services can be dangerous beca they can appear to be very bold bitcoin only companies but on closer inspection you will find they 't self custody a ceral tena of a good bitcoin participa in the space r and business a this can expose rs to all kinds of risks and broadens the number of actors exposing rs to risk even if it's not just custody for emple kraken just leaked r data s via a zendesk leak this is why evaluating who you are trusting is importa and i make these specific emples to illustrate why you can't take even well respected community members at their word you need to evaluate for yourself are you trusting them or a tower of service providers the shitcoin casino this isn't a bitcoin service at all it's a public harm these are exchanges which service and host scams exposing their rs to the custodial risks of their shittiest shitcoin they often pri their own shitcoins they lure rs in with too good to be true fees they should be avoided at all cost emples include coinbase binance kraken gemini kucoin and many many others most others i won't be linking them beca you shouldn't them tl dr as you evaluate what kind of businesses and services you to what risks you're willing to expose yourself and your coins to and hopefully even what kind of businesses you to encourage in this space consider all your options not every service has made the same trade offs or requires the same trust consider minimizing your exposure to this coagion and not only get off exchanges and custodial services but reevaluate the services we're doing business with in the first place avoid shitcoin custodians and services lower trust solutions let's do more diligence on who we are trusting and how ,trusting bitcoin services and

bitcoin,hey every i'm fairly new to how bitcoin works and with everything that's happened recely it's no surprise i'm in the same boat as a ton of people withdrawing from exchanges but i'm trying to understand more of the inner working of bitcoin as i find the tech fascinating i withdrew all my funds from ftx thankfully on time and more recely binance and chose trust as i found their multi coin from a single mnemonic an ieresting idea and the app looks and functions great the only downside is that there's no y to access some of my s from the extension so i we with electrum to get my bitcoin address on my computer here's where my big confusion lies when i imported my from the mnemonic i got a bunch of s the first being the trust gives me i assume that's how hd s work however when converting my bip mnemonic to a bip seed importing that seed in electrum still works but i get completely differe addresses is there any logical explanation to this a friend of mine suggested maybe electrum does something to the seed but that possibly can't be the case i'd hope as a side question somewhat unrelated but i'm also wondering when i created a on trust it gave me the mnemonic as it should maybe i'm too skeptical but how is trust supposed to it can't give the same mnemonic to some else how is it made sure that no other r from any other softre hot app will ever get the same mnemonic as me thank you for your time to any that can help me understand those ps i i will get scammers and whatnot in dms i won't reply to any in dms so no need to tell me in the commes if that can spare you some writing i'm also are i showed my balance in the screenshot it's there to show that the top window imported from the mnemonic does coain the trust gave me and that the bottom imported from the seed does not thank you again ,understanding wallet imports from bitcoin hot wallets,1.0,1,zl5xfi,momoske,0,2022-12-13 20:26:00,1670963178,1670963178,2022-12-13,20:26:00

bitcoin,since bitcoin had a price people have tried to recreate it but with twists the owner of this gets a huge chunk of supply then supply gets released when mining or this has this cool developme team or technology behind it therefore better than bitcoin these recreations all focd on the idea of bitcoin as a technology when in fact even the technology d to run bitcoin is subject to change at the whims of social consensus take robux for a minute robux is a popular digital asset issued by the robux corporation it has exchanges though mostly underground for fear of reprisal from the robux corporation what is the functional difference between robux using an sql database between their servers and robux using a private blockchain where only robux servers can create the proofs of work for transfer its still permissid robux still has full say over whether transfers even happen between accous and robux is still sold by the robux corporation crypto is much more akin to robux in this y crypto is not subject to the whims of its rbase it is only subject to the corporation behind it bitcoin does not work in this y bitcoin is a social construct the bitcoin core devs have e a pretty good job at making sure nothing that would upset the people who run the softre gets through but what would happen if they did new rule block sizes will now be gb instead of mb the first problem they'd run io is that the new softre is not compatible with the softre every else is running people who run the softre would be pretty upset at hard drive space filling up rapidly and fork the project io a new repository you now have two chains but which chain is bitcoin so that's what i mean when i say bitcoin is a social construct any argume you'd make over which gets to be bitcoin is you enforcing that social construct the curre construct around what is bitcoin is that the chain that is compatible with the older softre gets to be bitcoin it but the original bitcoin github repo gets to be bitcoin i hear you scream so lets talk about the next problem the original repo would encouer from ignoring the people who run bitcoin when you a bitcoin and you 't run your own node you the node that softre defaults to now maybe that softre enforces the idea that bitcoin is the core repo but it could just as well decide to enforce the social construct that bitcoin is whatever is compatible with an older version of the softre in fact it probably would do this by default via not noticing that a new clie s even released i mean i can't help but notice that this very sub has a link to download version of core even though version s released miners and price i can't talk about the role that miners would play io this without also including how the price of each chain would effect the miners if rs prefer to chain over the other its price will go up which makes miners to mine that chain instead of the other this means the chain that goes against the rs wishes is vulnerable to the hashpower of the chain that supports r decisions being part of the domina mtary network has its perks the domina mtary network is evidence of the strenh of the social construct at hand right now the strongest social construct for my is that governme issued paper is my bitcoin is here to challenge that social construct with its own ,bitcoin is a social construct not crypto,1.0,1,zj27qc,nerd2ninja,0,2022-12-11 18:10:53,1670782265,1670782266,2022-12-11,18:10:53

bitcoin,this post is for those who have been tipped maybe the tipper linked this post to help you or you to learn more about lips on the bitcoin sub r lipbot for more official information non you can start right now without set up you just need some to tip you i recely discovered there is a tip bot that you can in the bitcoin sub and i others the great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning and then withdraw your tips or your own lightning to add sats to your personal tip jar you 't need to if some tips you sats then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your rname and add in sats to it that's the minimum tip then you can the same command in a message and tip some else no need to even set up a you can sats all you just from your own tips get them and pass them on side note you can send private messages to the bot and it will give your balance or a code to send sats to or receive sats via lightning just using the links on the bot reply to tip type lip or any number higher than it will tip the person you are replying to if you 't have the funds available in your accou for the tip then the bot creates a lightning invoice that you can pay using lightning with a setting up a lightning and adding sats to the bot a great guide from double lr tip him if he posts in commes i muun too so you are in luck it works a very small bit differe than you i am on a ph so this is what i just did to transfer sat from the tipbot balance to my muun very easy you ll see prior to doing this you must have the fully set up get your seed phrase words aka your keys and write them down and keep them safe then do the rescue emergency pdf thing too it s pretty easy and worth the hassle of figuring it out after that open muun and select receive at the top there are two option buttons select lightning and the screen will change to a lightning address at the bottom you will see invoice settings select that and you will see a button to add an amou and an expiry time for the invoice press add and eer the amou you to withdraw from the tipbot balance press confirm and the invoice will change again to the address that represes what you just created an invoice for the amou of sats you eered press copy and the invoice will be copied to your clipboard in your ph open reddit and find a tipbot message it has the blue links in it you see it every time a tip is given press withdraw and it will create the dm format for you once you learn the format very simple you can create it from scratch a normal dm but the blue link does this for you uil you learn the format well enough to create it on your own on the dm page created by the blue link there is a spot that says put_invoice_here delete only that simple phrase and then paste in to the same spot and your invoice you copied earlier will appear the line that says withdraw needs to stay where it is press send open muun as fast as you can and see if you can beat the withdral to your from reddit enjoy fellow redditor it seems a lot but i m reality steps will become step for you and steps will also become step for you so once you learn it it s basically two steps lightning is badass enjoy fellow redditor general help some ful faq type information not included on the bot website if you are clueless then hopefully this list will give you enough information to start to google the gaps in your ledge what is bitcoin it's a digital commodity gold but much easier to transport what are sats each bitcoin is made of a million sats dollars and ces but with lots more sats per bitcoin to make paymes easier what is lightning the bitcoin nextwork is slow and super secure great for transfer of large amous of my but not good for tips and coffee so clever people built a second layer on top and that is the lighting network it allows you to send sats super fast and cheap what is a bot an automated service to help you 't worry about sending messages to it as long as you 't change the words it's just sending a command to a computer and it will return your answer privately do i need a perhaps not you can be given tips and then check your balance here on reddit and only tip others using your tips a great little circular community but then i do need a yes when you either have so many tips on your reddit ln bot accou that you to withdraw them fully or them in the real world then you will need a or if you have no tips and to tip then you will need a what's a reddit ln bot accou the clever people who made this tip bot made it so you automatically get a little just for with the bot only attached to your rname that the bot can to track your tips and balances smart what's a lightning a lightning probably an app that you can install the app allows transfer of bitcoin sats to any other s great for buying stuff in locations that accept bitcoin sending bitcoin or sats to your friends l and for sending sats to fill your tip accou where do i get a lightning when youre ready to google it and find you anything else to only last bit if you tip more than you have availabille or you try to make a deposit clicking and sending deposit as a message to the bot then the clever bot will give you a long number code that you can copy and eer io your lightning app to make a payme when you do you will have d bitcoin and passed a tip to some else how nice of you the code side of ln bot here's the github for the lip bot more really importa stuff if you post in a comme and it's ful i'll copy io here as an edit ,lntip ,1.0,1,zivudc,edislucky,0,2022-12-11

bitcoin,i recely stumbled upon the meme 'is this good for bitcoin yes ' and i believe it's a phenomenal meme it's so simple yet incredibly clever that's it that's the meme this meme says it all it doesn't matter if people talk shit about bitcoin what matters is that people talk about bitcoin beca whether they talk positively or negatively bitcoin will be meid and every meion yields areness in marketing this is called a 'brand touch poi' it takes a long time for a new product uil mass adoption happens new customers first need to hear about get ierested research and finally make a purchase decision that doesn't happen over night the first step before any can start his bitcoin journey is therefore areness you 't start your bitcoin journey unless you see bitcoin in the news or hear friends talk about it the diagram shows that every sale is offset by atteion ierest desire and conviction from frank hutchinson dukesmith editor of salesmanship as bitcoin ehusiasts we tend to forget that we all started at zero at some poi do you remember when you first heard about bitcoin you probably read an article that s shitting on bitcoin and you dismissed it you see it's just normal that bad news is part of the journey but bad news is good news and here is why the purchase funnel feels it has been around forever it is in every marketing course book and is meid at least once in every clie meeting so when a clie exclaimed it feels we ve d this thing for years i decided to check turns out we have well marketers anyy years to be ect whether you call it the customer funnel sales funnel marketing funnel aida or just funnel each serves the same purpose the funnel shows how a customer ultimately makes the decision to buy a product source bad news is good news beca it still helps bitcoin at the very beginning of the funnel is areness and bad news help to make people are that bitcoin exists the streisand effect is a name for the phenomenon in which attempts to hide censor or preve access to something have the opposite result the uniended consequence of drawing far more atteion to that thing here is a hypothetical emple of the streisand effect some posts an embarrassing photo of a celebrity online around people see it the celebrity takes legal action to enforce its removal upon learning of the legal action the media covers the story as a result millions of people seek out and view the photo the upside the celebrity will see the number of followers increase and his or her popularity rise following the news the streisand effect is a great emple of how trying to hide or preve access to something can actually end up drawing more atteion to it this phenomenon can be seen in many differe coexts but of the most ieresting emples is the y that the media often tries to talk shit about bitcoin at first glance it might seem the media's consta criticism of bitcoin would be bad for bitcoin after all negative news stories can often have a negative impact on people's perceptions of a particular topic however when it comes to bitcoin the opposite seems to be true every time the media talks shit about bitcoin it seems to only end up drawing more atteion to it and increasing its popularity so let the haters come they all feed the algo ,bitcoin always wins even if the media talks shit about it,1.0,1,zgxw4x,ymerglobal,0,2022-12-09 13:52:13,1670593949,1670593950,2022-12-09,13:52:13

bitcoin,so from what i've gathered there's multiple catalysts for bitcoin price next year despite a looming recession which is a fact at this poi first is the halvening obvious by the end of there should be the peak and preceding that hopefully a long uprd trend tords a minimum of k per bitcoin according to models that have a historical price accuracy of bitcoins value should peak at around m per bitcoin in average recession lasts for around mohs so by the time this will be over bitcoins price should be around k at the end of next year beginning of second is the gaap accouing standard next year this law will be improved so that companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet will be able to write them at their fair value currely if the price goes down in value but jumps back up again companies have to write down the value of the digital asset and can't mark it up starting from next year it will be differe which apparely has been a deal breaker for institutional investors in the past third is the capital inflow of traditional investors investme banks pension funds ceral banks small big couries and differe funds currely holding digital assets in their portfolio is considered to be risky due to the absence of regulation transparency public disclosings from the beginning of next year january the united states congress will be having a session where the sec and congress will both fight over which eity gets to set the rules they both seem to be in a hurry to be the first s which is a positive for crypto investors as the institutions feel safer to invest the capital inflow should be somewhere around trillion usd for the price to reach k at the end of next year curre price would have to quadruple so approximately trillion usd would be sufficie total amou of assets held by mutual funds in the us is trillion usd germany has trillion and uk brazil and switzerland collectively own trillion usd that's close to trillion if of this would go to bitcoin its price would quadruple another scenario would be where we would consider the multiplier effect x of investing in the stock market in which only billion of capital inflow from institutional investors would be necessary to reach a trillion market cap x billion usd trillion i included switzerland beca its ceral bank has said it's ierested in acquiring bitcoin there's a few other poteial catalysts in the future that might shape the perception of cryptocurrencies to a positive in the coming year big couries iran russia adopting cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and the pilot of cbdcs also ukraine is of the largest bitcoin holders so there are multiple concrete things to look forrd to in next year and especially the year after despite the coming recession the biggest factors for a long bear phase are imo rising oil prices and ierest rates uil the end of next year in addition to that revolving and non revolving credits are at an all time high while the savings rate of americans is at an all time low if the recession will last around mohs it should be a relatively sound timing for the price to shoot up to k per bitcoin during the third picture is metcalf's law which predicts the value to be minimum k by it's not as delicious as the other two models but still dece considering the fact that it would be the minimum value according to this model the value would be minimum m usd during and hover above m uil it reaches during next decade these are just some thoughts things i've gathered hope some finds it ful cheers ,catalysts for bitcoin ,1.0,1,zg8are,alexipoika123,0,2022-12-08 19:12:13,1670526747,1670526748,2022-12-08,19:12:13

bitcoin,as you might the lightning network started back in march and serves as payme layer to scale the transaction speed of the bitcoin network and reduce the cost per transaction at the same time due to the lack of liquidity it s really hard to actually send paymes at the beginning while it became easier to participate in the network there are still challenges to solve in order to make it accessible for the broader mass of the main problems is the need to create an invoice each time you to receive a payme from a ux perspective this is absolutely horrible lnurl and bolt try to solve some of these issues which i will try to explain in the following part lnurl what ectly is that lnurl is a stack of simple protocols for coordinating information needed to make paymes over the lightning network using the full list of lnurl protocol pieces can be found here but i'm just going to go io a few core s that overlap with bolt the three core features of the lnurl protocol are defined as lnurl auth where a public key can be d to log in to a service lnurl pay where a can ping a server through a static qr code and retrieve an invoice lnurl withdraw where a can ping a server and request that the server pays an invoice provided by the for using the autheication protocol the server provides a randomly generated number which the r's signs with a newly generated key after the server retrieves the signed randomly generated number the key gets saved and can be d for future logins the invoice request functionality is a y to provide information to a r about a payme they wish to make in a format that is not an invoice this provides a description of the payme the minimum and maximum amou the service expects to be paid and a url for the from which to request an actual invoice from here the displays this information to the r allowing them to set a final amou and request an invoice after sending the invoice request and receiving back from the server the verifies that the amous match what the r set and pays the invoice note this feature is already available if you're using phoenix of satoshi or blue muun does not support it as of now december the withdral request works by pinging the service and receiving in response a description a url to send an invoice to a random string and a minimum amou and maximum amou that can be withdrawn after filling in the appropriate value the returns an invoice to the server and if it is valid and within the amou parameters the service pays the invoice the lnurl autheicate protocol can be d in addition to this to ensure that only the iended r can successfully withdraw using the lnurl link common case would be if you to withdraw your sats from a lightning service such as the lipbot here on reddit or the lot on telegram bolt why do we need it the term bolt is the acronym for b asis o f l ightning t echnology you can compare these to the bips bitcoin improveme proposals which are design documes for iroducing features or information to bitcoin the bip as amended has since become the standard y of formally communicating ideas about poteial bitcoin improvemes as meid at the beginning of this post there are some ux flaws which need to be addressed to understand the problems bolt attempts to solve it is mandatory to have a look at the curre standard which is d to create invoices bolt invoices generated by the bolt standard consist of three main comps the destination where the payme is supposed to be se to public key of the node the amou which is about to be transferred a hash which represes the payme secret the main problem of bolt invoices is that they can only be d once and therefore need to be created in realtime the creation of the invoice leads to the publishing of the payme secret and is therefore unsecure if you would create an invoice with the same secret some could fraudulely request my due to the fact that the secret is n this makes the usage of qr code invoices for ations or other cases impossible what is bolt bolt offers an attempt to achieve some of the core functionality that lnurl provides without requiring the of a web server an offer encodes the data necessary to reach a node to request an invoice to make a payme either a node _id or a blinded path the last few hops in an onion route pre computed and encrypted to that node using onion messages it also can encode a minimum amou for a payme the currency being paid in an expiry time and minimum maximum quaity numbers for purchasing multiple items this is all of the information necessary to fetch an actual invoice from the node that issued the offer some who s to pay an invoice does so over onion messages of the core features of bolt it allows nodes to make a direct end to end encrypted connection between each other that does not involve a lightning channel just lightning paymes these can be d to onion route messages after obtaining an offer a payer will the information encoded in it to send an invoice _request message the creator of the offer will then respond back with an actual invoice there is also support for generating unique per r offers that allow the receiver to request a payme from the creator of the offer similar to lnurl's withdral request feature bolt invoices commit to a unique payer key this can be d in the case of issuing refunds to prove you are the person who actually paid the invoice this can also be d in combination with the withdral offer to guaraee that only the correct person can succeed in getting an invoice paid by the creator as opposed to whoever is able to get a copy of the offer what's best both lnurl and bolt enable a more r friendly y for paying or getting paid on the lightning network while lnurl sits on the application level bolt provides a solution on proctocol level where the new offers do neither require a web server tls certificates nor a domain and provide a higher level of protection than lnurl using blinded paths the bolt offers allow the confideiality of the node id which additionally enriches the privacy it's importa to say both solutions can exist simultaneously while online shops and other service providers operate a web server anyy lnurl is a good add on bolt mostly addresses the endrs and offers a more convenie y to ieract with the lightning network ,what's lnurl and bolt ,1.0,1,zfw1ek,mcrech,0,2022-12-08

bitcoin,i seem to remember every halving being approached with some trepidation as to how the miners would adapt historically price goes up and more hash power gets turned on can this happen another times in my simple understanding each halving will double the cost of production for most commodities the price will reach equilibrium near the cost or production assuming more halvings assuming a curre cost of about per btc which i is a low estimate this puts the bitcoin cost of production at x or over t per btc in this seems kind of absurd especially since it assumes the difficulty and hash rate stay consta to what they are today in given the trajectory of hash rate it should be safe to assume the difficulty will be much higher in than in this would mean the cost of production is even higher than t and the market price would need to be higher than t btc to support this that would put the market cap at m x t or quiillion again an absurd number as this is in t odays dollars inflation would make this even higher another possibility is that the hash rate reaches a maximum and then starts to drop off if the difficulty is too high miners will have to drop out of the race and reduce the difficulty and cost to be under the market price this would lead to ceralization or at least a reduction in the number of eities corolling the mining hash rate i understand that at some poi most of the block rerds will be in transaction fees but how does this impact the overall economics of cost of production the fees are currely running around of the block rerd though when the network is busy it has spiked to from what i can tell the fees will stay relatively the same in absolute btc earned but the coinbase rerd gets reduced with the halvings this seems it would put a cap on cost of mining a block thats something x what it is today so this would put cost of blocks around m and since that's for btc today that would cap it around m cap to btc more realistic but not sure the math holds up ,impact of more halvings,1.0,1,zcrzj9,arnzenarms,0,2022-12-05 01:02:54,1670202190,1670202191,2022-12-05,01:02:54

bitcoin,i'm not sure how ectly i began down this bitcoin austrian economics rabbit hole but about a week ago it led me to two faastic yet very distressing books the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard both written by saifedean ammous i'm kind of assuming that these books are well n amongst the bitcoin community i apologize if that's not actually the case the gist is basically fiat my trash bitcoin hard my good although it obviously goes io a lot more depth than that frankly i have felt very out of my depth reading these books and trying to about economics this past week or so i am able to read the argumes preseed and find them compelling and see the logic in them but i am left somewhat frazzled by them i 't what to make of them ammous does a good job of putting things simply for a bitcoin neophyte myself but for some reason i still struggle to fully comprehend everything i find nothing wrong with ammous' core argumes and hstly i'm kind of alarmed by that is this every's response to reading these books what do mainstream economists who read them have to say about them for me to be okay he's right and go about my life i have to pretty much every in governme is clueless which isn't that crazy i suppose but i still feel a need to seek out some sort of couerargume to these books before i make that conclusion anyys i've been looking with not much success for some sort of response from the mainstream pov to the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard preferably preseing couerargumes to ammous' various pois any suggestions ,best counterarguments available to the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard ,1.0,1,zbpija,blueball00ns,0,2022-12-03 20:17:29,1670098663,1670098664,2022-12-03,20:17:29

bitcoin,what we are beginning to see with energy production in places kazakhstan and tes is using bitcoin mining as a sort of financial battery to store the value of produced energy digitally and then to this value to trade between energy producers based on need this will make energy markets more efficie and make energy grids more resilie you can produce at below peak times and then buy at peak times with the bitcoin mined at other times you can produce a sellable asset with ste energy and energy resources to offset the cost of production this is faastic but a less talked about subseque effect of this that i possibly naively foresee is the increasing competition for energy by consumers vs bitcoin miners often the energy producers themselves a time will come if this coinues when an energy producer will ask what's more profitable mining or selling the energy to consumers and when that happens the price of energy will begin to be dictated by the price of bitcoin how much you pay for electricity will be tightly correlated with how much bitcoin can be harvested with that energy and how much in fiat it can be sold for once this happens bitcoin then becomes a sort of de facto reserve currency for bitcoin markets the price of energy will become volatile as the price of bitcoin and it would make sense then to price energy directly in bitcoin bitcoin will become the unit of accou in energy markets once this happens i expect bitcoin to grow out of just the energy industry as a unit of accou over time and begin to be d as a unit of accou for more and more markets since energy costs are so fundameal to the costs of most other things this phenomenon we are seeing now the of bitcoin mining to extract value from ste energy will directly lead to bitcoin being d as a unit of accou worldwide perhaps i'm missing something but i 't so ,the use for bitcoin mining in stabilizing energy markets is very interesting,1.0,1,zboc1v,ur_mothers_keeper,0,2022-12-03 19:28:46,1670095738,1670095739,2022-12-03,19:28:46

bitcoin,hello i s wondering for a friend how to technically get cryptocurrencies circulating supply for the sake of simplicity for now i narrowed my focus on bitcoin bitcoin forked based altcoin the truth is the cryptocurrency node and it exposes the value i'm looking for over the rpc api command gettxoutsetinfo so the probably most naive y would be but perhaps the most reliable to run nodes of each bitcoin and bitcoin forked based altcoin and later on query each of them you would agree that it's horrible running a bitcoin node is good and good for health though as it cost proper set _up deployme maienance bandwith hosting computing blabla then i remembered every i node when initiating a dns seeds the primary y to discover peers in the bitcoin network is to connect to a list of btc nodes that are previously connected however for the initial connection the node has to a publicly n dns feed to retrieve a list of ip addresses of long running stable nodes so it's available in the code directly and it's easily scalable under master src chainparams cpp then searching for vseeds unfortunately as gettxoutsetinfo is computed by the node with indexed data from the blockchain sync it means it's also not available from the protocol perspective of course so having a list of a crypto nodes appart for a crawling job in my case looks a dead end then i though maybe i can fetch each node address and hope misconfigured or expose it's node rpc api publicly as it is not standart to have it enable by default does not seems realiable but i 't see another y i would be happy to hear any suggestion idea if you have ,how to get cryptocurrencies circulating supply from the source ,1.0,1,zbgfi0,omygrog,0,2022-12-03 13:34:21,1670074478,1670074479,2022-12-03,13:34:21

bitcoin,im confd and no has explained this in an understandable y as in margin call talk to me im a labrador or a small child when i send bitcoin to another it arrives in a minute or two i can then spend that bitcoin what happens in that or two minutes before you answer there are several words that are often confd which is verify validate confirm and finalise first there is the ledger which is spread across thousands of computers i myself run a copy on my old laptop but im not a miner is it these random computers the transaction immediately travels to that detect invalid transactions are we network nodes on the image it shows at secs the transaction is propagated and validated by the network nodes and this happens before the miners eer the process so the ledger computers have validated the transactions and these computers mine must be the network nodes the next step it says miners include the transaction in the next block to be mined this looks the first meeting between miners and transactions they have validated anything at this stage next step says mining time if the transactions are already validated what does the mining do at this poi the winning miner who solves the puzzle is rerded with some bitcoin then it says the nodes my node on my laptop verify the result and propagate the block i t understand what this means at the end it says new confirmations appear with each new block created i thought the private and public keys being the digital signatures would be the first level of verification or validation which is the correct word when keys all match up and the transaction is se and received is that a validation of sorts do the miners verify or validate transactions and if so when ectly do they confirm them at what stage is a transaction finalised if a transaction is finalised when i receive it how can it be ok to spend straight ay are the miners called full nodes i am a node thru my old laptop to check on the miners they are following the rules so are the network nodes the ledgers the full nodes the miners and the nodes the verifiers of the miners thanku ,please explain the bitcoin transaction process ,1.0,1,za90pd,iamkingcliff,0,2022-12-02 02:50:21,1669949437,1669991344,2022-12-02,02:50:21

bitcoin,in a nutshell banks are a bit ftx highly leveraged and can't sustain a bank run in many cases fortunately deposits are insured in the us the insured amou is up to k and the eu up to k prior the financial crisis of if banks were too big to fail the governme taxpayers would save them but since the cost of doing so is becoming too big they iroduced bail ins instead of bail outs bail ins mean that banks can take their customers deposits if they are insolve basically they can legally do what sbf did to pay their bills the governme won't step in anymore the bank will just steal your deposits to save them and no you won't get them back fortunately you are still protected up to the insured amou k but everything above can be taken from you now if we assume that there will be another financial banking crisis which is almost certain and if we assume the next crisis will be bigger than the last which is also ly beca that is what we have seen in the past it's just a question of time before some people are going to lose a lot of my in a bank that s supposed to be regulated trusted and safe s ,i think bail ins are another reason why bitcoin will become more popular over time if you don't know what bail ins are learn more about them and educate your friends and family ,1.0,1,z5yhvh,bitcorner22,0,2022-11-27 11:01:27,1669546922,1669817895,2022-11-27,11:01:27

bitcoin,hey y'all long time lurker around these and other crypto related parts of reddit i figured this would be the best community to ask an hst question i have regarding self custody and its idealized future with the rece collapse of ftx the greater crypto community has been beating the drum of returning to the fundameals and the importance of not your keys not your crypto i s listening to an ierview on the breakdown with jesse powell of kraken this evening and he seemed to imply that the idea of keeping cash in a shoebox under your bed s some sort of perfect model for how people kept my in the past he s drawing the comparison to keeping cash under your bed in a shoebox in the old days and it felt he s romaicizing it the implication is that keeping your crypto in cold storage on a hardre is what every should be doing i do this i've e this since i understood the importance of it when i first got io crypto in early i i'm a baby i sn't affected at all by the collapse of ftx even though i'd purchased from them in the past self custody makes sense to me it's certainly of the values i ideify with and understand as importa to the space simply put we 't some ceralized organizations able to freeze our assets corol how we spend our my or in anyy affect our decisions surrounding it with all that being said here's my question if the idealized future of self custody is realized how does that look for the normal person and will it ever include the same conveniences assurances that large ceralized banks offer the idea of keeping cash under my bed is frankly ridiculous there's so many things that can go wrong my ho could be broken io and my shoebox taken i could lose the shoebox the shoebox could be taken by a family member if i ever to spend that my i have to go home and physically get the cash to spend it somewhere the list goes on virtually all the same problems exist today with cryptocurrency but to some degree they're even worse to spend some of my crypto i'd better have my physical hardre on me or i'd at least better have transferred some of it to a location that i can access it from the iernet what happens if my ho burns down maybe i stored my seed phrase in another location but that's kind of a lot to ask isn't it what happens if my hardre malfunctions what happens if the company that owns the hardre pushes a bad firmre softre update sure i can alys restore that with my seed phrase but holy shit what a painful process not to meion the learning curve on all of it is certainly non trivial i'm a softre engineer a lot of the ieractions iuitively makes some sense to me i won't get too much io how the expectation of asking some non technical year old person is fairly ridiculous i imagine a lot of that will be ird out over the years as we find a more seamless y to set s up and ieract with them i my question to focus around is there a world where self custody is ever as convenie as trusting some ceralized agency with a massive infrastructure and the motivation for people to spend my is convenience and to a certain degree security fraud protection insurance etc simply a trade off of having direct corol over your my or does crypto have some long term solution for that i'm just too close minded to imagine will i alys have to carry my hardre around with me just curious to hear from others thanks ,a question around the future of self custody,1.0,1,z3b6ek,pgowdy13,0,2022-11-24 05:18:48,1669267138,1669818724,2022-11-24,05:18:48

bitcoin,hi all apologies for the long post but i'm just doing some thought experimes and this s of them i 't have enough ledge about the mining side of btc to go through with this but my question is pretty much the title and i'd to see what others and hopefully some reasonings on why this isn't an issue below are some assumptions behind the reasoning of this thought i understand the chances are incredibly low for all of these things happening but i'm still curious to and i it would be a good discussion i'm also are of the difficulty adjustme per poi but bear with me so i'm assuming btc price stays low suppressed miners get priced out due to unprofitability a lot and i mean a lot of miners stop mining within a short time horizon to preve further losses i e multiple large mining pools stop mining so much so that there are far too many blocks uil the next difficulty adjustme now there are a fraction of the miners left on the network tasked with solving blocks but the hash rate has been reduced heavily resulting in a disproportid difficulty level to hash rate blocks are then solved incredibly slowly and require a heavy amou of energy input and cost to solve still resulting in a poteial loss even if we assume miners would receive a higher subsidy said another y i'm assuming that although less miners would be eitled to more of the block rerds aka would make it more profitable for them this increase in rerds is offset by the large increase in cost to solve the block removing any additional profitability and keeping them in a loss positiohis then leads me to a few question what the title is asking is the mining difficulty adjustme calculation weighted more tords the near term and would it help solve this issue after slowly solving the remaining blocks well above the desired average minute blocktime i'd appreciate any good resources on learning about the difficulty adjustme can something this be mitigated is it crucially importa for the average block to be solved every minutes what happens if became block per hour or worse than that i would this is importa as it helps preserve the security of the network and to keep the costs to attack the network high via double spending or making a longer manipulated chaihat's the exte of my thoughts and questions i'm no expert probably clear to some of you haha but ed to ask anyy thanks ,can bitcoin fail or face a lot of difficulty if mining difficulty gets too high and miners get priced out due to unprofitability or some other cause ,1.0,1,z29jlz,sigsysigs,0,2022-11-23 00:01:09,1669161685,1669819074,2022-11-23,00:01:09

bitcoin,as online merchas experime with crypto and start accepting crypto paymes they are often irigued by the idea of accepting multiple cryptocurrencies but as time goes by most of them often realize that there is really no real benefit of doing so and the best crypto to accept is bitcoin it is the only crypto that has the most r base and the only that is still standing today and will in the future even many crypto payme gateys for some reason also it's lucrative to offer crypto options for their rs but it's actually disadvaageous for online merchas who start accepting shitcoins on their webstores only to see their value drop or go to zero suddenly in the long run the safest bet is bitcoin whenever people ask me what's the best route to start accepting crypto my advice is alys to start with bitcoin and take it from there and gateys that are noncustodial and 't ask for kyc if privacy is a concern there are many payme gateys that make it simple for online merchas to start accepting bitcoin on their online stores and 't ask for id docs such as blockonomics gourl and btcpay server starting simple is alys the best y and experimeing with too many altcoins especially without prior ledge is risky ,with time most online merchants are realizing the benefits of accepting bitcoin in their online stores and dumping other altcoins ,1.0,1,z1t910,primalfabric,0,2022-11-22 13:11:46,1669122723,1669819249,2022-11-22,13:11:46

bitcoin,first of all i believe in the future of bitcoin and dca weekly as an investme however there seems to be huge weaknesses that i'd to learn more about from this community to satisfy my naivete storage it's complicated 't hold your coins in an exchange not your keys not your coins etc if the goal is world adoption then i feel the barrier of ery is pretty high for people to safely store coins they have to buy on a trusted exchange then transfer them to a hardre where they are difficult to spend when the r is ready to many this process is confusing and expensive is there something i'm missing here loss of coins there will only ever be million coins however any r that is safely storing off an exchange risks total loss if they forget lose their keys that is a huge risk sure less coins in circulation may increase the value of those that remain but on a long enough timescale all could be poteially lost i suppose hiding cash in your mattress uil your ho burns down is a comparable emple but that seems far less ly than losing your keys ,please address my perceived weaknesses of bitcoin,1.0,1,z18v31,psychedelic_dolphin,0,2022-11-21 20:11:36,1669061514,1669819449,2022-11-21,20:11:36

ethereum,i understand the idea of roll ups to scale ethereum by rolling up many transactions io and using the security of the ethereum blockchain but i 't understand how side chains are really ethereum l solutions if all transactions are taking place on a separate blockchain and never being recorded on the ethereum blockchain how is that scaling ethereum if ethereum were to disappear the value of polygon might go down but it seems to me it would still be able to operate as its own blockchain it's just profiting off of the ethereum name while having almost nothing really to do with the ethereum blockchain that said i've heard that the polygon network has started iegrating roll up l solutions too but let's ignore polygon specifically and just focus on the issue of sidechains as a scaling solution can any explain to me how they are actually scaling solutions and not just parasites ,how exactly are side chains like polygon related to ethereum other than using an erc token ,1.0,1,10bqzq1,samvega_california,0,2023-01-14 15:23:27,1673709821,1673709821,2023-01-14,15:23:27

ethereum,although i have high hopes for blockchain gaming there are certain evide problems that might limit widespread adoption and give the pe nft gaming industry more negative publicity i would add to the list some of these issues most people say that nft games are not fun i s of them uil i started checking out coinfaasy or gods unchained it's true that there have been a ton of game tokens and releases in the nft space recely and many of them look garbage with very questionable gameplay it becomes tough to keep gamers engaged when the gameplay is extremely repetitive and there are less than minutes of it people just stop playing the game when they stop making my overall the majority of curre pe games feel more a job with the worst kind of grind would you agree how about a high ery barrier the majority of casual players simply cannot pay the admission cost it cas two related problems first the game is inaccessible to regular rs which hinders long term r growth second investors are typically traders rather than gamers the developers receive little input when the investors 't actually play the game and the game gradually dies poor tokenomics is probably of the common issues traders buy nfts and hire gamers scholars to play the game using these nfts scholars make my in the form of native crypto tokens investors and gamers dump the token on new investors however once new investors stop to join the game there is no exit liquidity for curre investors we all that traditional gamers hate nfts but i believe that of the problems is that investors have unrealistic expectations despite the fact that there are many problems with this sort of gaming in general i believe that we should give it a try beca there are many faastic games what do you about all of the problems i've meid will they soon be resolved that in my opinion is the crucial eleme that will allow games to advance even further ,what are the main problems pe games need to solve to become mainstream ,1.0,1,109c9sd,turtlepajama,0,2023-01-11 18:41:06,1673462476,1673462477,2023-01-11,18:41:06

ethereum,and from this i understand that a transaction between eoa_a and a smart coract can trigger transfers of token from the eoa_a that se the transaction to another eoa_b but this transfer of token between eoa_a to eoa_b is not recorded on the blockchain my question now is if is ierested in tracking and be alerted by all activities on an accou how will do this for emple if i to be notified when tokens are transfered to eoa_b given the fact that the token transfer from eoa_a to eoa_b does not show up in any transaction how can i be notified based on my ledge y could be to listen to transfer eves on smart coracts but follow up questions as far as i understand it is possible for a smart coract to impleme the transfer methods without emitting the transfer eve not good practice but nothing stopping this from happening which makes me this approach of listening to the transfer eve might not be fool proof the transfer method and transfer eves are standardized part of erc token but i can imagine that there are other methods and operations peculiar to certain smart coracts not standardized but that will also lead to token transfer from eoa to another so that means an approach of listening to just the transfer eve will miss these kinds of token moveme so again the question how can track all eves' especially token and eth transfers in and out of an eoa given the technical drawbacks i listed below are there some ledge about the workings of ethereum that i do not about that could make this possible ,how to track for certain all addresses affected by a transaction ,1.0,1,109816k,finlaydotweber,0,2023-01-11 15:54:16,1673452469,1673452470,2023-01-11,15:54:16

ethereum,here we get queries on this subject all the time so i thought i'd clear the air when you dispose of cryptocurrency to pay for a fee you may trigger a capital gain tax c eve on the disposal value of the fee itself depending on your tax jurisdiction of course as a result this capital gain loss is realised on the difference between the acquisition and disposal price of the cryptocurrency before paying for the fee as an emple you purchase eth to for fees at the price of some time later you decide to mi an nft the gas fees for this mi are paid for in eth and you pay a gas fee of eth at the time of the sale the price of eth is now as a result you've actually made a gain on the eth itself which s d as a gas fee the reason why is beca the acquisition value of the eth s and the disposal value of the eth is therefore this will trigger a capital gains eve of for the sale of the eth which s d for gas while this may seem obvious to some you'd be surprised how many people forget to accou for this in their capital gains calculations hope that clarifies things and feel free to read more on this here ,crypto taxes are eth gas fees taxable ,1.0,1,106ymuu,miker5659,0,2023-01-08 23:58:28,1673222327,1673222327,2023-01-08,23:58:28

ethereum, the truth about cbdcs ominous design revealed a digital prison is being built in the shadows massive overreach of ceral banks undery they are designing a new kind of my allowing them to establish ceralized settleme of all paymes tie digital ideities to all transactions and record them on a ceral bank ledger forever force built in features such as limits on how much cbdc you can have in your accou negative ierest rates accou charges in line with regulatory objectives and caps on conversions and spending create my that is traceable programmable table and subject to the mtary whims of ceral planners st out spending without permission and slowly phase out cash the r on my coinues the aim to replace cash with a system of ceralized corol over all transactions and accou balances this report explains ectly what to expect from ceral bank digital currencies cbdcs it looks at the possible design options what ceral banks have decided so far and the ly outcomes the ugly conclusion is that cbdcs are a new form of currency that allows a small group of unelected people corol over what we can and cannot do with our own my lt what is going on _a lot has been said and written about cbdcs most s speculation but now evidence emerges of what is being built given that our financial system is complex cannot just click a button and iroduce a cbdc as of now much work has already been e and much is still to be e this report traces the historical path of the developme of cbdcs we start with looking at what cbdcs are then we look at why we need them as explained by the bank of iernational settlemes bis next we look at how cbdcs are designed as the ceral regulator of ceral banks the bis made an inveory of all the differe design options for cbdcs it also provided an hst accou of the poteial benefits and downsides of those choices with this ledge we can analyze the design choices made so far we observe how the european ceral bank ecb is going full steam ahead with their cbdc we come to the shocking discovery that the most importa design choices have already been made and that there have even been companies hired to start programming next we analyze what is happening in the us the us federal reserve fed is not as far advanced with their cbdc as the ecb however their frank report reveals that their cbdc design choices result in similar corol mechanisms as that of the ecb and it even exposes possible sinister motives to put it bluly what ceral banks are choosing for design so far tells us all we need to about where this is heading authorities are downplaying what is going on and pretending that all is open for debate and subjected to the democratic process but the designs they are secretly pushing forrd open the door to the dystopian future we all fear lt what are ceral bank digital currencies _before we can coinue we have to define cbdcs after all we already have digital my but cbdcs and what we currely as digital my are very differe things what we currely refer to as digital my is not issued by the ceral bank in the modern financial system the ceral bank only creates my in the form of cash bills and coins and cash deposits with banks all other my is created by private banks that s right the digital my currely in is created by private institutions the digital units in your bank accou are issued by a private bank cbdcs on the corary are digital public my issued by the ceral bank cbdcs are a totally new kind of my with many new features to summarize we go from two types to three types of retail my cash public my curre digital my private my curre cbdc public my new source ecb digital euro our future my note that cbdcs are esseially just differe forms of the same currency unit of cash is on par with unit of cbdc they are ierchangeable for reasons explained later these forms of my are also iended to exist alongside each other for the foreseeable future to summarize ceral banks are issuing a new version of my which is a liability of the ceral bank as such cbdcs are not just another form of digital my as public my they are more comparable to the other form of public my cash this begs the question why do we need an addition replaceme for cash lt why do we need cbdcs according to ceral banks _there is much debate on why cbdcs are being rolled out to avoid speculation we will stick with what the bis has said about why we need cbdcs this approach helps us to understand the decisions ceral banks have taken and what the logical outcome will be financial stability and the reduced role of public myover the past few years cash has become less popular this preses a problem beca as shown cash is currely the only form of public my d by the public retail and so when cash is phased out so is public my a principal concern of ceral banks is that if in the future cash were no longer widely accepted or available a severe financial crisis in the private financial system might create further havoc by disrupting day to day business and retail transactions cbdcs would be a y to keep the economy functioning mtary policyanother benefit of cbdcs touted by the bis is that they allow for a more direct influence on mtary policy argumes for issuing a cbdc include poteial strenhening of the pass through of the policy rate to my markets and deposit rates and helping to alleviate the zero or effective lower bound constrai the bis also argues for direct stimulus let s take a look at each benefit strenhening of the pass through of the policy rate means more corol over the ierest rates charged throughout the financial system ceral banks wish to bypass private banks and set rates directly from the mome that hoholds consider a cbdc to be an alternative to commercial bank deposits banks will have less scope for independely setting the ierest rate on deposits of the general public the zero lower bound describes the limit of negative ierest rates in short in an environme of increasingly lower ierest rates on bank accous people might pull their my out of the bank it is after all better to hold cash than my in an accou that charges deep negative ierest rates to address this issue the imf circulated a paper called breaking through the zero lower bound it explores the idea of having differe ierest rates for differe forms of my for emple an additional ierest rate on cash can very easily be charged on private banks through what is n as the cash window at the ceral bank the ceral bank charges the regular banks for the of cash and the banks then charge the rs through extra fees on withdrals and deposits this y the of cash can be made more expensive than digital forms of my this mechanism can be applied to steer the of differe forms of my and even be a stepping st on the road to a cashless society as you ll see later the imf s idea of differe ierest rates for differe kinds of my is vigorously embraced by ceral banks for emple the nigerian ceral bank d this idea to restrict cash shortly after iroducing their unpopular cbdc and finally according to the bis cbdcs could facilitate a more direct distribution of fiscal stimulus to those members of the general public who need it this could make such policies more effective than general helicopter my or distribution through the indirect and imperfect banking channels which have been d in the past financial inclusionanother buzzword ceral banks to is financial inclusion with a cbdc every could have access to basic financial services this would be especially ieresting for people not served by the curre financial system which is a situation more prevale outside the developed world but as alys much else in the diversity and inclusion agenda these rosy goals are mostly a facade of the most promine organisations behind financial inclusion is the united nations for whom the financial inclusion agenda allows the unlocking of public and private resources to fund their sustainable developme goals the un in turn coordinates its policies through the better than cash alliance an ngo acting as a fro for the ierests of among others the bill melinda gates foundation citi bank mastercard and visa inc in this light inclusive finance can be seen as the conversion of the unbanked io tax and debt serfs who pay transaction fees and serve as collateral for the financial system financial innovatiohe bis is discussing all sorts of other features all made possible by the idea of programmable my as we will see most of this innovation is in the ierests of ceral banks of the promised benefits of cbdcs is that it can make iernational paymes much more efficie and transpare beca these kinds of liabilities are being built from scratch cbdcs are billed as offering a unique opportunity to facilitate easier cross border paymes lt cbdc design choices_before we coinue it is importa to note that there have been few official decisions made as to how to move forrd the iroduction of a cbdc requires significa work and ceral banks are moving slowly in order not to break anything in this next section we look at the overviews the bis has made on designing cbdcs lots of research has been e across academia financial institutions and the ceral banks and the bis has created a nice summary of the design options it also reveals what the benefits and downsides of these design choices are with this ledge we can then look at the design decisions that have already been made by the ecb and fed and hence conclude what is happening behind the scenes tokens vs ideity basedfirst of all a choice has to be made as to whether the cbdc is to be token based or tied to an ideity through an accou according to the bis it has to be either or the other source bis quarterly review march a token based system would work other crypto currencies those with the private keys can spend the my but the drawbacks according to the bis are severe is the high risk of losing funds if end rs fail to keep their private key secret furthermore it would be challenging to design an effective regulatory framework for such a system law enforceme agencies would run io difficulties when seeking to ideify claim owners or follow my flows just as with cash or bearer securities in addition a token system would nullify the ceral bank objectives discussed above the other option is that the and ownership of a cbdc is accessible through an accou tied to an ideity similar to how the curre banking system operates to make this happen the bis calls for strong ideities for all accou holders where each individual is tied to ideifier across the eire payme system the disadvaages of an accou based system according to a paper of the bis are that you cannot have anonymity vis a vis the ceral bank and there cannot be private peer to peer transactions without an iermediary as is currely possible with cash see graph source bis committee on paymes and market infrastructures cbdcs direct or indirect liabilities the next question should people have an accou directly with the ceral bank or through iermediary financial institutions here the considerations are not just about what is desirable but also what is practically feasible currely ceral banks simply do not have the infrastructure to hold accous for hundreds of millions of citizens in addition there are regulatory obligations such as kyc and customer due diligence that ceral banks do not have the infrastructure and mandates for the most logical outcome would be for ceral banks to the existing financial companies to roll out cbdcs on a more technical level the question then becomes is the cbdc to be a liability on the balance sheet of the ceral bank or on the balance sheet of a financial iermediary with the latter option the cbdc would be an indirect liability of the ceral bank also n as a syhetic cbdc the bis does not this idea ceralized vs deceralizedanother choice needs to be made between using a deceralized settleme system or a ceralized firstly for regulators deceralized does not mean the same thing as it does to the industry they see it as a few regulated eities validating the settleme system moreover regular consensus mechanisms have too much overhead and are too slow for the large number of transactions needed an issue the bis has with a deceralized cbdc is that it means that a deceralized network makes adjustmes to the balance sheet of the ceral bank this increases the risks to the system according to the bis programmability of the main questions a ceral bank has to ask itself is whether it is going to create programmable my what is programmable my the us federal reserve provides a good definition a digital form of my and a mechanism for specifying the automated behavior of that my through a computer program this mechanism is termed programmability in this note across the pond in individual couries within the eu the need for programmable my is being debated however as you will see in the following sections programmability is an esseial part of cbdcs the ecb has even already released an api for institutions to start programming financial stability requiremesthe fact that cbdcs are going to be exchangeable for digital currencies results in some major risks to the financial system after all cbdcs make it easy to pull your my out of a private institution risk and deposit it with the ceral bank no risk if cbdcs could be freely traded the mome rumors spread that a bank is having issues all accou holders will convert their accou balances to cbdcs guaraeed by the ceral bank you could have insta bank runs and collapses in the financial system would happen as quickly as they do in the crypto space in addition adding cbdcs increases the total amou of my in circulation creates even more inflation at a time when people are already having problems paying their bills as a result any cbdc needs a built in mechanism to limit the amou of total cbdc that can be issued and limit how much can be exchanged for digital currency in short a programmable aspect of the cbdc has to come io play we will see later how both the ecb and fed are already committed to using financial stability as an exc to take full corol over how cbdcs can be held charged and exchanged mtary policy of the main activities of ceral banks over the last decade has been trying to manage the economy through mtary policy up uil now these ierveions have not alys been effective in kick starting the economy cbdcs can give the ceral banks when properly designed much more direct tools for implemeing mtary policy privacyprivacy is of the main concerns of regulators or at least it is the main concern for their poteial rs so this issue has to be addressed in the design of the coin it is worth noting that privacy means something differe for ceral bankers and for end rs in the crypto space it means that the technology makes it impossible for any to track your purchases from the poi of view of ceral banks privacy means that the organisations monitoring and facilitating your paymes are under constrais as to what they can and have to do with your data moreover ceral banks compare the privacy of cbdcs with data mining private financial service companies and with transactions being e on public blockchains they argue that in that light public institutions are better at safeguarding privacy for the design of a cbdc a ceral bank has to make a decision as to what level of privacy a coin will have taking io accou that full privacy is considered incompatible with other policy objectives such as kyc and aml compliance as we will see there are strong indications that privacy as it is understood by the crypto industry is not going to be built io the cbdc system ieroperabilityceral banks will have to make certain design choices such as whether foreigners are to be able to hold accous with the ceral bank or if there is to be some sort of exchange facility perhaps similar to what the crypto industry calls an atomic sp a coordinated cbdc design effort could take a clean slate perspective and incorporate cross border payme options right from the start private vs public chainon a final note investors in existing blockchains such as xlm or xrp have been publicly claiming that cbdcs will be built with their chain as the base layer this is simply not going to happen as previously meid cbdcs are liabilities on the balance sheet of the ceral bank there is no y that they are going to base this on an existing blockchain beca it would mean they would have to take full corol over the network now that we understand the differe design choices available we can look behind the scenes at how ceral banks are applying them starting with the ecb lt the digital euro ecb design choices_to understand the process of the creation of the digital euro we have to recap how the eu works this is well described by todd huizinga a former american diplomat to the eu he explains in detail that the eu is run by elites who wish to create an ever closer union regardless of the desires of the populations of individual eu couries as a result the eu has created a culture where policies are preseed as still being debated and subject to democratic principles whilst in fact behind closed doors the direction is being agreed upon in backroom deals the same seems to apply to the eu s cbdc the digital euro the design and building of the digital euro is at an advanced stage while officially nothing has been decided the reality however is that the issuing of the euro and logically also the design of the digital euro is delegated to the european ceral banking system and as you will see in the remainder of this section the digital euro train left the station a long time ago with funding already secured and companies being hired to build the required infrastructure as it stands now legislation is to be finalized in q and only in q will the decision on the digital euro be formally approved note that by then the design will be finished the design choices of the digital euroin the ecb published their report on the digital euro it sees the future euro as a safe digital asset with advanced functionalities and with profound implications for key areas of ceral banking for the broader economic and financial system and ultimately for the life of european citizens the digital euro would be first of all another y to supply euros convertible at par with other forms of the euro a digital euro will be a liability of the eurosystem and therefore by definition risk free ceral bank my programmabilitythe digital euro should keep pace with state of the art technology at all times in order to best address the needs of the market among required attributes are usability convenience speed cost efficiency and programmability it should be made available through fro end solutions throughout the eire euro area and should be ier operable with private payme solutions programmability is going to be required for a number of desired features there are going to be corols on how much my can be exchanged between differe forms of the euro differe ierest rates on differe forms of the euro and limits on what can hold and or transact in crisis situations there will ly be a maximum amou of cbdc which can be held by person at no additional cost in terms of mtary policy the digital euro should be remunerated at ierest rate s that the ceral bank can modify over time and with differe ierest rates applied in differe cases to get an idea of how much digital euros each accou owner is allowed to own before being faced with restrictive measures such as negative ierest rates the dutch ceral bank suggests that euro should be enough for most dutch citizens as it represes moh s living expenses and a financial buffer for unforeseen expenses next to the accou features there is work being e on special payme instructions such as paymes e between machines in short the digital euro is going to be programmable and not in a y that improves financial freedom accou based access and the digital ideitythe bis report taught us that ceral banks can issue a token or an accou based system the ecb indeed discusses both as possible options a pure bearer token system as exemplified by regular crypto currencies would take ay the corol of the ecb thus according to the ecb such a system can only be allowed when both rs are uniquely ideified for emple with biometrics e g fingerpri and iris recognition the accou based system on the other hand would be operated in the same y as the curre banking system this is the preferred system of the ecb where they operate the back end while existing supervised iermediaries operate the fro end as we see shortly financial service providers have already been hired to build this system as we speak the infrastructure for the digital euro is being built along with an eu wide digital id this digital id governed by the eidas regulation aims to help business citizens and public authorities carry out electronic ieractions this digital id will coain your releva data such as name address biometrics driver s licence medical data and will be d to facilitate transactions open bank accous online shopping financial services such as insurance and god s what else this digital id s approved in early december but the cbdc s already being built and funded long before that ceral or deceralized corolthe ecb s report repeats the bis s options of having a deceralized settleme system however the ecb is not going for this model they state that the ceral bank will corol the back end and has corol over all the units that are to be created other possible featuresother design options are discussed such as the possibility for hardre wearables virtual cards with additional features such as shorter expiration date and spending limits and a pan european mercha solution privacy only for low value transactions the above stateme is from a more rece letter by fabio panetta the driving force behind the digital euro according to him the ecb will explore if they can allow some anonymity in the system the ecb is addressing privacy in response to a public consultation where the ecb asked european citizens what they thought of a european cbdc it received an avalanche of negative responses and privacy s the most cited worry but the statemes of the ecb on privacy are coradictory in public officials tout it as an importa feature but if you then look at their most rece iernal preseation on privacy they explain that r anonymity is not a desirable feature as this would make it impossible to corol the amou in circulation and to preve my laundering the truth is that a gradual shift to digital paymes implies less privacy by default the ecb suggests that the digital euro should be designed so that the eurosystem should only be able to see the minimum transaction data however they are settling the transaction and will need to who is paying what to whom it is quite clear that privacy is not built io the system the ecb suggests that some privacy can be allowed for certain low value paymes and offline functionality however higher value transactions would remain subject to standard corols lt programming the european cbdc ecb softre package_on the th of december the ecb published a package for financial iermediaries to start building applications for the digital euro the publication coained cover letters confirming the design choices discussed above but also a softre package with the application programming ierface api a set of defined rules that explain how the computers of banks are to communicate with those of the ceral bank source ecb website digital euro api package this package provides a programming standard for banks and payme providers that serve the general public it allow them to process paymes digitally while the eurosystem settles the paymes the ecb is testing a system where iermediaries get to program differe kinds of transactions five companies have been selected to build softre iegrations on a settleme layer hosted by the ecb each will test a differe type of transaction as an annex to the article can download the code of the actual api from the source code a number of additional conclusions can be drawn about the model currely being pursued the digital euro will have iermediaries deal with clies and the ecb ultimately settling all the transactions the iermediary creates the payme the eurosystem approves and then a callback confirms the details of the transaction with details on the time and date it settled despite the non stop bashing of bitcoin by the ecb the curre proposal s the same technology utxo pub private signatures and even the same security model secpk as bitcoin the ecb is literally creating a bitcoin rip off and may even be re using open source bitcoin code the ecb will respond to every payme request with either settled or failed meaning that it has the ultimate corol over what paymes do and do not get approval it is unclear what conditions would result in a failed payme given the large number of transactions the ecb will have to process and the risk of running complex softre at a settleme layer it is hard to imagine the ecb programming payme conditions for specific cases however running a payme through a sanctions list or a list with basic conditions might be feasible moreover it seems ly that programming features will be enforced at the layers above the settleme layer for emple the ecb is working on a dedicated programmability platform layer between the settleme layer and the iermediary layers source ecb programmable paymes in digital euro the documeation explains how iermediaries create addresses on behalf of their clies it is only this address the ecb sees the more sensitive accou details are kept with the financial service provider this is explained as safeguarding privacy however a permane record of all transactions is stored all the ecb needs to do is match a name to each address and it sees everything it is as of yet unclear how mtary and financial stability objectives are going to be coded io this system it also is not clear how the ecb aims to reconcile the coradiction of limits on accou balance and their privacy goals the latest ecb progress update does not alleviate these worries it states that for online paymes the eurosystem itself will record transactions and perform associated verification tasks and it happens to be that online paymes are the category of paymes with the broadest set of high level cases now ask yourself how large a share of paymes in a digital currency will be e online in any case it is safe to assume there is not going to be real privacy in this system beca with this design either the ceral bank or the iermediary s the ideity of the rs behind each transaction us federal reserve design of the digital dollar_compared to the ecb the american ceral bank the federal reserve is not as far advanced with designing their cbdc however in january the fed did release their report my and paymes the u s dollar in the age of digital transformation in the opening paragraphs the fed repeats the familiar take that cbdcs are a differe kind of my compared to existing forms and states that in their opinion a cbdc is a digital liability of the federal reserve that is widely available to the general public it would be the safest digital asset available to the general public with no associated credit or liquidity risk the report pois to the fact that the federal reserve act does not allow direct federal reserve accous for individuals the fed will therefore have to adopt an iermediary model where the private sector would offer accous or digital s to facilitate the manageme of cbdc holdings and paymes just as with the ecb you will not have an accou directly with the fed but although commercial banks and non banks would offer these services to individuals the cbdc itself would be a liability of the federal reserve further on the fed argues that a future cbdc should be iermediated widely transferable and ideity verified while at the same time being privacy protected these are again coradicting objectives as a case the fed notes that governmes could a cbdc to collect taxes or make benefit paymes directly to citizens additionally a cbdc could poteially be programmed to for emple deliver paymes at certain times again programmable my additionally a cbdc could poteially be d to carry out micro paymes and streamline cross border paymes by using new technologies crucially the fed recaps the risk unlimited of cbdcs poses to the stability of the financial system as such the fed also proposes the variation of ierest rates on differe kinds of my and limits on the amou an end r could hold moreover to preve a flight to safety it proposes limits to the amou a r could accumulate in a short period of time and last but not least the fed discusses its mtary policy and the need to expand its balance sheet to accommodate cbdc growth part of this could be mitigated by shifting ay from existing non reserve liabilities yes the fed is suggesting withdrawing cash to make room for cbdcs new york fed testing of wholesale cbdcsthere were a number of rece headlines reporting that the new york fed had started a week test of their first cdbc however this project is mostly about exploring the concept of a wholesale cbdc this is a form of cbdc that is only d to settle the liabilities of regulated financial institutions although ieresting it does not tell us much about the future of retail cbdcs which are the main subject of this report fednow payme systemfednow is another project under developme by the fed that is sometimes confd with a cbdc this facility will enable individuals and businesses to send insta paymes between accous while the idea of insta settleme reminds us of crypto currency what is settled are not ceral bank liabilities as such fednow is not a cbdc system lt conclusion the cbdc prison being built_ceral banks around the world have started building cbdcs these need to be designed and each design has consequences when looking at the design choices made so far we can see where things are headed and it doesn t look good as of now no formal decisions have been made in the jurisdictions discussed regardless the eu s direction seems clear perhaps the us congress still has a say in the future of my we shall see what we see in the works is a system where small groups of unelected people get to approve all paymes there will be no privacy it has purposefully designed features that corol how much my you can hold and what kind of charges and negative ierest rates apply a system of consta surveillance and the ceralization of sensitive information and then we haven t even talked about all the other policies increasingly being enforced through the financial system such as a personal co budget or other social credit systems the re directing of private resources tords public policy goals blended finance and the exclusions of political undesirables cbdcs replace cash with a kind of my you never legally own you can directly be charged ierest and fees on and cannot spend without permission do you this sources this posts is larger than characters so i removed the footnotes from this post full list of footnotes can be found here download this article in pdffor a pdf version of this article to store or share click tldr cbdcs are liabilities directly with the ceral bank they are a new kind of my next to cash and digital my currely held in private banks the bank of iernational settlemes made an overview of all research io cbdcs it shows that each design has consequences the ecb has chose for a design where iermediaries deal with the clies but the ecb settles all paymes there is no real privacy in the system to ensure financial stability the ecb wishes to maiain corol over accou balances apply variable ierest charges and mtary policy stimulus the digital euro is in a far stage of developme the federal reserve act forces the fed to go through iermediaries as well the digital usd will be programmable and ideity verified to ensure financial stability the fed wishes to maiain corols on ierest charges and maximum accou balances the fed also argues that cbdcs might have to replace cash to maiain a healthy balance sheet the digital usd appears to not be in a far stage of developme , the truth about cbdcs design choices by ecb amp fed analysed both are aiming at tight control over accounts interest and

ethereum,hello guys i m new to the sub but has been writing web off chain back end code for a over a year now i m looking for ethereum coract topics combination that is guaraeed to emit at least eve log or very few but preferably just every block for testing my library code so do you guys of any such coracts thank you if you to why i need eve log it s beca beca the go library i m writing ceers around it being eve log polling building blocks with real time chain reorganization detection and handling baked in to detect chain reorg while only getting information from eve logs i log s block hash and will only fetch block headers for block hashes if there s a reorg and a log disappeared from the block so that s why i need eve log for block hash and not the block header it is now e and will soon be open sourced so i m writing emples for devs of the emples is a single file chain reorg monitor service so i need a coract and topics that would make the emple seems reasonable and cheapest to run hence the question i wouldn t to follow a topic with too many logs just to detect a chain reorg ,ethereum contract that emits event log once every block,1.0,1,1003kt9,auxlinarch,0,2022-12-31 21:01:29,1672520500,1672520501,2022-12-31,21:01:29

ethereum,hi i have this particular case and would to share it so people can recommend any solution besides building the solution myself so here it is i to keep some usdc or busd under a multi sign which requires signatures to spend the funds of signatures but i can see a couple of issues with only having parties and needing signatures to perform anything with any funds in that multi sign first death second separation of the parties involved and a need to return funds to each party death if of the two parties dies during the duration of this trust of funds the remaining party needs to go through and recover the other party's to do anything with the funds which is an annoyance at best separation let's say any of the involved parties to stop putting my io this trust fund again is that the name of this thing and leave with their corresponding share of the my but the other party doesn't to sign anything which freezes the funds uil the dispute is settled and worst case scenario n of the parties does what the other part asks and a judge gets involved to resolve the conflict then some solutions come to mind solving both particular edge cases at the same time involving a third party that plays the role of arbitrator it could be a lawyer who represes both parties but these cost my and you need to trust the lawyer to do the right thing to me what comes to mind is a smart coract is cheaper than a lawyer and you can write if you what you are doing to do the right thing but a smart coract can corol of the funds and do whatever n of m signatures requests right i wonder if a smart coract can be a signer party in a multi sign my reasoning for that is that the n of m smart coract signers corol of the funds if some smarter than the person writing the coract to exploit a bug the attacker won't get anything of value beca he still needs other signers to participate in the hack of the signers in this case okay so the question is there something this out there in ethereum that can be d for cheap and with a froend that won't banish suddenly or do i need to build it myself ,a piggy bank with stablecoins in ethereum using multi signature wallets ,1.0,1,zzlf83,shackra,0,2022-12-31 04:33:31,1672461226,1672461226,2022-12-31,04:33:31

ethereum,in short their post raises an importa issue that affects all optimistic rollups that are based on ieractive verifications such as optimism arbitrum cartesi truebit etc in short although the attack does not compromise the security of the rollups chain it allows a well funded party to delay its finality by coinuously burning collaterals for the duration of the attack this news could have been worrisome since it affects several differe protocols however delay attacks are far from an unsurmouable problem first of all arbitrum itself has announced in their article that they a solution to the problem they have announced a new protocol to be published soon which is already being implemeed on another fro cartesi s coributors have also worked to tackle this delay attack and they have just published a solution to the issue in this article in summary under cartesi s proposal a team of dishst parties with x funds can be defeated in a single dispute by an hst player who is willing to deposit log x funds this makes delay attacks impossible and sibling attacks impractical references delay attacks on rollups offchain labs medium this article digs io the delay attack problem and discusses how it s handled in various versions of the arbitrum rollup protocol this is based on a technical breakthrough from the arbitrum research team that makes all against all challenges feasible and efficie this allows a single hst staker to efficiely defeat an army of attackers who have posted a forest of malicious branching assertions nehab and teixeira arxiv in this paper we propose a practical dispute resolution algorithm by which a single hst competitor can win disputes while spending effort linear on the cost of the computation but only logarithmic on the number of dishst competitors this algorithm is a novel stronger primitive for building permissionless fraud proof protocols which doesn t rely on complex economic inceives to be enforced happy to connect with any who s ierested in a deeper dive ,delay attacks on rollups,1.0,1,zyek01,cartesi,0,2022-12-29 19:50:53,1672343473,1672343474,2022-12-29,19:50:53

ethereum,hi all a little over a week ago i tried to purchase some eth via the top up ierface on the torus website using the moonpay option as you can see in both the drop down menu well as the left sidebar the crypto currency options to choose from with moonpay as preseed on the torus website are eth matic and usdc as this is my first time making such a purchase i s extra thorough in checking every confirmation page email i s preseed with to make sure that the currency selected is eth as i had ed to make sure i didn t accideally purchase matic which made it all the more shocking to me when moonpay seems have se me weth weth sn t even an option to choose from via the methods ierface i d so i fail to see how this could have even been r my error here is the polyscan link to the transaction i submitted a support request on moonpay s website and received no reply after days i did receive an automated email immediately after submitting the support request saying they typically respond within hours excluding holidays etc if you to read it here is the message i submitted to moonpay support along with many of the screenshots in this post no new information i haven t already meid above though so you can probably skip over reading it so after days i se a dm to u moonpaysupport on twitter and got this reply note that s to this day still is my first only crypto currency related transaction i ve ever e with that or any other that is in fact the first crypto i ever had so it s quite literally impossible that i had e anything else in the past with my accou history that s against their terms conditions i have literally never had any crypto currency in my possession ownership uil that weth they seem to have mistakenly se me instead of the eth i had purchased from them with all that said thank you sincerely if you read through this far my questions are am i correct in understanding that i should have received eth and not weth there actually is an issue here right given that u moonpaysupport said this decision is final and we won't be able to provide any further assistance on this matter it seems i have zero course of action to take in regards to getting the eth i paid for from them any recommendations for where i can reliably safely purchase some eth ideally not from an exchange where i need to submit a bunch of documes to open an accou i am canadian credit card has canadian address if that makes a difference my resistance tords submitting documes to open an accou with an exchange isn t beca i am trying to remain anonymous or anything but beca all i right now is enough eth to pay for some gas fees to transfer some nfts out of my torus and opening an accou with an exchange seems so excessive so much work yet here i am typing out this long ass post thank you so much for any help insight any of you can provide ,help please i am confused i bought eth from moonpay but received weth instead i asked support what happened and they responded only by disabling my moonpay account with no specific reason provided amp refuse further communication my questions for this subreddit are at bottom of the post ,1.0,1,zyd0wf,pkennethv,0,2022-12-29 18:52:28,1672339961,1672339962,2022-12-29,18:52:28

ethereum,i have this question in my mind as i hear fear of eth being more ceralized as of the reason being few validators corol majority of staked eth coinbase binance etc as ethereum network being merged to pos many long term hodlers are adding eth to stake them m staked i do notice that there is a strong need for being self validator rather in dec cen pools lido coinbace etc and its not easy rather simple to become validator and stake with eth there fore i have a suggestion or proposal to bring it to ethereum devs try to bring a mobile mini hard drive device preconfigured and could be become single or multiple validator node's with extension to mobile app to corol this device with the size of an iph connects with wifi lan bluetooth usb charging etc reduce collateral limit from eth to eth or less this y more young investors will start there own validator nodes i am not sure if there is any device available but this would bring ethereum network security to be more deceralized this is my opinion and i wish this to happen soon if its not already there ,would there be a time when eth hold stake them self on simple to use device ,1.0,1,zyb6p2,prestigious_owl4418,0,2022-12-29 17:39:06,1672335560,1672335561,2022-12-29,17:39:06

ethereum,i have been ing a lot lately about key manageme and fund recovery it occurred to me that we could create a system that allows us to recover funds from lost keys by signing time bound transactions which can sweep our funds in the eve that we lose access in a nutshell this works by signing a transaction that deploys a coract which sends funds to another address this could be a friend family member or even your exchange and setting time constrais such as not valid before and or not valid after you can also sign many of these transactions with multiple nonce values so that you still have a valid transaction in the eve that you make future transactions since this signed transaction is constrained to the recipie and certain time criteria it is not sensitive and can be stored anywhere including on the cloud as a r you have the power to invalidate the transactions at anytime by either spending the funds or using up all the nonces i have started creating a prototype here let me what you of the concept and how you would improve it merry christmas ,idea how we could create timelocked transaction backups to recover ether from lost keys,1.0,1,zu2vvy,bitman321,0,2022-12-24 05:39:21,1671860376,1671860376,2022-12-24,05:39:21

ethereum,eof is the biggest upgrade in the evm's history coming in the shanghai fork in march eof will completely change how ethereum works here's a summary eip the first upgrade in eof changes how instructions to the evm are structured specifically it establishes a structure where didn t really exist before it splits bytecode io two strings of characters coaining code and the other coaining data this eip also makes it easier to upgrade the evm it creates a system to distinguish new coracts and what features each is using the evm executes each program based on the version of the evm it s released in so new upgrades can be delivered more easily eip this iroduces the concept of code validation specifically when a smart coract is deployed coracts today aren t validated by the ethereum network before they re deployed they get validated as they re executed by people validating coracts upon deployme saves significaly on execution costs programs are validated once upon deployme and any necessary data for operation is made available in the data section of the bytecode eip quick tange stack machines can be imagined as glass coainers tall and thin they execute instructions and store data in these glass coainers the first piece of data is placed at the bottom and everything afterrds gets placed on top in a stack stack machines have poiers that can move between pieces of data to read them the y ethereum shift its poier today is with a jump which requires a destination or a jumpdest eip 's new opcodes enables the ethereum stack machine to shift its poier far more efficiely this results in cheaper gas fees both for deploying a coract as well as for ieracting with it also makes on chain analysis easier eip this iroduces functions that the stack itself can perform functions are instructions that need to be performed more than once in a program writing such instructions once as a function makes programs more efficie leading to cost savings on ethereum currely functions t exist at the bytecode level that the stack machine executes on ethereum to repeat instructions the jump and jumpdest opcodes are instead d to shift the poier to where an instruction is when it needs to be executed eip this eip focs on validating coracts upon deployme but by looking for errors the stack machine might encouer called stack overflows or underflows stack overflow when a stack is out of space stack underflow retrieving data from an empty stackdespite stack overflows and underflows being basic errors they can occur on ethereum today the checks to preve them are iroduced with this eip eof is a suite of eips together making evm execution more efficie more consiste and more easily upgradeable eof itself is first upgrade in the evm's history and can be expected in the shanghai hard fork in march if you'd to learn more read the full write up on my free newsletter below ,a simple explanation of eof evm object format,1.0,1,ztso6h,phillistine,0,2022-12-23 21:07:55,1671829689,1671829690,2022-12-23,21:07:55

ethereum,i am trying to understand sidechains and how they relate to ethereum but all the articles i read keep saying things a sidechain is a separate blockchain that runs independe of ethereum and is connected to ethereum mainnet by a two y bridgethat is from here but i 't get it solana has bridges to ethereum does that make solana a side chain of ethereum polkadot has bridges to ethereum is that also a side chain i mean what makes an ethereum sidechain distinct from other chains that can also have bridges to ethereum also in the article above it is stated that sidechains can have separate block parameters and consensus algorithms which are often designed for efficie processing of transactionsokay so sidechains have some edge over mainchain mainly processing speed if that is the case why then does it need to be connected to the mainchain and acts as a sidechain to the main chain i ask beca it is also stated that the sidechain does not derives it's security from the mainchain so if it does not derive its security from the ethereum mainchain why does it then even have to have a sidechain relationship with the ethereum mainchain can some please help explain thanks,what exactly is the relationship between sidechains and main chain ,1.0,1,zsho4i,finlaydotweber,0,2022-12-22 09:15:49,1671700559,1671700559,2022-12-22,09:15:49

ethereum,i ed to share a thought i had about how putting stocks on the blockchain could help stock exchanges in less liquid markets attract investmes and improve the lives of those in the region and the best part is it could all be e while encouraging transparency and giving liquidity providers a new y to invest in the stock market so what do i mean by less liquid markets these are stock exchanges in regions or couries where there isn't as much trading activity this can make it difficult for companies to raise the capital they need to grow and succeed and it can also make it hard for investors to find good opportunities but by putting stocks on the blockchain these exchanges can poteially attract more investme from around the world the transparency and security of the blockchain can make it easier for investors to feel confide about putting their my io these markets and for the companies listed on these exchanges it can provide a new source of funding and a y to tap io a global investor base but it's not just about attracting more investme by bringing more activity to these exchanges we can also help to improve the lives of those in the region when companies are able to raise the capital they need they can create jobs drive economic growth and coribute to the overall well being of the community and for automatic market maker liquidity providers this could be a fun and exciting new y to invest in the stock market instead of just being limited to the major exchanges they can now poteially access a whole new world of opportunities and help to drive liquidity in these less liquid markets ,putting stocks on the blockchain from less liquid exchanges,1.0,1,zqux41,godking99,0,2022-12-20 17:56:33,1671559007,1671559007,2022-12-20,17:56:33

ethereum,guys i usually get english but this time its all going over my head i what finality means i both finalisation and justification upgrades but the following did not make sense to me finality requires a two thirds agreeme that a block is canonical an attacker cannot possibly create an alternative finalized chain without owning or manipulating two thirds of the total staked ether destroying at least third of the total staked ether the first condition arises beca two thirds of the staked ether is required to finalize a chain the second condition arises beca if two thirds of the total stake has voted in favor of both forks then third must have voted on both double voting is a slashing condition that would be maximally punished and third of the total stake would be destroyed what i understood of total eth staked needs to be vote for upgradation of the concerned block the above al and not even the reasoning or how this voting happens if they ask for finalising justifying x block or is all of that e by only asking which chain is the correct latest blockchain state or what ectly is asked can some please simplify this for me i do not understand anything from the second condition paragraph please explain me that paragraph in simple manner ,short passage to be explained like am ,1.0,1,zo6m4a,benbaldwinjg,0,2022-12-17 13:46:06,1671284780,1671284780,2022-12-17,13:46:06

ethereum,why is a sizable number of people ignoring ethereum dexes in favor of cexes rumors about binance being insolve are floating around ct and regardless of the fact that these rumors are probably just that rumors binance or any other ceralized exchange should have never had this much power over the market binance is technically corolled by a single man cz meaning that person has the power to make or break the crypto market this is far from what vitalik and satoshi planned for satoshi ed to get rid of governme corol over mtary supply and vitalik ed to create an ecosystem that will end up helping us self govern through defi and daos we already have dexs unisp pancakesp and there are ethereum based organizations bitdao investing hundreds of millions of dollars io new dexs apex so there s really no shortage of any sort of deceralized exchanges out there on the market the fact that we re being lazy and purposely relying on ceralized exchanges is the problem this is ectly why exchanges binance pose a huge threat for the market beca in a scenario where it fails though unly the eire market could go down with itstart using dexes instead of cexes,these cexs only hold as much power as we give them ,1.0,1,zleo35,deliciousnectarine8,0,2022-12-14 02:20:18,1670984429,1670984430,2022-12-14,02:20:18

ethereum,hi every i to understand what is the difference between mining and running a node and becoming a validator what requires consensus voting proposing blocks i guess it is selected proposer for every slot but please correct me and tell how this has changed before and after merge or validating blocks if a deceralised project is not running their node by themselves then isn t it nonsense clie diversity is emphasised much but still geth and prysm nethermind are majorly d clies making this again not secure with single poi of failure which all of this s created for also if this has to do with time that over time there will be diverse options with n dominating then is it practically possible to do so as the best r experience will be best by eity at any given time not a question but please correct me if i am wrong execution layer is the where new txns are shared executed on blockchain and state is updated consensus layer is the where consensus happens with now p o s which checks if data is valid to make immutable changes or not so doesn t this mean consensus layer works put to work first and then execution layer please simplify this for me a bit ,some questions for the wise redditors here,1.0,1,zl43my,benbaldwinjg,0,2022-12-13 19:13:44,1670958841,1670958842,2022-12-13,19:13:44

ethereum,ls have made major gains in the rece year and have developed new tech and upped their throughput ethereum as well has pushing io upgrading the chain in a y that boosts l throughput dank sharding tords the end of however regardless of how fast a chain l can process transactions there will alys be the issue of dependencies what are dependencies dependencies are the result of blockchains and in extension ls processing transactions in a sequeial manner dependency is when every transaction relies on the before it in order for it to get executed this means that while a blockchain l might have great processing power all of that power is being focd on transaction at a time regardless of how significa said transaction really is this put a massive restrai on the capabilities that a blockchain l is capable of performing of it as you buying a new packaging machine for your factory this packaging machine has slots to handle multiple packages at the same time however your factory only has conveyor belt meaning so you can technically work packages at a time but practically you re restrained by the sequeial order you re forced to follow how are ls trying to solve this issue y of solving this issue is implemeing a parallel evm engine aptos labs developed a block stm engine and to make it short and uncomplicated for the average reader what this does is it executes a bunch of transactions in parallel it does that under the assumption that n of the transactions conflict l polygon adopted a similar approach to their evm in order to scale ethereum but it came with its own set of complications beca polygon processes a massive volume of transactions the system that aptos came up with won't work beca in a hugely adopted system the polygon pos acting as if there were no dependencies anywhere in any block won t work it would be taking a theoretical idea too farwhat polygon did instead s write transactions in a data structure called dag if you you can expand your ledge on this but in order to save time and not make things complicated what this does is take dependencies io consideration and then execute transactions before validating so that the metadata with deduced dependencies can be easily executed what does this mean for ethereum while there still aren t any parallel evm chains right now as we saw certain ls polygon are working on developing and hopefully this pushes other ls to follow suitthis is definitely an added value for ethereum in ethereum s new roadmap the chain will rely solely on ls for scalability so this will be major news considering that a developme this will most ly double the throughput that any l is currely putting out all of which will benefit ethereum since its main issue has alys been scalability restrais ,here s how ls are planning on moving from fast to even faster ,1.0,1,zejwnz,pihip2,0,2022-12-06 22:18:08,1670365103,1670365104,2022-12-06,22:18:08

ethereum,hey every i had an idea for a pp exchange bisq for uk and eu but s open banking ob to get around many of the shortcomings that bisq has i to get feedback on this preamble recely you may or may not that stripe released its own r in the us as has moonpay etc i ve d the moonpay a few times to buy small amous of eth for quick tests when i t to my main on a transaction i s charged and stripe also takes a ridiculous cut obviously its possible to go through cexs but its not easy to iegrate a low fee r oo a defi website and from a cex and people dis cex s for a variety of good reasons it s incredibly frustrating seeing large fees or complex processes to get tokens io my from fiat bisq has two major flaws in my opinion besides the fact its in the us im from the uk which i would say is more forrd facing on the fiech side there is little corol over order sizes its not super liquid the payme methods are dodgy on the fiat side most importaly require proof of transaction which is difficulti propose an exchange that combines bisq s framework with open banking and some inspiration from unisp that should allow virtually free pp trustless flexible ring a seller puts their erc token in a liquidity pool smart coract and signs a hash with the block number which is communicated to the buyer a buyer eers the amou they wish to buy and the price is determined by an amm or gets the spot prices from unisp binance an algorithm figures out every they need to pay and generates a qr to pay every you can bank transfer multiple people at the same time in the uk for free and instaly using ob called pisp the hash is in the reference hashed with the buyer address an algorithm scans the sellers data to look for the hash and once it is there s the hash to unlock the coract using some zk proof and can generate the address from the signed hash of the seller or scans the buyers bank data to ensure the transaction has been made once the coract receives this proof it sends the buyer address the stored token this is the simple version i ve thought alot about the associated problems including being unable to verify accou data etc to what exte does this rely on a ceralized eity etc the conclusion i ve reached is that this should feels completely seamless for the buyer thanks to open banking i e scanning qr code i believe in ieroperability not competition between good cefi innovations and defi it is completely non custodial at all stages there is actually no cost in this eire process except that of transferring the tokens to sell to a coract i the concept of liquidity providers earning some fee as on unisp can fix poteial liquidity problems grateful for any feedback ,idea for pp exchange that runs faster and more smoothly than a cex,1.0,1,zds8t7,bm13131,0,2022-12-06 02:25:07,1670293517,1670293518,2022-12-06,02:25:07

ethereum,i have my crypto directly on the blockchain in my custody with a key and ledger and i've been trying investing in ethereum via etfs i never exchanges and generally agree with the saying not your key not your crypto however here in canada there have been some institutional etf securities invested in ethereum bitcoin that are supposedly protected that i'm curious about mainly by purpose investmes so these ethereum etfs are institutional securities on the toroo stock exchange tsx and are held in trust and supposedly protected they cannot be le out or abd exchanges have been doing i have read quite a bit about these and i invest in lots of etfs and would prefer to invest in crypto through etfs rather than have to hide pass keys around my ho and mess with ledgers etc i recely read though that purpose keeps the crypto with gemini in cold storage via their trust company and they are separate from gemini's earn business who is currely having the liquidity crunch and halted withdrals gemini claims that their lending business is completely separate from their institutional custody business which they claim is supposedly safe from this whole ftx mess beca it's held in trust and regulated by banking law etc supposedly if gemini dies the securities would be returned to me if the company isn't bought by another any other stock or etf i ed to ask here how buproof their claim actually is though seeing how much b s has been floating around by all of these crypto companies lately ,institutional crypto etfs vs custodial ethereum,1.0,1,z2vwnm,physical_charge_772,0,2022-11-23 18:01:16,1669226488,1669818857,2022-11-23,18:01:16

ethereum,a mining pool is a joi group of cryptocurrency miners who combine their computational resources over a network to strenhen the probability of finding a block or otherwise successfully mining for cryptocurrency there are differe shades of mining a miner can mine by self though she would receive all the rerds without having to pay any else the approach is usually impractical in reality for casual miners with a mining rig or two the difficulty in popular blockchains ethereum has become so high that finding a block would take years joining a mining pool a miner could join a mining pool by adding her hash power to the power of the group when any in the pool finds a valid block the rerd is shared among the miners proportional to the work they have submitted joining a cloud mining instead of owning the hardre required to mine herself either individually or in a pool the miner could re time from existing miners who operate the hardre ,mining pool,1.0,1,z2l4s1,classic-register6841,0,2022-11-23 09:58:09,1669197500,1669818958,2022-11-23,09:58:09

ethereum,i remember how vitalik once meid that the main goal behind ethereum is to help humanity and society become more self relia and eveually escape the grasps of tyrannical figures and institutions and while this still might be far from happening it is the end goal that all of us as a community are working to eveually achieve it will take time but the goal is there if fact we re already seeing deceralized organizations helping out the people who need self governance the most many people living in certain african and asian couries are under the full corol of corrupt tyrannical governmes and institutions and thus ethereum and ethereum based deceralized projects can be the most effective there this is very evide by the fact that the mena region has registered the highest crypto market growth in plus there are some ethereum based organizations bitdao that are funding subdaos africadao to help boost adoption in african regions and give the people there a taste of well needed self governance this is all very revolutionary but again this moveme is still in its infancy but it s progress ntheless everything needs to start somewhere right all i really care about is seeing ethereum and all the projects and dapps built on it actually get utilized in the real world and not just that they re being utilized in a y that might end up improving the y of life for hundreds of millions of people eveually so i m all in for this hopefully i can witness this moveme completely unfold in my lifetime ,ethereum based daos are helping boost adoption and utilize crypto in regions like africa and asia this is exactly what ethereum was created for,1.0,1,ywk8r4,glittering_item_3818,0,2022-11-16 04:56:18,1668574592,1669821158,2022-11-16,04:56:18

ethereum,i have a question tornado cashe s sanctid by ofac however if you look at the etherscan from to does not appear but it is often indicated as rail railgun side says they are legal on their official website the reason is that if the s requests the disclosure of transaction information you can submit the information in response so there is no problem this is where my curiosity arises the s has obtained information that the colombian mafia s railgun to launder funds however through etherscan al it is not possible to who the mafia is so when kim jong un heard that the s s in a state of panic he s delighted he paid any in iran through railgun to buy the equipme needed to build a nuclear bomb kim jong un tipped putin and xi jinping off about his success then the pair too happily settled the arms import and export funds needed for the ukrainian r through railgun in this case the s will come to a boil eveually the s will require all railgun rs to disclose txs' information doesn't this mean that the railgun's privacy protection is meaningless after all if you transfer coins through tornado cache and disclose all information to the s there is practically no difference between these two methods right after all wouldn't railgun be subject to sanctions just tornado cash ,is railgun legal ,1.0,1,yvu1t0,gotificial,0,2022-11-15 11:08:11,1668510507,1669821443,2022-11-15,11:08:11

ethereum,according to coinmarketcap the world now has nearly cryptocurrencies this makes determining which s will be profitable in the long run difficult for investors but my personal favorite is ethereum which is also the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization there are numerous advaages such as nfts beca ethereum is the major blockchain where most of the top n nonfungible tokens are launched people are excited about ethereum beca the market for nfts is expected to reach more than billion in sales by with a perce annual growth rate this suggests that ethereum will be in high demand beca it is required to pay fees when producing or purchasing tokens on deceralized platforms opensea nfts can now be d to accomplish a wide range of tasks as we all nfts offer some people the opportunity to make large sums of my however only some people who deal with them become a millionaire every is unique and every's risk rerd tolerance varies as a result depending on 's perspective nfts can be viewed as either a lottery or an investme in some cases regarding nfts in lottery systems the lottery industry accous for of global gambling revenue this type of gaming is rumored to be coming soon to platforms billionair which is powered by a robust token based economy the airb utility token and nft based tickets these can be d to participate in raffles bet ger on and win the best skill and chance games the crypto scene evolves so quickly there are more and more opportunities for ethereum and nft holders what is the most significa advaage of ethereum in your opinion ,what do you consider the biggest advantage of ethereum ,1.0,1,yud14k,the_phallus_of_joy,0,2022-11-13 20:25:43,1668371156,1669821987,2022-11-13,20:25:43

ethereum,did you ever about how people decide on nft prices or how you price nfts i've been wondering how some nfts make my when they sell for as little as and people pay exorbita fees that's why i've been ing about this question markets for nfts began to gain traction in and by the end of march this new market for digital assets had a total lifetime traded volume of approximately million some of the frequely asked questions are how does price their art and what is the best strategy for selling nfts despite the lack of predefined pricing strategies for nonfungible tokens nft sellers may choose to sell them at the listing price in a secondary market alternatively they may complete the sale at a price that a buyer is willing to pay referred to as the buyer price beca of this gaming nfts are the easiest to deal with nfts can be rerded with battle gameplay armor weapons or who s what as in m tournames as you can see i'm more ierested in gaming nfts so i'm not sure how pricing works for differe types of nfts even so i believe that if you set your price too high you risk never being able to sell that item and that if you set your price too low gradually raising it will be more difficult what are your opinions ,i've been wondering how some nfts make money when they sell for as little as and people pay exorbitant fees,1.0,1,yubpt6,finley_dz,0,2022-11-13 19:41:30,1668368503,1669822002,2022-11-13,19:41:30

ethereum, definitiohe blockchain is operated based on a plurality of nodes configured in a pp method couless transactions are submitted mome by mome from clies all over the world tords couless nodes spread all over the world the results of these transactions are recorded on all nodes and in particular the coes should be the same overall in order to realize this the rule that all nodes must follow is the consensus algorithm to describe it more conceptually it can be defined as a method in which a specific node is selected by a certain rule especially by the deceralization principle the selection and execution order of transactions is determined by the selected node and other good willed nodes independely verify and execute the coes of individual transactions and store them in their database as such consensus algorithms can be clearly defined however many people are misunderstanding this definition the subject of consensusthere is a serious misunderstanding about it of the general public misunderstands this poi and most of the dapp programmers who have not built the mainnet themselves are misunderstood or ambiguous this is even shown on ethereum's official website there is no understanding of the definition of the consensus algorithm meid above or it is ambiguous the fundameal ca of this problem is the illusion about the subject of consensus in short even though the coe of the transaction that's the autheicity of the author is not a subject of consensus it is often mistaken the only subjects of the consensus are the selection of transactions and the order in which they are implemeed a the coes of the transaction ectly the autheicity of the author the transaction that a sends eth to b is electronically signed with a private key and deployed to the blockchain network the autheicity of the transaction creator is judged by each of all pp nodes it doesn't get help from any outside and it doesn't ask any outside however most ordinary people and surprisingly many dapp programmers mistake the autheicity of the coe or the author's autheicity as the subject of consensus however this is not the subject of consensus but of ai consensus a famous pharase about this is the following do not trust verify as a result even if all other nodes in ethereum conspired to forge the transaction and store it in the database the hst node does not care about it at all and verifies the transaction by itself and stores it in its own database and new nodes joining afterrds will follow the hst node b selection and execution order of transactionsthese are the genuine subjects of consensus no more no less not all transactions submitted to the blockchain are selected and the selected transactions are not executed in the order in which they are submitted this is beca it is theoretically impossible as long as the concept of a block of finite capacity is premised therefore there arises a problem of deciding how many transactions to accept in block and in what order to execute them it is the problem of the consensus algorithm and in itself this becomes the definition of it i selection of transactionsfor emple assuming that suddenly billion transactions are pushed in second it becomes impossible to put them in block therefore we have no choice but to choose some of them in this case most mainnets collect transactions in the order of high gas prices and put them in blocks therefore even transactions submitted first in time may not be included in the block if the gas price is low they also run later than other transactions with high gas prices even if they are coained in blocks for reference the existing ceralized system solves this problem by creating a queue so even if a billion transactions suddenly hit in a second it can theoretically accept and process the whole transactions ii order of execution of transactionsthis is also usually determined based on gas prices maybe all the mainnets are doing that and i've never heard of that exception in this case it is natural that the possibility of manipulation occurs the answers of existing blockchain protocols to this are as follows code is law it means that you are responsible for not checking the law in advance this is simply an irresponsible attitude for emple if an incompete legislator incorrectly eered the amou of parking fines and added another zero the legislator is not at fault and you are an idiot for not checking the law this is the curre state of the blockchain in the dao crisis the law s eveually forced to be revised now it should be law is code the order of execution of transactions must be in the order in which they were submitted at least they should try to do that however the existing mainstream platforms insist that the curre gas price auction system is the right y offering only poor excs of course every s that it is a lazism the birth of the block conceptas described above the curre consensus algorithms have a fundameal problem nevertheless the reason satoshi and buterin adopted this method s to make ceralized manipulation impossible in the selection and execution order of transactions that's they sacrificed the general principle of pre submissionism to pursue deceralization by the y in order to pursue deceralization in the satoshi sense the order of selection and execution of transactions must be determined by a node rather than a specific node however if couless clies submit their transactions to a myriad of nodes the unity of the overall database will be broken if the transactions are executed in the order submitted for each node therefore he s forced to seek ys to select and order transactions by any random node and to allow other nodes to accept them to this end it is needed to establish rules on who will make decisions on selection and who will follow them as selected by a duly elected selection decision maker other nodes follow it and execute each transaction and store it in their own database thereby maiaining the overall database uniformity it s the pow that satoshi came up with as a y to determine who has the authority to make the above selection decision that means that the person who solves the high level math problem the fastest will be given the right to decide on the selection of transactions however in order to do this you need time to solve math problems and during that period the transaction queue is accumulated at this poi satoshi came up with the concept of the very block it is the miner who succeeds in solving the math problem satoshi established a rule that the miner selects all or some of the transactions accumulated during the period of solving mathematical problems puts them in block and executes them and all other nodes follow the rules the block concept of blockchain s born in this coext limitations of the meaning of deceralization in blockchainas such the block concept emerged as a methodical eleme to make it impossible to manipulate in the adoption and order of execution of transactions it s the best y within the limits of satoshi's ielligence the reason satoshi adopted the block concept s of course to achieve the idea of deceralization despite innumerable problems such as the execution delay of transactions during the block generation time the reversal of the transaction execution order and uncertaiy of being selected in the block satoshi believed that deceralization would be guaraeed if a node s selected from among the innumerable good willed nodes spread around the world and those nodes determined the selection and execution order of transactions and he thought that if only the deceralization s guaraeed he could endure a number of problems cad by block generation if so it is necessary to calmly emine the advaages of the deceralization compared to the ceralization system at the expense of such considerable costs for this it is good to make a comparison in other words it is assumed that there is ceralized node and that this node determines the selection and execution order of transactions and other nodes follow suit next the deceralization system is compared with this first there is no difference in the coe of the transaction whether it is a ceralization method or a deceralization method this is beca forgery is impossible thus the transaction in which a transfers bitcoin to b works ectly the same on these two systems and is also stored in the database in the same y it is also impossible for the ceralization system operator to produce the above manipulated transaction from the beginning and both systems are the same in this respect however there are differences between the two systems in the selection of transactions and in determining the order of execution the problem is that it is necessary to emine whether the difference is esseial or relative speaking from the conclusion the difference is only a relative difference and in particular in terms of fairness that is preveion of manipulation it can be said that there is nothing better than a ceralized system in a deceralized system let's look at this in detail the manager x of the ceralized system can arbitrarily manipulate the selection and execution order of the first transaction in which a transfers bitcoin to b and the second transaction in which a transfers bitcoin to c so if x hates b loves c and a's curre balance is bitcoin x can make the bitcoin which is normal to be transferred to b be transferred to c by manipulating the order of transactions or omitting the first transaction at all satoshi s are of the above problems and as a couermeasure he studied how to empower random node operators to decide the selection and order of execution of transactions the result of the study s mining and the concept that arose as an inevitable result of the mining s the block finally at first it seemed that satoshi's idea could be realized without obstacles if there are innumerable nodes and an arbitrary or random node operator determines the selection and execution order of the transaction it can be admitted that virtually no can manipulate it however the reality did not go as satoshi thought the first typical situation s the emergence of the mining king in china he s able to exert the power of the operator of a ceralized node to some exte based on the enormous hash power and most of all the critical scene s the dao incide ethereum foundation and a series of sympathizers have artificially manipulated the selection and execution order of the transactions to generate an artificial fork since then couless artificial forks have been implemeed in the blockchain ecosystem as a result satoshi's logic of deceralization has virtually collapsed as an inevitable result the block concept has now fallen io a relative rather than an absolute concept in the blockchain in fact even if it s not the chinese mining king or the dao crisis there s alys a possibility of manipulation by arbitrary node operators that is the case when a node operator is preparing to manipulate at that time in case he succeeds in mining if he prepares manipulated codes and allows the codes to be executed when he succeeds in mining or is selected as a validator he can manipulate them for emple with simple code manipulation it is possible to change the selection and order of execution of transactions in a low rather than high order of gas prices as such deceralization through mining and blocks s originally an incomplete method it s not a digital but an analog concept that is on a differe level from the absolute concept of the impossibility of forgery by electronic signature and this result applies equally to pos whether the stake is large or small a node operator can manipulate the selection and execution order of transactions as long as he is selected as a validator but the problems 't end here it's time to ask a more fundameal question is it reasonable to fundameally determine the selection and order of execution of transactions based on gas prices to say the conclusion in advance it is a manipulation in itself it's nothing more and nothing less than to benefit some who has offered more bribes let's look at it in detail in general it is right to execute the transaction received first for emple no matter how much remittance fees are offered to a bank it never changes the remittance order beca it is a principle of nature to process remittances in chronological order there is no reason to treat this principle differely in blockchain therefore if the order is to be reversed a corresponding unavoidable reason must be preseed satoshi's answer to this is as follows by extracting transactions in the order of higher gas prices the platform can preve infinite repetitive attacks this is not a reasonable preseation this is a simple security issue and a topic unrelated to deceralization that's it is not an issue to be considered in the stage of building the core of the blockchain that should be considered once the esseial structure of the blockchain is completed in other words in the core stage it is right to complete the basic structure so that the transactions are executed in chronological order therefore the infinite repetition attack problem should be considered in the process of considering various secondary problems of the basic structure that has been completed primarily in the process it is the right programming mindset to devise and install a new appropriate additional device separately also such a device is easily conceivable for emple you can find a lot of great methods even at the level of common sense such as conducting transactions in chronological order receiving costs in terms of security rather than gas and returning them if there are no problems later unfortunately it is assumed that satoshi did not have time to come up with such an idea as a result the gas costs were forcibly inserted io the core part of the blockchain under the wrong name that's the security costs were inserted under the name of gas costs the aftereffects of satoshi's decision on subseque blockchains were severe in conclusion satoshi's deceralized method could not achieve its original purpose the selection and execution order of transactions could be manipulated and more fundameally determining them based on the gas prices is just manipulation in itself the gas cost priority policy is an unusual manipulation against the common sense that the transaction received first should be implemeed first and the reason for that manipulation s also poor in conclusion it is inevitable to raise fundameal questions about satoshi's deceralization method that is the block method itself this is not just an issue for bitcoin but a problem for ethereum and all other blockchains disappearance of the blockif all transactions can coinue from beginning to end without manipulation and the database can be stored equally on all nodes the purpose of the blockchain is achieved a curious result emerges here that is the fact that the concept of a block is not necessary to achieve that purpose in addition the fact that n of the existing blockchains achieved the esseial purpose of the blockchains meid above perfectly at least satisfactorily makes us surprised that means that the block is a failed concept as shown by the comparison of the two systems above it cannot be guaraeed that the deceralized pp system of satoshi or ethereum has special advaages over the ceralized pp system instead by adopting a ceralized system but strenhening the devices that corol the ceral main node to preve ab of authority it is possible to make a more fair and unmanipulatable system than the existing deceralized system for emple a main node temporarily monopolizes the selection and execution of transactions and is forced to select and execute transactions in chronological order then the other nodes monitor it constaly and if it operates against principles disqualify it and appoi of the other standby nodes as the main node in any case both ceralized pp and deceralized pp cannot manipulate the coes of a transaction that's both methods already have solved the byzaine general problem the remaining issues are of what to select and how to set execution order but rather a ceralized system can operate them more fairly the transaction submited first is executed first and the gas costs may not be received at last we come to a final conclusion the concept of the block is removed as long as the transactions are executed in the order submitted there is no reason to divide and put them in blocks this is no differe from executing transactions in chronological order received by banks or credit card companies they no longer need the concept of blocks the concept of the block s only satoshi's desperate measure and it is by no means a logically necessary concept to achieve the purpose of the block chain and the most importa fact is that it is desirable to remove the concept of a block as much as possible therefore it comes to the conclusion that the block concept will eveually disappear the only thing that remains is the transaction chain now the blockchain must be renamed the transaction chain which will revolutionize the blockchain ecosystem the appearance of nonblockchainat least it is possible to remove the concept of blocks while maiaining the curre level of fairness of deceralization in bitcoin or ethereum more precisely it means that there are theoretically infinite ys to eliminate the concept of the block to improve the selection and execution order of transactions while securing fairness beyond the curre level of the fairness of deceralization in bitcoin or ethereum then what will the consensus algorithm look if the block concept is actually removed first of all the chain is made up of only transactions this transaction chain also has no fear of forgery at least in the coe of the transaction as long as pp is the premise there is no fear of forgery or falsification of the coes of a transaction whether it is on a ceralized or deceralized system if so the only thing left is the selection and order of transactions who will decide them this means going back to the poi when satoshi created bitcoin based on experience over the past years satoshi has failed on this issue for now therefore we must return to satoshi's initial starting poi even if we 't that and we have to start over from scratch what needs to be observed here is thing and that is enough that's the level of fairness must be above the curre level of bitcoin or ethereum complete fairness is impossible it's not impossible in theory but it's practically impossible unless an innovative new technology rsa emerges the easiest thing to about is appoiing a main node in appoiing the main node the status may be endowed permanely or only temporarily the most appropriate answer will be somewhere in the middle of the two it is virtually impossible to appoi and replace the main node only temporarily i e only once for each transaction satoshi s confroed with this very problem at that time satoshi imagined the concept of block and from this blockchain s born and years later it s confirmed that the concept of block s a failure in this case the most common sense that can be thought of is to appoi a main node under a certain standard and constaly monitor it as a method you may the platform's own code or you may a smartcoract and if manipulation or laziness of the main node is detected a method of replacing the main node automatically or by poll is iroduced even at this level the fairness is not inferior to the former chinese mining king or specific foundation led artificial fork creation above all this method has the advaage of being able to set the operating standards in advance in a smartcoract as a result arbitrary fork generation is fundameally blocked this is beca the fork generation principle itself that other nodes follow the longest blockchain has been removed then it can be said that it is relatively more fair than the existing deceralization system in the end that can be called proof of democracy pod deceralization which is less fair than pod is no longer deceralized eveually the religion of deceralization also collapses many people still believe in this myth it is superstition beca there is no technical basis the trustlessness has a technical basis called a electronic signature however there is no such definite technique for the permissionlessness an esseial eleme of deceralization as demonstrated above the block failed the deceralization has failed in both theoretical and practical ys therefore in this situation calling for deceralization is nothing more than calling for it as a simple ideology it is no more than a cry for th ceury anarchism deceralization without technical support is nothing more than a mere cry of ideology in reality pow and pos are also fundameally operated under the corol of pod they are no longer deceralized things let's look more specifically pow is not a mining certification method but a mining manipulation method as can be seen from china's mining king pos is also only a method that can be manipulated by stakeholders there is currely no technology or method to preve the manipulations the dao crisis and the numerous forks that have been conveniely attempted since then only prove that the blockchain is accepting democracy its ultimate bastion that is it may be seen that the pow or pos is only a kind of pod at prese in other words all existing consensus algorithms are pods pure deceralization independe of democracy does not currely exist therefore the method of selection and ordering of transactions can only be explored based on pod at prese advaages of nonblockchain satoshi's block ended in failure however it has since become the standard for all blockchains most blockchains fundameally do not deviate from satoshi's basic framework eveually all of them disappear or remain only for mum personally bitcoin's block will survive forever on the other hand ethereum is very unstable there is absolutely no reason to maiain the block concept in the ethereum c ethereum's attempt to maiain the curre block concept is an obvious long term impossibility nonblockchain has many advaages once you can stick to the principle that is transactions may be executed in the order of reception or submission as in the previous emple if the tree method with the main node as the top is applied transactions can be executed in the order received by the main node furthermore all transactions can be accepted without omission this is the same as the queue concept in a general computer os there is nothing special the nonblockchain would normally adopt a tree structure of course in preliminary the horizoal pp method of the curre blockchain may be adopted as an auxiliary method it depends on the mainnet developer's choice anyy if the tree structure is adopted it can boast the fastest speed theoretically there can no longer be a rapid structure the nonblockchain does not require a concept such as gas price to determine eligibility to be included in a block beca the concept of a block does not exist in the first place it is enough to accept and impleme in fact the gas costs of existing blockchains are virtually irreleva to the node's operating costs this is beca the execution of transactions and the storage of data are performed in all nodes but the gas costs are only probabilistically paid to miners or validators to be ect gas costs should be distributed fairly to all nodes in this respect the existing gas cost system is extremely unreasonable instead it is desirable to institutionalize a separate method of payme of operating expenses newly and that is possible but that will not be specifically meid here the real purpose of existing blockchains collecting gas costs is not for operating expenses the mining rerds are sufficie to pay operating expenses in fact the real purpose of the gas costs s security costs this is being confessed by ethereum's official site in short gas fees help keep the ethereum network secure by requiring a fee for every computation executed on the network we preve bad actors from spamming the network the nonblockchain collects security costs not gas costs if malicious ie is not positively recognized due to the review the collected gas costs will be returned in this y the security cost may be set high enough without resistance eveually by returning the gas costs they become zero as described above the advaages of the nonblockchain are considerable and there are no theoretical or practical obstacles to its adoption so of course the existing block concept must be discarded and a system consisting only of a pure transaction chain will inevitably emerge the nonblockchain consensus algorithm is bound to be pod for the time being for now we have no choice but to it for the emergence of consensus algorithms that can achieve deceralization in the true sense by a genius who will appear someday uil then it will only be in the form of a pod conclusiohe block s just satoshi's impromptu idea the necessity for hashes to be coiguous is only between transactions not between blocks as a result the name of the blockchain itself is meaningless the blockchain is only method proposed by satoshi to realize the ideology of the transactionchain the block is not the truth the block concept s only of the myriad ys to realize the transactionchain and it has now reached the poi of disposal the byzaine general problem s not solved by satoshi but s just a problem that had already been solved by cryptography it s the electronic signature looking inside the blockchain at the curre stage there are no particularly remarkable technologies other than the electronic signature other technologies are only those that have already existed or can be developed by ordinary programmers it is absurd to try to achieve deceralization with only such poor equipme in other words the crypto world at this stage does not have the ability to realize the ideals of blockchain as an inevitable result the consensus algorithm cannot go beyond pod this is the reality of today's blockchain but the spirit of commercialism s to hide these limitations on the other hand glorify the block to this end they feature the emperor's new clothes the represeative clothes are ethereum's future plans the complexity of this plan is indescribable the complexity s all cad by the concept of the block these are temporary complications that will all disappear when the block concept is removed or at least a fundameal platform that heals the problems appears for the time being of course they are successful in dazzling people ,the fictitiousness of the consensus algorithm the failure of decentralization and the emergence of nonblockchain the content is very long pre scrolling is recommended

ethereum,ethereum is a public ledger and by its design it s mea to be transpare however there is confusion about it being anonymous beca many people still believe that the blockchain in general is anonymous which is false anything can be tracked on the ledger including the details of every transaction and deal you ve made since you started trading it may not be a big deal to some especially to those who t understand that their personal privacy can easily be violated as a result of this people are starting to realize that there is a big privacy gap in crypto this has been lified by the disturbing push for the adoption of cbdcs by the governme which will give them some level of corol over the finances of the general masses zero ledge proofs have been cited by many to be revolutionary especially when it comes to building privacy tools zkps are encryption schemes in which a party who is a prover proves their case of truth concerning specific data on the other party a verifier without revealing the information here are few of the projects that have worked around the technology to build an importa utility privacy in crypto aztec offers rs privacy utilizing layer solutions specifically the zk rollups system rs send transaction requests to aztec and the transactions are then put io a batch and rolled up with other rs' transactions which can lead to a longer processing time but has privacy baked in at a base layer railgun is a privacy preserving smart coract developed on ethereum and s zk snarks to obfuscate transaction details and make anonymous transactions of any erc tokens or erc tokens rs also get privacy at rest meaning they can keep a private balance which sn t possible on previous l privacy protocols it works by removing all ideifying information from transactions it s similar to a metamask or any other just with privacy preserving zk snarks in place zether is a confideial transaction amous are hidden and anonymous transaction sender and receiver are hidden payme mechanism on blockchains with an accou model ethereum it is implemeed as a smart coract called zsc of the major limitations that zether is n for is that transactions get processed at the end of a curre epoch inferring that it can be quite difficult on a busy network however it is quite promising and has everything it takes to be among the major players in private crypto overtime i believe that there are many other ys to keep a private balance on ethereum as a privacy maxi i would love to hear this subreddit s thoughts on what s out there in this area a time will come when privacy will become a big word in crypto and we ll have the bulk of crypto rs keeping their on chain activities private ,zero knowledge proofs application in ethereum,1.0,1,yra2jk,jacobsendy,0,2022-11-10 09:25:37,1668072348,1669823101,2022-11-10,09:25:37

ethereum,is there any legal guidance available for us solo staking validators needing to censor ofac blacklisted ethereum addresses my understanding is there is no y to do this in the default vanilla configuration instead you would need to third party softre by flashbots called mev boost and then select relayers that state they will be censoring ofac blacklisted addresses i am unable to find much in the y of formal legal guidance re this obligation there is some factual evidence for us based validators not needing to censor ofac transaction but they are all circumstaial such evidence includes few if any bitcoin miners currely censor ofac transactions ethereum miners prior to pos mostly did not censor ofac transactions the only exception to this s ethermine and they did not start censoring ofac transactions uil after tornado cash s added a few weeks prior to the merge there is no indication they censored before tornado cash s added to the ofac list even now many large us based validators are running vanilla configuration without censoring such as coinbase kraken and staked us persumably they would not do so if they thought this s against ofac regulations i am wondering if any has any access to any real legal analysis in this regard my concern would be treasury ofac is a dept of the treasury would be more ly to target solo validators to make an emple out of them since they would not have the resoucres to defend themselves than a large exchange or other ceralized eity such as coinbase or kraken then they could any settleme or conviction as precede to then go after the larger ceralized actors ,legal guidance for us ethereum stakers re ofac compliance,1.0,1,ynj33r,stablerare,0,2022-11-06 06:51:37,1667717510,1669824459,2022-11-06,06:51:37

ethereum,the clash card is a pve strategy card based battle game inspired by mediaeval r cultures the game revolves around rival encouers in differe forts where the commanders align their combat personals in differe manners by strategy to launch an attack or defense depending on their cards the core challenge of the game is the design and arrangeme of the deck the clash cards game is launched on the bnb smart chain to ensure lower gas fee and higher scalability that is inhere to the bnb chain the game is a deceralized version of the ceralized game clash royal inspired by the latter the former is designed on the blockchain network to add higher security immutability and play to earn mechanics the blockchain based clash cards is purely an inceive based game where your rerds and earnings can be easily converted io crypto assets not only the game mechanics driven by the clash tokens but the cards in the game are also nfts developed on the erc token standard blockchain based gaming by utilizing blockchain technology all in game assets are the player s sole and eternal property beca of the security and transparency that blockchain technology provides for their data players can have more confidence when playing games in a deceralized system players require a certain degree of discretion given that blockchain technology is based on a distributed ledger the deceralized nodes connected to a blockchain network can create permane storage for the deceralized gaming environmes beca the records are stored on chain players can replay previous games for an extended period of time game features the community has a deceralized game economy to distribute authority among differe ceral pois it is transferred from the game team to the players and other community members via a governance model and an invisible hand driven free market governance currely the clash cards game offers a multi layered governance model dispersed on differe social mediums where our community can easily ieract and express their ideas and then vote for new implemeations marketplace moreover the game also has its off line marketplace that holds all game inveory for players as the players progress in the game differe items are unlocked for their perusal the core purpose of the marketplace is to ensure individuality and freedom of expression to each player gameplay the gameplay revolves around collecting and miing new characters or improving the combat abilities of previous characters hence each player has his own experience of the game tokenomics the economy of the clash card game is driven by the clash tokens the clash tokens are deflationary in nature the supply of the tokens will be maiained by the project team to ensure price stability game structure game engine unityd is d to develop the game engine which is a powerful cross platform d engine that ensures a r friendly developme environme website created on node js which is best for implemeing iot developme projects feature iegration it is e through the moralis server crypting language is c it has following underlying features that makes the of this crypting language more ful object orieed language automatic garbage collection cross platform backrd compatibility better iegrity and ieroperability our mission our mission is to create a completely deceralized game that provides all features of defi we have exclusively tried to transform the eire gaming mechanics io a play to earn model thereby inceivizing all activities in the game solely for the purpose of eertainme and earning we believe that eertainme and earning can be two sides of the same coin and with the iegration of suitable features can achieve both social media website discord instagram s reddit s ,introduction of clash card strategy trading card game subscription sale live on pinksale th nov utc nfts utility safu audit,1.0,1,yn9nvj,jerriehilger,0,2022-11-05 23:14:29,1667690080,1669824553,2022-11-05,23:14:29

ethereum,ethereum is notorious for being prohibitively slow and costly at the height of cryptocurrency's most rece hype cycle something as simple as exchanging token for another on the blockchain could have cost uprds of it's no surprise that l protocols have grown in popularity so there are layer rollups for those who to keep their transactions within the ethereum ecosystem and there's a reason why metis and other l solutions have become so popular layer rollups have special systems in place to ensure that transactions aren't spoofed or altered before being se back to ethereum's main chain which is pretty cool in what l protocol do you believe the most and what fascinates you about it did you that the total value locked in ethereum's layer networks has surpassed billion ethereum's layer ecosystem is undeniably growing although the ethereum merge s the second most aicipated blockchain update this year ethereum supporters have long hoped that layer growth will help the ecosystem achieve mass adoption by lowering costs and making the network more accessible while ethereum mainnet coinues to hold the majority of the crypto ecosystem's capital with just under billion locked up layer appears to be catching up quickly ,ethereum's layer ecosystem is undeniably growing,1.0,1,ymrerz,finley_dz,0,2022-11-05 11:32:25,1667647956,1669824737,2022-11-05,11:32:25

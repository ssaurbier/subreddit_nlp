bitcoin,from brett harrison's latest tweet an hour ago spilling the beans many have asked questions about my time at ftx us and why i left when i did as i indicated earlier this week i m happy to begin sharing my experiences and perspective publicly i worked at ftx us for seveeen mohs when my resignation s made public those unfamiliar with my plans were surprised and some questid whether i d been fired it seemed as though i d left a dream job abruptly after a very short tenure the truth s that ftx us hadn t felt to me the dream job it appeared to the industry and media for some time and my departure s not abrupt my relationship with sam bankman fried and his deputies had reached a poi of total deterioration after mohs of disputes over manageme practices at ftx and as a group of my friends meors and investors knew then i d felt such a strong conviction to found my own company that it sn t worth keeping a dream job no matter the prestige or upside no matter the risk it posed to my reputation in departing so early sam asked me to join ftx us casually over text in late march he s my former colleague at jane street and i had fond memories of his presence there we d barely stayed in touch over the years but i d occasionally read news about ftx s growth i s happy to hear from him and ierested to learn more about how things were going at ftx i d n sam to be a conscieious junior trader at jane street who d e well in the programming for traders course i taught there in which he d been my stude in manager meetings about sam s performance the senior traders on his desk indicated he had promise beyond that he seemed a sensitive and iellectually curious person who cared about animals and that endeared him to me my negotiations to join ftx us moved quickly a welcome corast to the mohs they d taken for every move i d made in traditional finance i d built softre for jane street s crypto desk in but hadn t worked on crypto since i s excited to dive back in my first few mohs at ftx us were wonderful i worked largely independely of sam to grow a us based team and foster a professional environme prepared for regulated businesses i made plans with the ledgerx team built out legal compliance and operations departmes with first in class lateral hires and began setting up and building a us regulated retail stock brokerage ftx us s spot exchange s growing in market share the team s dedicated and productive customer feedback s positive i s excited about the future but from the start i noticed that while sam s rarely engaged on the us business decisions impacting the us would come without rning from the bahamas six mohs io my time at the company pronounced cracks began to form in my own relationship with sam around then i began advocating strongly for establishing separation and independence for the executive legal and developer teams of ftx us and sam disagreed i saw in that early conflict his total insecurity and iransigence when his decisions were questid his spitefulness and the volatility of his temperame i realized he sn t who i remembered i sn t sure what accoued for the dramatic change i saw in sam many of us i have family and friends who live with addiction and meal health problems and i ve seen how these problems often manifest without much rning in early adulthood i thought that might be a coributing factor and initially felt sympathetic but i didn t sam well enough personally or have any real time to reflect on the question i s in a business relationship with him and he s making a number of decisions about running a business that i disagreed with there s tremendous pressure not to disagree with sam but i did so anyy at that time and for all of my time at ftx us his influence over the media ftx s partners the veure capital industry and the traditional finance industry s pervasive and unyielding standing up to an insecure prideful manager is hard under any circumstance but it s nearly impossible when every day every major voice of culture and commerce deafens you with a narrative that implies if you disagree with your manager you clearly must be wrong i sn t the only at ftx us who disagreed with sam and members of his inner circle ftx us s staffed with experienced professionals from us finance firms law firms and regulated exchanges our collective experience and professional acumen were frequely treated as though they were irreleva and valueless it s extremely frustrating for all of us over the ensuing mohs i further argued for enacting a sensible hiring policy for staffing ftx us with a c suite of experienced officers for transpare communication between sam and ftx us leadership for gary ng s and nishad singh s softre developme responsibilities to be formally ideified and shared across a larger group for the delegation of managerial responsibility and corols beyond sam and bahamas based executives and other importa matters sam s uncomfortable with conflict he responded at times with dysregulated hostility at times with gaslighting and manipulation but ultimately chose to isolate me from communication on key decision making it felt terrible i sought out information about decisions that had been made behind my back desperate but trying hard not to show it in early april my eleveh moh i made last try i made a written formal complai about what i saw to be the largest organizational problems inhibiting ftx s future success i wrote that i would resign if the problems weren t addressed in response i s threatened on sam s behalf that i would be fired and that sam would destroy my professional reputation i s instructed to formally retract what i d written and to deliver an apology to sam that had been drafted for me that eve solidified my decision to leave i knew an abrupt departure would be harmful to the company and my ftx us reports and i ed to best position the company for future success after i left so i gradually wound down finished building and releasing the us stock brokerage and saw ftx us employees through their mid year reviews and with that i shifted my focus to the future and to my own company the information that is now in the public record from indictmes complais guilty pleas or otherwise show facts that even now after mohs are difficult for me to assimilate io reality i raised concerns at the company believing that the manageme and organizational issues i saw were typical of growing start ups and that my role as an experienced financial services executive s to correct them and unlock the next stage of the company s growth i never could have guessed that underlying these kinds of issues which i d seen at other more mature firms in my career and believed not to be fatal to business success s multi billion dollar fraud it s clear from what has been made public that the scheme s held closely by sam and his inner circle at ftx com and alameda which i s not a part of nor were other executives at ftx us i understand now why they carefully concealed their criminal activity from us we have extensive professional networks our own lines of communication with us regulators and our own authority to speak to us media if any of us had suspected let al learned the truth we would have reported them immediately over my seveeen mohs at ftx us my colleagues and i dedicated everything to serving the needs of our customers and growing real businesses we believed offered consumers a y to more equitably access financial services that are ceral to their lives ancie forms of greed and dishsty destroy trust and corrupt progress the scale of this particular instance of this lesson is difficult to comprehend but far from exceptional in the twelve years of my professional experience in finance it s a strange dissonance after i left ftx us and up uil november nearly every conversation i had with a veure capitalist about my new company eveually came around to the same kind of question is ftx investing is sam okay with you doing this do you mind if we confirm with him after that many conversations eveually came around to the same kind of apology we you weren t involved in what sam and others did but we can t take on the pr risk of associating ourselves with ftx no matter how capable you are or compelling your idea is the last few mohs have provided me with a valuable character study of the industry some treated me an eirely differe person overnight some immediately offered sympathy and support it will be a difficult experience to forget it will also be difficult to forget the frenzied and baseless accusations leveled against me on social media for emple that my resignation could only mean i had ledge of a criminal scheme even though there s no evidence of that and available information shows the scheme s run by a small number of people in another coury and began years before i joined ftx us or that i m seeking a plea deal even though i haven t been accd of wrongdoing and am not a target in any investigation or that while at ftx us i colluded with citadel to manipulate tokenized stock prices yes people are actually saying this i m grateful from the bottom of my heart to those who showed me unvering trust and support through the turbulence of the last two mohs they helped me cut through the noise and remain focd on the future even as they themselves had been harmed by the tragedy of ftx

bitcoin,bitcoin represes differe things for every but in such a polarized world i find refreshing that people can stand side by side for something that they believe even though their reason to believe it is differe some people here for having the option to keep their savings out of the hand of any institution some just believe the number will rise some actually this will free people and provide every a better future a good thing about bitcoin that it aligns inceives and since the inceives are all aligned even if some here for the altruistic reasons or selfish reasons it doesn t really matter and that s a good thing and i feel hope real hope for the future maybe for the first time of my life that we can still unite and build something together slowly but surely i have difficult time to understand why people care about it so much and feel the need to talk badly about it if they believe it will go to zero dollars i t understand the hate or frustration behind it as a couer argume can say the bitcoiners show a similar attitude tords shitcoins but i the real frustration there is not related to the pricing of other coins the frustration is there beca bitcoin represeed and understood by lots of people under the umbrella of cryptocurrencies and the scammers using their fabricated and corolled currencies is damaging to what bitcoin is trying to achieve this is a long road and i myself still very new to this ecosystem and when you about it and everything started from people and now couries discussing it some accepting some refusing energy companies starting mining it feels difficult for me to go back to zero but as i said at the beginning apart from the price perspective it is really refreshing for me to be able to believe in something and do something for it it s something that i can feel lacking for my generation so i m happy to be be here and be a part of this journey ,my personal thoughts and feelings about bitcoin being ideology ,1.0,1,109ia51,lordkorhag,0,2023-01-11 22:37:35,1673476668,1673476669,2023-01-11,22:37:35

bitcoin, from concept to reality the birth and growth of bitcoin the days of being tied to traditional forms of a currency corolled by governmes are g bitcoin a deceralized digital currency allows you to send funds from anywhere in the world to anywhere else instaly securely and with minimal fees if any at all but the story of bitcoin goes back much further than its practical s it all started in with satoshi nakamoto who iroduced the world to a deceralized network capable of achieving consensus without any ceral authority this concept n as the byzaine generals' problem in the world of computer science and distributed systems had stumped experts since it s first described in that is uil nakamoto claimed to have found a solution initially met with laughter and dismissal nakamoto we on to publish softre that allowed the creation of the bitcoin network just three mohs after releasing his groundbreaking paper aka bitcoin a peer to peer electronic cash corary to popular belief bitcoin is not a company or organization but rather a standard or protocol similar to tcp ip or the iernet it operates based on a set of mathematical rules agreed upon by all participas in the network thanks to this system and the inveion of nakamoto bitcoin allows for a completely deceralized network of computers to reach a consensus on transactions happening on the network effectively determining who holds the my in this peer to peer network sending my from accou to another is as easy as sending an email there's no iermediary every minutes the eire network reaches a consensus on what transactions have occurred through a simple electronic election all without the need for a ceral authority but the real significance of bitcoin lies in its poteial for a deceralized organization on a scale never before seen yes it can be d as a currency but it also has the ability to revolutionize voting stock ownership asset registration and even notarization 't get caught up in the fluctuating price of bitcoin the currency instead understand the revolutionary technology and network it has created since the inception of bitcoin the following consensus rules have remained unchanged a maximum of million bitcoins will ever be produced a target of minute block iervals halving eves occurring every blocks roughly every years a block rerd starting at and halving coinually at each halving eve uil it reaches estimated to occur around any change to these parameters requires the consensus of all bitcoin participas so not only does bitcoin provide a deceralized network for financial transactions but it also has a deceralized system for decision making and rule setting hey there if there's something you're ierested in let me i'm alys happy to write about differe topics also i'm trying to post more on twitter so if you're io that give me follow me on twitter my handle is jpeg _tycoon i usually post times a week have a great day , ch from concept to reality the birth and growth of bitcoin ,1.0,1,10876zx,cyber_oligarch,0,2023-01-10 11:06:26,1673348799,1673348799,2023-01-10,11:06:26

bitcoin,hey all i've been going down the rabbit hole these past mohs there's a thought i'm trying to work through and i s wondering if some could sharpen my ing on this i would appreciate it if you could either correct any missing information or lapse in logic so i s listening to a debate between greg foss peter mccormack and peter schiff of schiff's argumes s my can only work if its commodity my he gave the emple that if the gold price for whatever reason starts plummeting it cannot go to zero reason being it will be bought up by industries for their value namely electronics deal fillings and jewelry or sculpture art schiff claims bitcoin can go to zero beca there is not value in the physical world no needs it for computer parts no can eat it etc i find this argume to be incorrect i can't find the ect year but it seems gold s first utilized as comps in electronic devices in the early s that leaves thousands of years where gold's only value s in deistry and jeweler i we can dismiss jewelry as a case for gold why beca jewelry is about signaling power and wealth why not wear a necklace made with fool's gold they could make it just as pretty with a nice yellow shine if there s another another magical metal in history that had all the properties of gold plus it s only accessible by a word phrase that only the bearer s and can teleport it to the other side of the world would there be a demand for jewelry made from this magic metal meanwhile would the demand for gold jewelry go down considerably i so it's accurate to say gold's properties as a my makes people to make jewelry out of it not that people desire to make jewelry out of gold beca its a beautiful shiny malleable metal gold jewelry is kind of a side effect or application of gold's value it doesn't seem a case to me beca once gold's mtary value is g most of the demand for gold jewelry will disappear in regards to deistry there's a bunch of other metals that can be d including silver so the conclusion i'm coming to with this reasoning is other than deistry gold s largely a less rock up uil it s d for electronics it functid as a my for thousands of years beca of it's chemical properties lend well to as a my if gold has function with almost no case in the real world for thousands of years why can't bitcoin doesn't this mean schiff's argume is kind of weak here thing to add doesn't bitcoin have cases in cyberspace there's facebook code that siphons data which is more valuable than a real world commodity oil ,did gold really have use value before electronics ,1.0,1,107y52h,mike_woo_sculptor,0,2023-01-10 02:37:35,1673318267,1673318268,2023-01-10,02:37:35

bitcoin,there is a lot of fear around setting up a multi sig whether it's the setup itself or the fear of restoring the from scratch it can be iimidating to move from single sig io the wonderful world of multi sig but it's worth it as your stack grows to be a more and more substaial part of your wealth so will the fear of losing your stack via a single poi of failure with single sig i that there are ys to create redundancy and security with single sig e g sd card backups multiple seedphrase locations passphrases but i would argue that if you are willing to create redundancy and extra security with single sig you already have the motivation and ly the technical expertise to move to multi sig so eer multi vendor multi sig sparrow first why multi sig in general there are two major compelling reasons for multi sig redundancy from single key loss or theft this is obvious plausible deniability in a wrench attack this second s the main that made me move to multi sig in the ever increasing world of data leaks and kyc it has become almost impossible to stay incognito as a bitcoiner having multi sig makes the effort to physically coerce you so much more difficult if an attacker has to transport you to another location especially if it's a public place a bank security deposit box and as multi sig becomes the norm then physically coercive attacks become less tempting as a whole in the space second sparrow makes multi sig setup a breeze to start it's open source the ui is so much more r friendly than electrum and it automatically prompts super importa steps downloading the backup script to restore the it has been formatted to work seamlessly with almost all the major hardre s finally why multi vendor multi sig why not just coldcards in a of setup or trezors in a of setup by creating a setup where no vendor has a quorum of keys e g coldcards bitboxes trezor you remove that tiny little worry that of the companies could be malicious and has somehow gotten your keys either via a usb connection or incomplete eropy at key generation or that you've been the target of a supply chain attack technically you should even be able to trust closed source hardre s e g ledger in a setup this still recommending open source though as a matter of principle in the bitcoin space however if you go down this route these are the absolute imperatives to setting up a multi sig you must backup your and store a copy of all the xpubs preferably in both electronic and physical form if you need to restore your from scratch you will need the xpubs of all the keys not just a quorum this is by far the biggest pitfall of multi sig luckily sparrow prompts you to create this backup at the time of creation at least preferably all of your hardre s needs to be able to verify the multi sig including the xpubs of all signers on the device i won't go io too much detail but malre could insert additional cosigners at the time of creation so you need an external validation of the setup hardre s that i can do this from personal experience are bitbox coldcard and foundation passport i'm sure there are others but i can't speak to those this applies to both single and multi sig but you should alys verify send and receive addresses on the hardre device itself i will plug for foundation passport on this they make receive address verification via qr code very streamlined there's a lot more to the actual of multisig including using psbts with certain hardre s but these actually 't differ from single sig other than having to do it multiple times rather than just once per transaction i could go on and on about other aspects of vs of storage location of keys seedless setups but this post is getting long if you are ierested in seeing sparrow in action with multi sig here's a great video that finally prompted me to go with sparrow s multisig starts at ,multi vendor multi sig sparrow wallet one of if not the best self sovereign solutions to self custody,1.0,1,106kulg,realistic-jelly8133,0,2023-01-08 14:43:25,1673189022,1673189022,2023-01-08,14:43:25

bitcoin,id to offer a few charts i've been working on for an open discussion all opinions thoughs and suggestions are welcome a few notes to begin orange vertical line is a halving date green line is top forecast for next cycle the date chosen is the average time to top from the previous halvings line of best fit is expial looks linear on a log base graph chart y axis is log scale base first chart halvings top estimate k second chart halvings top estimate k third chart previous low to curre low top estimate k discussion it's ieresting to see the lower the timeframe that the chart looks back the lower the forecast high of the next cycle is i believe the reason is due to the diminishing blow off tops we are seeing from cycle to cycle i have a theory for that bitcoin network access to new funds the first cycle bitcoin gained access to a new pool of funds first movers the second cycle bitcoin also gained access to a new pool of funds through a rise in exchanges providing easy access the third cycle bitcoin gained access to new funds through a large increase in media coverage the fourth cycle curre cycle bitcoin didn't gain access funds that would make as significa a step change to the price as it had in previous cycles as such the lack of blow off top in the curre cycle effects the best fit price forecast more significaly when the time period emined is lower so where should the top estimate fall with such a wide range showing in the charts between k and k with no significa increase in access to new funds i'm looking at k as a top if several larger nations start to adpot btc as legal tender i'm looking at k as a top if several larger nations and institutions gain access through clear and favorable regulation then i'm looking at k as a top i believe on a log scale these eves have a similar impact to the previously discussed eves in past cycles such as first movers rise in exchanges and increase in media converage we are currely at k suggesting from the curre value we see a increase to the top of the next cycle the better question i is what should an exit strategy look well we currely have days uil the next halving and days uil the estimated top based on previous cycles cycle s days from halving to top cycle s days from halving to top with years to top an exit strategy is a tough question to consider especially considering the swings in mtary policy over the last years for now i'm looking purely at the time to top and its correlation with the halving the halving eve inherrely forms a supply demand crunch causing uprd pressure on the price significa uprd prices alys lead to fomo and hence an overshoot on true valve as we have seen in every cycle the time duration of this overshoot has alys been roughly the same in the btc space again days in the past cycles if there is thing i am willing to rely on it is that human nature repeats itself this date for those curious is th of october what would have me re evaluate the estimated top date is if of the aformeid eves large nations adopting btc and institutional access occurs mohs after the halving in which case i we could see the top date pushed further out due to a late boom in access to new funds in this case i would start to look at the k to form the basis of my exit strategy rather than a set date let us your thoughts as a final though provoker we often see an estimate cap put on btc due to its similarity to gold as a store of value digital gold the valuation of the gold market is roughly t however is estimated to be ish physical to paper ratio why do we not see this considered when corrilating it in a store of value sense to btc not financial advice ,btc price forecast amp discussion,1.0,1,102nhng,digital_oceans,0,2023-01-03 23:42:33,1672789365,1672789365,2023-01-03,23:42:33

bitcoin,in which i s speculating on btc s usd price to exceed k in and eveually become the global reserve currency within years let get io it human beings have a hard time understanding expial growth for a number of reasons of the main reasons is that our brains are wired to in linear terms we are d to things growing or changing at a steady rate and expial growth does not follow this pattern expial growth is characterized by a rapid increase in which the rate of increase itself increases this means that the growth becomes faster and faster over time a common emple of expial growth is the concept of compound ierest if you invest a certain amou of my at a certain rate of ierest the amou of my you earn will increase over time however the rate of increase will also increase so the longer you leave the my invested the more it will grow this can be hard for people to wrap their heads around beca it goes against our natural instincts we are d to ing about things in terms of how much they increase by a certain amou over a certain period of time expial growth on the other hand increases by a certain perceage over a certain period of time which means that the rate of increase itself increases another reason why humans have a hard time understanding expial growth is that it is difficult to visualize when we about growth we tend to about it in terms of physical objects or quaities that we can see and touch however expial growth is not something that we can easily observe in the physical world it is a mathematical concept that is difficult to visualize which makes it harder for us to understand a further reason why expial growth can be hard to understand is that it is often coueriuitive for emple if you start with a small number and double it repeatedly the resulting numbers may not seem very significa at first however if you keep doubling the number it will eveually become much larger than you might have expected this is beca each time you double the number you are adding a much larger amou than you did the time before finally humans have a hard time understanding expial growth beca it can lead to seemingly impossible or unbelievable outcomes for emple if a virus were to double in size every day it would seem impossible that it could take over the world in just a few short weeks however this is ectly what can happen with expial growth it may start off small but it can quickly become much larger than any could have predicted if you are still with me and are having a hard time connecting the concept of expial growth to bitcoin let me explain bitcoin a deceralized digital currency has seen expial growth since its creation in of the main reasons for this is that bitcoin has a limited supply there will only ever be million bitcoins in existence and as more and more people become are of and ierested in bitcoin the demand for it increases this limited supply combined with increasing demand has led to the price of bitcoin experiencing expial growth over time however this expial growth has also made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin beca of its non linear growth it is difficult to traditional financial models to forecast the price of bitcoin this has led to a great deal of speculation and uncertaiy surrounding the future of the currency another factor coributing to the difficulty in understanding the expial growth of bitcoin is the fact that it is a relatively new and highly complex technology the of blockchain a deceralized ledger that records all bitcoin transactions adds an additional layer of complexity to the currency this complexity can make it difficult for people to fully understand how bitcoin works and how it is valued the expial growth of bitcoin has been driven by a combination of limited supply increasing demand and the complexity of the technology behind it this growth has made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin but has also attracted a great deal of ierest due to the poteial for significa returns on investme in conclusion humans have a hard time understanding expial growth beca it goes against our natural linear ing is difficult to visualize is often coueriuitive and can lead to seemingly impossible outcomes it is importa for people to understand this concept however beca it can have significa implications in many differe areas including economics population growth and the spread of diseases tldr expial growth is difficult for people to conceptualize beca it goes against our natural linear ing is often coueriuitive and can lead to seemingly impossible outcomes btc has already experienced expial growth multiple times and is still in its infancy dca and hodl ,exponential growth understanding and the lack there of as it relates to btc ,1.0,1,100nz10,neckcrafty5641,0,2023-01-01 17:07:54,1672592892,1672592893,2023-01-01,17:07:54

bitcoin, the increasing hash rate of the bitcoin network the hash rate is a measure of the processing power of the bitcoin network and it has been steadily increasing over time this is an importa factor beca it helps to secure the network and makes it more resista to attacks the halving eve the halving is a programmed reduction in the rate at which new bitcoins are generated which occurs approximately every four years this eve is significa beca it reduces the supply of new bitcoins which can lead to an increase in demand and in turn a higher price rapid adoption rate the adoption rate of bitcoin is often cited as being faster than the adoption rate of the iernet in its early days this suggests that more and more people and businesses are starting to recognize the poteial of bitcoin as a means of payme and store of value increasing mainstream acceptance bitcoin is becoming increasingly mainstream with more businesses accepting it as a payme method and more r friendly platforms and products becoming available poteial to replace traditional global currencies there is a growing belief that bitcoin has the poteial to replace traditional global currencies in the next decade due to a ning faith in elite ceralized banks and a lack of governme accouability bitcoin offers certain advaages over traditional currencies such as its deceralized nature which makes it resista to inflation and manipulation by governmes or financial institutions overall these factors suggest that bitcoin has the poteial to coinue to rise in value in the coming years while it is difficult to predict the ect trajectory of any asset the increasing hash rate halving eve rapid adoption rate increasing mainstream acceptance and the poteial for bitcoin to replace traditional global currencies all coribute to its poteial value in ,there are several key factors that suggest that bitcoin is likely to be valued at over in and could become the global reserve currency in less than years ,1.0,1,zs4joq,neckcrafty5641,0,2022-12-21 23:06:06,1671663984,1671663984,2022-12-21,23:06:06

bitcoin,i'm trying to understand some things about bitcoin and i've been searching for days tching videos reading articles n of them have explained it to my absolute understanding it's frustrating question transaction inputs where ectly do the inputs come from i lear they are utxo's unspe transaction outputs from previous transactions which transactions and to whom does every payme that comes to me generate a new utxo so for emple if people have recely se me btc to a single address i own do i have separate utxo's to spend as inputs for my next transaction that s my reasoning and it seemed to be making sense uil i came across info that said the inputs can come from differe addresses huh okay looks they have a poi though beca when i check the block explorer for transactions i actually see distinct addresses as inputs and outputs it should mean that every address can rather only have utxo at a time right and multiple utxo's should definitely come from differe addresses but if multiple addresses are d as inputs shouldn't all of them be owned by the sender beca only the sender should authorise a transaction now if that's the case how is that e beca with the s i've d trust and binance i 't see an option to select multiple addresses i own and combine their value when i'm sending btc so what's happening can multiple inputs only be achieved using low level coding or something when i search for how to send bitcoin from multiple addresses or similar i 't find anything that answers my question it's as if that's not possible i'm just not getting it for the outputs i understand but the inputs haven't really been explained to me can some who understands this from a to z spell it out for me without leaving anything out i'd be really grateful question block confirmations and reversibility many sources say that transactions that have or more confirmations can be considered irreversible okay logically that should mean that with less than confirmations the transaction can be reversed now what i about block confirmations is that it's the number of blocks that have been added to the blockchain after the that coains the transaction in question so that means even with or two confirmations the block is actually on the public blockchain right so if the transaction can be reversed how is that e will it be pulled down from the blockchain funny question what would happen to the blocks after it meanwhile if you search for can bitcoin transactions be reversed all the answers you get are no so what's really the poi here ,i have big questions about bitcoin transactions ,1.0,1,zql2gk,xor_dinary,0,2022-12-20 10:31:16,1671532292,1671532292,2022-12-20,10:31:16

bitcoin,there's a finite supply of btc and it can only be broken down so much as people lose track of their seed phrases lose their s etc the supply dwindles the price goes up as it becomes more scarce so eveually satoshi would be worth more than many items cost and you can't give change there's already over mil of all btc removed from circulation ,what happens when most of the bitcoin is gone ,1.0,1,zp1pad,50aaron,0,2022-12-18 15:59:14,1671379169,1671379169,2022-12-18,15:59:14
bitcoin,due to bitcoin's hard cap if bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency and all things become naturally priced in bitcoin this would mean that each bitcoin and each sat will become more and more valuable as the economy grows i assuming the economy will grow indefinitely is not as trivial as i'm making it sound but let's just assume it'll be the case for this thought experime so basically things will cost less and less bitcoin and we will reach a poi when a single gummy bear will be worth less than sat at this poi we'll need a smaller unit in order to pay for everyday stuff even a cup of coffee will be worth less than sat eveually hell you could say that about almost anything if you go far enough in the future assuming the human race survives till the universe ends so my questions are what's the code change needed to make this a reality is it just changing some value on a line of code in github and then of course the majority of the nodes accepting the change if so where is that line why sn't bitcoin made infinitely divisible in the first place are there some technical issues that would arise if this s the case what's the reasoning behind choosing million per bitcoin as the lower limit and not million or billion ,assuming bitcoin will need a smaller unit than sats eventually how does that look from a technical point of view ,1.0,1,zp1ow0,21_mil_btc,0,2022-12-18 15:58:44,1671379137,1671379137,2022-12-18,15:58:44

bitcoin,ok basic question here to my ledge btc requires miners to validate transactions proof of work and mining requires an expenditure of energy which costs generally some kind of fiat currency as bitcoin halves and becomes harder to mine the relative profit margin approaches the cost of mining further fluctuations in the value of btc poteially means putting miners underter versus the cost of mining electricity hardre what happens when the cost of mining outstrips the profit of btc say the cost of mining btc is btcs in the relative fiat currency if miners drop out and transactions cannot be validated the relative exchange value of btc is thus since no exchange can take place is there something i'm missing here this seems a weakness inhere to pow crypto especially btc which has a growing cost to mine based upon the halving aspect of the hash mining further i cannot of a real world couerpart since exchanging gold isn't incumbe on any mining it in fact as gold miners drop out the cost of gold would increase due to the effect of scarcity i'm sure i'm missing something since this seems an obvious real threat to crypto as an investme vehicle at least proof of work models that rely on mining to validate exchanges transactions ,question concerning solvency of bitcoin ,1.0,1,zom6ui,alpharustacean,0,2022-12-18 01:17:17,1671326254,1671326254,2022-12-18,01:17:17

bitcoin,hey every i just ed to share my thoughts on bitcoin with the community as a fairly new bitcoiner myself i am constaly amazed by the resilience and strenh of this revolutionary digital asset thing that really stands out to me is the deceralized nature of bitcoin un traditional financial systems that are corolled by a small group of individuals or institutions bitcoin is powered by a global network of nodes that work together to secure the blockchain this deceralization ensures that no single eity has corol over the network making it resista to censorship and corruption another aspect of bitcoin that i find particularly impressive is its ability to act as a store of value while the price of bitcoin can fluctuate in the short term its value has consistely increased over time making it a reliable investme for the long haul but perhaps what i love most about bitcoin is its poteial to bring financial freedom to people around the world in couries with unstable currencies or oppressive governmes bitcoin provides a y for individuals to take corol of their own wealth and financial future overall i am bullish on bitcoin and can't it to see what the future holds for this groundbreaking technology what about you guys why do you love bitcoin ,feeling grateful for bitcoin,1.0,1,zo7x6u,xxshadowassassin69xx,0,2022-12-17 14:53:39,1671288830,1671288830,2022-12-17,14:53:39

bitcoin,the dependence on the governme s ability to pri my has created an unbalanced master slave paradigm where the people are forced to involuarily finance the governme s my prier this reliance on governme priing has effectively removed the accouability of public eities as they no longer work for the people but rather the my prier the governme s ability to endlessly pri my without repercussions means that the people no longer own their governme the lack of checks and balances in the system has cad public eities to instead look to outside sources such as corporations ll street foreign nations and the military industrial complex for extra my similar to a side hustle for a paycheck this creates a conflict of ierests as the people no longer own their governme and the governme is now working for the my prier not the people this is why there is such a disconnect between the governme and the people these days the people are increasingly feeling unacledged and unheard and this is due to the governme s reliance on its my prier public eities are no longer accouable to the public as they only strive to please the my prier the good news is that there is a solution to this problem and that is bitcoin by creating a deceralized mtary system the people can take back ownership of their governme as the my prier no longer holds the power bitcoin creates an environme of financial freedom as the governme no longer has the power to corol the my supply furthermore it creates the transparency that the governme and the people need in order to work together in conclusion since the transition from hard my to fiat my the governme has become a master and the people have become its slaves public eities are no longer accouable to the people as they now work for the my prier however with the iroduction of bitcoin the people can once again take back ownership of their governme and create a more transpare and fair relationship between the two parties ,who works for whom ,1.0,1,znqnpq,andrwuz,0,2022-12-16 22:14:04,1671228862,1671228863,2022-12-16,22:14:04

bitcoin,the only thing i is missing about bitcoin technology is a y to really slowly recycle itself let me explain imagine in thé far future when all bitcoins will be mined or almost the biggest bitcoin sources available will be old storages from our time old accou lost bitcoins etc they will probably be an industry trying to found them back in a y or another the amou of lost bitcoin will be massive and compared to thé mining production they will be a time where finding only a single hard from our time could be worth of multiple year of mining production this is not a sane balance for an economy the non lost bitcoins will be d for thé economy but if they are btc holders who are too big they will own a too big of thé total amou of my to exist let s say a familly for exemple that inherited bitcoin from generation to generation they could or own stupid amou of things or acting by themselves as a modifier of bitcoin value orders of magnitudes too high probably with the ability to make prices triple or divide by easily if a my this exist in far future propose who are not privilegied by it will legitimately look ay for other solition and probably create other cryptos collectively and decide to them instead what would be a imo sane thing to do is adding a evaporating rate to bitcoin let me explain to avoid that few peoples could own too massive proportion of bitcoins and keep the currency viable and fair enough to let peoples coinue to it we could maybe add a system who could make a small évaporation raté happen so for exemple each year of the btc you own evaporate and go back to the mineable bitcoin pool numbers can vary this will also allow a reneble and consta suply of new btc this is the most equal option every have the same evapotax we could also balance this in a more fair y evaporzting bitcoin faster for biggest bitcoin holders above some cap to avoid peoples to squeeze this by dividing their wealth io multiple accou we will need them to be or nominated to a single person or to a single family and a y to make sure it is not squeezable then let s say that for each time you own x more than the average accou balance to let this method grow with increasing of decreasing population you pay twice more so per year evaporate of your btc above time the average balance above time the average above time the average k m time thé average etc etc evaporate per year at million time the average at million time at a billion time etc that also add an inceive to make thé average peoples wealthier so it will be really hard to own more than a billion time the average person wealth who seem a minimum to keep things somehow balanced of course that s random number that could be adjusted up or down that will keep the economy somewhat balanced and allow more evaporation to happen and at the same time still allow for big fortunes to exist but without having too much inequalities capped in this exemple at billion time the average beca after that evaporate per year so basically all of it we could maybe even imagine a system where the under average balances get a small perceage of wealth evaporated from big we could say that half evaporation go to mining and half to slightly lower inequalities could be a modest redistributive and fair economical system we need also a y to make peoples who die inherit their fortune to their kids to avoid the death peoples accous to cou among the total number of active accous and if not possible redistributed to the mining pool this y we could have a mtary system bitcoin with a fix amou of currency a y to slowly get back poteial lost bitcoins trough evaporation a y to slowly give back bitcoin to the mining pool and keep the suply running a y to avoid too much inequalities but still allowing fortunes to exist without allowing too indece s or monopoles to a y poteially to redistribute a part of the wealth to the less fortunate trough a part of the evaporation we could call this condensation on lower than average or average balanced accou this will be a low amou in any case beca lower than average accou and average accou will be much more in number than the above s who pay for it and that s how you keep a currency system sane stable and fiable for extremely long periods of time and make it automatically adjusted to total population number changes up or down allowing humanity to eveually becaume a multi planetary specie as we should be if we are not filtered out of existence before and that s how you also assure peoples to be able to keep a stable deceralised predictible non inflationist currency who evaporate or not at all or reaaaly slowly depending on how rich you are also putting a smaaaaal pressure on peoples to spend or invest and keep the my moving in the economy being rich is this world would only mean owning a bigger part of the cake who evaporate faster and of nothing is e or if badly d or lost will go back to average with time trough evaporation who go half to the less fortunate half for the miners who keep the thing working a bitcoin made on this kind of system could be much more viable long term and even becaume a ultimate and universal currency aly adjusting itself to any situation to go back to the society wealth distribution programated in some years and still of course remunerating miners and mining who make the system work and coinue to that s an ieresting topic imo and could be the solution to a lot of issue that today currency have or even cryptos have or even deceralised cryptos have exc my bad english ,bitcoin in the far

bitcoin,bitcoin is all about understanding and managing your own risk and trust be that the decision to run a node or not a light or not a company node or not you also have to decide who you will give your business to and what risk you're willing to expose yourself to when engaging with bitcoin services with that in mind let's conceptualize a few differe kinds of bitcoin services so we to look out for them and can make educated choices as consumers the low trust service this is a bitcoin service delivered in a low trust manner where the bitcoin r need only utilize softre they run and corol for the services and can protect themselves from malicious third parties with very little trust or consequence from peers this is the gold standard of bitcoin service emples include lightning routing lightning liquidity marketplaces pool coinjoins joinmarket coinsps submarine sps loop and others when at all possible this is the kind of service you to run many services and coracts in bitcoin or layers will claim to be low trust even deceralized which isn't all necessary for a business they are supposed to be ceralized but very few are ask yourself what recourse you al have against fraud and what fraud would be possible for emple in lightning you protect yourself from fraud by tching the blockchain and storing proof of your off chain transactions you can broadcast at will you have responsibility tch the blockchain and recourse publish transactions proving fraud and claim balance the risks revolve around your own capacity time delays locking up your coins and other general inconveniences not impacting your custody trust the service will be provided this is your typical business or website where you pay for the good or service before you get it and have little to no recourse if the service is not provided pretty normal you're risking whatever you're spending in a transaction emples include every mercha business accepting bitcoin the merchas using btcpay server and non custodial exchanges bullbitcoin s this is also a very good model with limited risk but often little recourse the federated trust service this is a bitcoin service which spreads responsibility across a number of actors for success or failure it's not nearly as good as trusting yourself and relies on third parties to protect your ierests emples include liquid rsk s peg multisig custodians bisq escrow these services often delve io shitcoins and when they do should be avoided any other the risk in these cases is often not exceptionally limited include custody and your recourse relies on third parties if any exists at all the first party custodian this bitcoin service relies on only itself it often prides itself on this self reliance boasting a lack of third parties and self custody river financial is a good emple if you can trust the business these can be quality services the risks in these custodians are similar to a federated service but only trusting party the rd party custodian this is a bitcoin service which relies on a third party custodian prime trust s emples include strike and sn s among many others while both are bitcoin only companies the custodian they rely on holds over shitcoins s these kinds of services can be dangerous beca they can appear to be very bold bitcoin only companies but on closer inspection you will find they 't self custody a ceral tena of a good bitcoin participa in the space r and business a this can expose rs to all kinds of risks and broadens the number of actors exposing rs to risk even if it's not just custody for emple kraken just leaked r data s via a zendesk leak this is why evaluating who you are trusting is importa and i make these specific emples to illustrate why you can't take even well respected community members at their word you need to evaluate for yourself are you trusting them or a tower of service providers the shitcoin casino this isn't a bitcoin service at all it's a public harm these are exchanges

bitcoin,since bitcoin had a price people have tried to recreate it but with twists the owner of this gets a huge chunk of supply then supply gets released when mining or this has this cool developme team or technology behind it therefore better than bitcoin these recreations all focd on the idea of bitcoin as a technology when in fact even the technology d to run bitcoin is subject to change at the whims of social consensus take robux for a minute robux is a popular digital asset issued by the robux corporation it has exchanges though mostly underground for fear of reprisal from the robux corporation what is the functional difference between robux using an sql database between their servers and robux using a private blockchain where only robux servers can create the proofs of work for transfer its still permissid robux still has full say over whether transfers even happen between accous and robux is still sold by the robux corporation crypto is much more akin to robux in this y crypto is not subject to the whims of its rbase it is only subject to the corporation behind it bitcoin does not work in this y bitcoin is a social construct the bitcoin core devs have e a pretty good job at making sure nothing that would upset the people who run the softre gets through but what would happen if they did new rule block sizes will now be gb instead of mb the first problem they'd run io is that the new softre is not compatible with the softre every else is running people who run the softre would be pretty upset at hard drive space filling up rapidly and fork the project io a new repository you now have two chains but which chain is bitcoin so that's what i mean when i say bitcoin is a social construct any argume you'd make over which gets to be bitcoin is you enforcing that social construct the curre construct around what is bitcoin is that the chain that is compatible with the older softre gets to be bitcoin it but the original bitcoin github repo gets to be bitcoin i hear you scream so lets talk about the next problem the original repo would encouer from ignoring the people who run bitcoin when you a bitcoin and you 't run your own node you the node that softre defaults to now maybe that softre enforces the idea that bitcoin is the core repo but it could just as well decide to enforce the social construct that bitcoin is whatever is compatible with an older version of the softre in fact it probably would do this by default via not noticing that a new clie s even released i mean i can't help but notice that this very sub has a link to download version of core even though version s released miners and price i can't talk about the role that miners would play io this without also including how the price of each chain would effect the miners if rs prefer to chain over the other its price will go up which makes miners to mine that chain instead of the other this means the chain that goes against the rs wishes is vulnerable to the hashpower of the chain that supports r decisions being part of the domina mtary network has its perks the domina mtary network is evidence of the strenh of the social construct at hand right now the strongest social construct for my is that governme issued paper is my bitcoin is here to challenge that social construct with its own ,bitcoin is a social construct not crypto,1.0,1,zj27qc,nerd2ninja,0,2022-12-11 18:10:53,1670782265,1670782266,2022-12-11,18:10:53

bitcoin,this post is for those who have been tipped maybe the tipper linked this post to help you or you to learn more about lips on the bitcoin sub r lipbot for more official information non you can start right now without set up you just need some to tip you i recely discovered there is a tip bot that you can in the bitcoin sub and i others the great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning and then withdraw your tips or your own lightning to add sats to your personal tip jar you 't need to if some tips you sats then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your rname and add in sats to it that's the minimum tip then you can the same command in a message and tip some else no need to even set up a you can sats all you just from your own tips get them and pass them on side note you can send private messages to the bot and it will give your balance or a code to send sats to or receive sats via lightning just using the links on the bot reply to tip type lip or any number higher than it will tip the person you are replying to if you 't have the funds available in your accou for the tip then the bot creates a lightning invoice that you can pay using lightning with a setting up a lightning and adding sats to the bot a great guide from double lr tip him if he posts in commes i muun too so you are in luck it works a very small bit differe than you i am on a ph so this is what i just did to transfer sat from the tipbot balance to my muun very easy you ll see prior to doing this you must have the fully set up get your seed phrase words aka your keys and write them down and keep them safe then do the rescue emergency pdf thing too it s pretty easy and worth the hassle of figuring it out after that open muun and select receive at the top there are two option buttons select lightning and the screen will change to a lightning address at the bottom you will see invoice settings select that and you will see a button to add an amou and an expiry time for the invoice press add and eer the amou you to withdraw from the tipbot balance press confirm and the invoice will change again to the address that represes what you just created an invoice for the amou of sats you eered press copy and the invoice will be copied to your clipboard in your ph open reddit and find a tipbot message it has the blue links in it you see it every time a tip is given press withdraw and it will create the dm format for you once you learn the format very simple you can create it from scratch a normal dm but the blue link does this for you uil you learn the format well enough to create it on your own on the dm page created by the blue link there is a spot that says put_invoice_here delete only that simple phrase and then paste in to the same spot and your invoice you copied earlier will appear the line that says withdraw needs to stay where it is press send open muun as fast as you can and see if you can beat the withdral to your from reddit enjoy fellow redditor it seems a lot but i m reality steps will become step for you and steps will also become step for you so once you learn it it s basically two steps lightning is badass enjoy fellow redditor general help some ful faq type information not included on the bot website if you are clueless then hopefully this list will give you enough information to start to google the gaps in your ledge what is bitcoin it's a digital commodity gold but much easier to transport what are sats each bitcoin is made of a million sats dollars and ces but with lots more sats per bitcoin to make paymes easier what is lightning the bitcoin nextwork is slow and super secure great for transfer of large amous of my but not good for tips and coffee so clever people built a second layer on top and that is the lighting network it allows you to send sats super fast and cheap what is a bot an automated service to help you 't worry about sending messages to it as long as you 't change the words it's just sending a command to a computer and it will return your answer privately do i need a perhaps not you can be given tips and then check your balance here on reddit and only tip others using your tips a great little circular community but then i do need a yes when you either have so many tips on your reddit ln bot accou that you to withdraw them fully or them in the real world then you will need a or if you have no tips and to tip then you will need a what's a reddit ln bot accou the clever people who made this tip bot made it so you automatically get a little just for with the bot only attached to your rname that the bot can to track your tips and balances smart what's a lightning a lightning probably an app that you can install the app allows transfer of bitcoin sats to any other s great for buying stuff in locations that accept bitcoin sending bitcoin or sats to your friends l and for sending sats to fill your tip accou where do i get a lightning when youre ready to google it and find you anything else to only last bit if you tip more than you have availabille or you try to make a deposit clicking and sending deposit as a message to the bot then the clever bot will give you a long number code that you can copy and eer io your lightning app to make a payme when you do you will have d bitcoin and passed a tip to some else how nice of you

bitcoin,so from what i've gathered there's multiple catalysts for bitcoin price next year despite a looming recession which is a fact at this poi first is the halvening obvious by the end of there should be the peak and preceding that hopefully a long uprd trend tords a minimum of k per bitcoin according to models that have a historical price accuracy of bitcoins value should peak at around m per bitcoin in average recession lasts for around mohs so by the time this will be over bitcoins price should be around k at the end of next year beginning of second is the gaap accouing standard next year this law will be improved so that companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet will be able to write them at their fair value currely if the price goes down in value but jumps back up again companies have to write down the value of the digital asset and can't mark it up starting from next year it will be differe which apparely has been a deal breaker for institutional investors in the past third is the capital inflow of traditional investors investme banks pension funds ceral banks small big couries and differe funds currely holding digital assets in their portfolio is considered to be risky due to the absence of regulation transparency public disclosings from the beginning of next year january the united states congress will be having a session where the sec and congress will both fight over which eity gets to set the rules they both seem to be in a hurry to be the first s which is a positive for crypto investors as the institutions feel safer to invest the capital inflow should be somewhere around trillion usd for the price to reach k at the end of next year curre price would have to quadruple so approximately trillion usd would be sufficie total amou of assets held by mutual funds in the us is trillion usd germany has trillion and uk brazil and switzerland collectively own trillion usd that's close to trillion if of this would go to bitcoin its price would quadruple another scenario would be where we would consider the multiplier effect x of investing in the stock market in which only billion of capital inflow from institutional investors would be necessary to reach a trillion market cap x billion usd trillion i included switzerland beca its ceral bank has said it's ierested in acquiring bitcoin there's a few other poteial catalysts in the future that might shape the perception of cryptocurrencies to a positive in the coming year big couries iran russia adopting cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and the pilot of cbdcs also ukraine is of the largest bitcoin holders so there are multiple concrete things to look forrd to in next year and especially the year after despite the coming recession the biggest factors for a long bear phase are imo rising oil prices and ierest rates uil the end of next year in addition to that revolving and non revolving credits are at an all time high while the savings rate of americans is at an all time low if the recession will last around mohs it should be a relatively sound timing for the price to shoot up to k per bitcoin during the third picture is metcalf's law which predicts the value to be minimum k by it's not as delicious as the other two models but still dece considering the fact that it would be the minimum value according to this model the value would be minimum m usd during and hover above m uil it reaches during next decade these are just some thoughts things i've gathered hope some finds it ful cheers ,catalysts for bitcoin ,1.0,1,zg8are,alexipoika123,0,2022-12-08 19:12:13,1670526747,1670526748,2022-12-08,19:12:13

bitcoin,hi every i tried out bisq and it s quite successful i made some buys made some sells and it seems things work for the most part it has some bugs but nothing that does not eveually get resolved i had trouble figuring out robosats i'm letting you my mistakes so that you 't make them it s probably beca i 't how to the lightning network so well i tried using electrum with their trolines here's how it we i got tor and figured out how to run it i we to the robosats website and found the tor link i we to the robosats site and i actually properly saved my bot i set up a small electrum troline channel for something small btc i found a deal that i thought s reasonable and clicked on it i se them my security deposit through a lightning invoice now i have three hours i then tried to set up a few differe half sized btc channels that would not make the whole payme i didn't that this s a problem i then learned through experience that the only y to pay the full invoice s to a full sized channel that would cover the whole payme i made a new larger channel that would easily cover the whole payme i clicked pay for this lightning invoice three times and it failed three times each of those times the troline tried to send eight times i lost my security deposit i'm in the process of closing my lightning channels possible analysis electrum is not that good for lightning trolines are not that good for transactions above btc i needed a y to practice these things and could not find any thoughts on what else we can learn ,messing up at robosats,1.0,1,zfwugv,extrastone,0,2022-12-08 11:59:26,1670500776,1670500777,2022-12-08,11:59:26

bitcoin,as you might the lightning network started back in march and serves as payme layer to scale the transaction speed of the bitcoin network and reduce the cost per transaction at the same time due to the lack of liquidity it s really hard to actually send paymes at the beginning while it became easier to participate in the network there are still challenges to solve in order to make it accessible for the broader mass of the main problems is the need to create an invoice each time you to receive a payme from a ux perspective this is absolutely horrible lnurl and bolt try to solve some of these issues which i will try to explain in the following part lnurl what ectly is that lnurl is a stack of simple protocols for coordinating information needed to make paymes over the lightning network using the full list of lnurl protocol pieces can be found here but i'm just going to go io a few core s that overlap with bolt the three core features of the lnurl protocol are defined as lnurl auth where a public key can be d to log in to a service lnurl pay where a can ping a server through a static qr code and retrieve an invoice lnurl withdraw where a can ping a server and request that the server pays an invoice provided by the for using the autheication protocol the server provides a randomly generated number which the r's signs with a newly generated key after the server retrieves the signed randomly generated number the key gets saved and can be d for future logins the invoice request functionality is a y to provide information to a r about a payme they wish to make in a format that is not an invoice this provides a description of the payme the minimum and maximum amou the service expects to be paid and a url for the from which to request an actual invoice from here the displays this information to the r allowing them to set a final amou and request an invoice after sending the invoice request and receiving back from the server the verifies that the amous match what the r set and pays the invoice note this feature is already available if you're using phoenix of satoshi or blue muun does not support it as of now december the withdral request works by pinging the service and receiving in response a description a url to send an invoice to a random string and a minimum amou and maximum amou that can be withdrawn after filling in the appropriate value the returns an invoice to the server and if it is valid and within the amou parameters the service pays the invoice the lnurl autheicate protocol can be d in addition to this to ensure that only the iended r can successfully withdraw using the lnurl link common case would be if you to withdraw your sats from a lightning service such as the lipbot here on reddit or the lot on telegram bolt why do we need it the term bolt is the acronym for b asis o f l ightning t echnology you can compare these to the bips bitcoin improveme proposals which are design documes for iroducing features or information to bitcoin the bip as amended has since become the standard y of formally communicating ideas about poteial bitcoin improvemes as meid at the beginning of this post there are some ux flaws which need to be addressed to understand the problems bolt attempts to solve it is mandatory to have a look at the curre standard which is d to create invoices bolt invoices generated by the bolt standard consist of three main comps the destination where the payme is supposed to be se to public key of the node the amou which is about to be transferred a hash which represes the payme secret the main problem of bolt invoices is that they can only be d once and therefore need to be created in realtime the creation of the invoice leads to the publishing of the payme secret and is therefore unsecure if you would create an invoice with the same secret some could fraudulely request my due to the fact that the secret is n this makes the usage of qr code invoices for ations or other cases impossible what is bolt bolt offers an attempt to achieve some of the core functionality that lnurl provides without requiring the of a web server an offer encodes the data necessary to reach a node to request an invoice to make a payme either a node _id or a blinded path the last few hops in an onion route pre computed and encrypted to that node using onion messages it also can encode a minimum amou for a payme the currency being paid in an expiry time and minimum maximum quaity numbers for purchasing multiple items this is all of the information necessary to fetch an actual invoice from the node that issued the offer some who s to pay an invoice does so over onion messages of the core features of bolt it allows nodes to make a direct end to end encrypted connection between each other that does not involve a lightning channel just lightning paymes these can be d to onion route messages after obtaining an offer a payer will the information encoded in it to send an invoice _request message the creator of the offer will then respond back with an actual invoice there is also support for generating unique per r offers that allow the receiver to request a payme from the creator of the offer similar to lnurl's withdral request feature bolt invoices commit to a unique payer key this can be d in the case of issuing refunds to prove you are the person who actually paid the invoice this can also be d in combination with the withdral offer to guaraee that only the correct person can succeed in getting an invoice paid by the creator as opposed to whoever is able to get a copy of the offer what's best both lnurl and bolt enable a more r friendly y for paying or getting paid on the lightning network while lnurl sits on the application level bolt provides a solution on proctocol level where the new offers do neither require a web server tls certificates nor a domain and provide a higher level of protection than lnurl using blinded paths the bolt offers allow the confideiality of the node id which additionally enriches the privacy it's importa to say both solutions can exist simultaneously while online shops and other service providers operate a web server anyy lnurl is a good add on bolt mostly addresses the endrs and offers a more convenie y to ieract with the lightning network ,what's lnurl and bolt ,1.0,1,zfw1ek,mcrech,0,2022-12-08

bitcoin,hello every i am really loosing my mind on this i am actually not a technical noob but also not the very best technican but things this should actually be very easy for me what i to do i just to connect my freshly set up sparrow to my freshly set up bitcoin core first of all my setup bitcoin core on windows bit pc local network sparrow on linux laptop same local network i've set up bitcoin core on my windows pc as usual and blocks are up to date these lines were added to the bitcoin conf file on my bitcoin core windows node rpcr r rpcpassword password main rpcbind rpcbind rpcallowip rpcallowip where rpcbind is the local ip address of the bitcoin core node on windows rpcallowip is the local ip address of the laptop where sparrow is running on the subnet mask is so should be fine i've set up a few things firell rules and so on i've pressed on test connection hundreds of times and it did not work at all somehow it suddenly worked and i got successfully connected to bitcoin core i s really happy but after closing the and opening again it again won't connect at all again i am getting the following error message could not connect check if bitcoin core is running and the autheication details are correct see i noticed something really strange as well when i click test connection on the laptop in sparrow even when sparrow shows the above error the bitcoin core screen changes from you have no loaded to a that is named sparrow in bitcoin core and shows btc i did not set up any on sparrow yet i tried to do some research on this issue but it looks i am al with this and feel kinda stupid since i 't get what i am doing wrong i also tried disabling the windows firell before connecting sparrow to it without any success then i've randomly found this issue on github i've tried the following workaround stated on the github issue page shutting down bitcoin core on windows shutting down sparrow on linux deleting a folder called sparrow in the bitcoin core directory starting up bitcoin core again starting up sparrow again and tada it works it says connected to but only time when i close bitcoin core or sparrow again it won't connect afterrds it gives me the above meid error again but when i follow the workaround that i've stated above again it works again uil i close bitcoin core or sparrow and open it again so it only works for a while when i delete the sparrow folder in the bitcoin core directory but only uil n of both applications get closed if i do so i have to re apply the stated workaround other strange things i've noticed when i do the workaround and are able to connect sparrow to bitcoin core it does not show any inbound connection but sparrow says connected to when i add disable to bitcoin conf it does not even work with the meid workaround even if it should as far as my understanding is correct when eering wrong autheication credeials on purpose it takes some time uil i get the error message could not connect when i eer them correctly it shows this error message instaly i got the feeling that it actually can connect since the time uil the error message shows up is less than a second compared to when i eer credeials wrong which takes seconds uil the error message shows up can any tell me what the actual heck is happening here that's of the strangest thing i've ever seen in my year computer carreer sure i could just to this workaround every time but i feel kinda uncomfortable to connect create any with this strange issue being prese i should meion that a vpn softre is running on both machines anyys it works when applying the workaround even with vpns on i've enabled the local connections options within both vpn guis but it also does not work without following the workaround when both vpn softres are completely closed and shut down so the vpn can't be the ca of this issue i i really appreciate any kind of help is there any possibility that this is a serious issue by sparrow and not my fault at all thanks for any help in advance ,really strange issue when connecting sparrow wallet to bitcoin core,1.0,1,zfvw1i,exchange_rec,0,2022-12-08 11:05:54,1670497567,1670497567,2022-12-08,11:05:54

bitcoin,i seem to remember every halving being approached with some trepidation as to how the miners would adapt historically price goes up and more hash power gets turned on can this happen another times in my simple understanding each halving will double the cost of production for most commodities the price will reach equilibrium near the cost or production assuming more halvings assuming a curre cost of about per btc which i is a low estimate this puts the bitcoin cost of production at x or over t per btc in this seems kind of absurd especially since it assumes the difficulty and hash rate stay consta to what they are today in given the trajectory of hash rate it should be safe to assume the difficulty will be much higher in than in this would mean the cost of production is even higher than t and the market price would need to be higher than t btc to support this that would put the market cap at m x t or quiillion again an absurd number as this is in t odays dollars inflation would make this even higher another possibility is that the hash rate reaches a maximum and then starts to drop off if the difficulty is too high miners will have to drop out of the race and reduce the difficulty and cost to be under the market price this would lead to ceralization or at least a reduction in the number of eities corolling the mining hash rate i understand that at some poi most of the block rerds will be in transaction fees but how does this impact the overall economics of cost of production the fees are currely running around of the block rerd though when the network is busy it has spiked to from what i can tell the fees will stay relatively the same in absolute btc earned but the coinbase rerd gets reduced with the halvings this seems it would put a cap on cost of mining a block thats something x what it is today so this would put cost of blocks around m and since that's for btc today that would cap it around m cap to btc more realistic but not sure the math holds up ,impact of more halvings,1.0,1,zcrzj9,arnzenarms,0,2022-12-05 01:02:54,1670202190,1670202191,2022-12-05,01:02:54

bitcoin,a possibly stupid question about mining inceive and how it relates to future network security if the following are true the overall strenh of the network can be computed in dollar terms by determining the cost to acquire of the network hashrate the more costly it is to obtain network hashrate the more secure it is the network hashrate will be proportional roughly to the profitability of mining times some coefficie for how efficie the prese day hardre is eg if btc per day are rerded now then it's worth investing x per th s on mining equipme then in the future as block rerds approach zero won't it becoming increasingly less profitable to mine and thus won't network hashrate stall or dip and thus won't it becoming increasingly cheap to acquire network hashrate as an extreme emple if the rerd is only btc day mining hardre would become quite cheap and it'd be easy to buy half of the hashrate it seems that in the future as block rerds diminish in order for the network hashrate to be prohibitively expensive btc would need to have astronomically high prices or transaction fees would need to be astronomically high it seems as though through virtue of halving block rerds bitcoin is naturally pushed tords becoming a less secure over time or b expially expensive to both of these tendencies would seem to perpetuate a death spiral in the utility a less secure less valuable and b expensive to transact less utility what am i missing as this relates to ceralization of mining here's another aside seemingly bitmain could right now probably single handedly manufacture enough hashrate to own the network in relatively short order they are more inceivized to sell hardre for now however in the future when mining hardre is unable to be profitably sold beca the block rerds are not valuable it seems as though their inceive could shift tords simply owning the network and cashing out ,as block rewards diminish how will the network be incentivized to remain secure ,1.0,1,zbvnzk,pennyether,0,2022-12-04 00:37:19,1670114253,1670114253,2022-12-04,00:37:19

bitcoin,what we are beginning to see with energy production in places kazakhstan and tes is using bitcoin mining as a sort of financial battery to store the value of produced energy digitally and then to this value to trade between energy producers based on need this will make energy markets more efficie and make energy grids more resilie you can produce at below peak times and then buy at peak times with the bitcoin mined at other times you can produce a sellable asset with ste energy and energy resources to offset the cost of production this is faastic but a less talked about subseque effect of this that i possibly naively foresee is the increasing competition for energy by consumers vs bitcoin miners often the energy producers themselves a time will come if this coinues when an energy producer will ask what's more profitable mining or selling the energy to consumers and when that happens the price of energy will begin to be dictated by the price of bitcoin how much you pay for electricity will be tightly correlated with how much bitcoin can be harvested with that energy and how much in fiat it can be sold for once this happens bitcoin then becomes a sort of de facto reserve currency for bitcoin markets the price of energy will become volatile as the price of bitcoin and it would make sense then to price energy directly in bitcoin bitcoin will become the unit of accou in energy markets once this happens i expect bitcoin to grow out of just the energy industry as a unit of accou over time and begin to be d as a unit of accou for more and more markets since energy costs are so fundameal to the costs of most other things this phenomenon we are seeing now the of bitcoin mining to extract value from ste energy will directly lead to bitcoin being d as a unit of accou worldwide perhaps i'm missing something but i 't so ,the use for bitcoin mining in stabilizing energy markets is very interesting,1.0,1,zboc1v,ur_mothers_keeper,0,2022-12-03 19:28:46,1670095738,1670095739,2022-12-03,19:28:46

bitcoin,a friend of mine is a well n finance professor and advises the fed we hang out once a year for a few hours but never discussed bitcoin he has alys thought it is trash worthless less we hung out last week and he s ierested this time in discussing bitcoin it didn't really get anywhere but i probably didn't do the best job in defending bitcoin the fact that he is a very promine finance professor didn't make it easy today he se me an opinion piece written by paul krugman that just came out yesterday which basically declares crypto to be dead yet again ths time i can gather my thoughts properly before responding but i thought i would share them here in case any has any commes on my response that could be helpful thank you for sending me this article i hate to parrot the same type of talking pois that krugman hears but i do believe that krugman doesn't get it more to the poi though no has explained it to him beca what is written in his article is mostly unrelated to what ehusiasts would talk about first forget about anything non bitcoin second and the main poi inflation is generally speaking and in the last years a horrible thing if inflation comes about from positive economic activity then fine but if you sum up all of the inflation over the last years in the usa i am guessing it has been a huge negative on overall society this is a claim that i am making unverified by me if i am wrong about this then i am very misinformed and would gladly relinquish a lot of my support for bitcoin inflation is the main problem that bitcoin is trying to solve satoshi nakomoto probably said it best in as few words as possible the root problem with conveional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work the ceral bank must be trusted not to debase the currency but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust banks must be trusted to hold our my and transfer it electronically but they lend it out in ves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve we have to trust them with our privacy trust them not to let ideity thieves drain our accous their massive overhead costs make micropaymes impossible satoshi's poi above is about the debasing of fiat currencies his poi is fractional reserve lending why is fractional reserve lending a problem seems to have worked all these years except that it hasn't and in the banks had to be bailed out with us taxpayers footing the bill in the short term and the long term you will notice that krugman's article states nothing about the above and that's why he doesn't get it this is what bitcoin is all about but the most natural follow up question is how does bitcoin solve the above problems why bitcoin why not rocks or seashells or stuffed animals that is another conversation qar,conversing with a fed advisor about bitcoin,1.0,1,zaykzp,qanonretard,0,2022-12-02 21:38:39,1670017130,1670017131,2022-12-02,21:38:39

bitcoin,in a nutshell banks are a bit ftx highly leveraged and can't sustain a bank run in many cases fortunately deposits are insured in the us the insured amou is up to k and the eu up to k prior the financial crisis of if banks were too big to fail the governme taxpayers would save them but since the cost of doing so is becoming too big they iroduced bail ins instead of bail outs bail ins mean that banks can take their customers deposits if they are insolve basically they can legally do what sbf did to pay their bills the governme won't step in anymore the bank will just steal your deposits to save them and no you won't get them back fortunately you are still protected up to the insured amou k but everything above can be taken from you now if we assume that there will be another financial banking crisis which is almost certain and if we assume the next crisis will be bigger than the last which is also ly beca that is what we have seen in the past it's just a question of time before some people are going to lose a lot of my in a bank that s supposed to be regulated trusted and safe s ,i think bail ins are another reason why bitcoin will become more popular over time if you don't know what bail ins are learn more about them and educate your friends and family ,1.0,1,z5yhvh,bitcorner22,0,2022-11-27 11:01:27,1669546922,1669817895,2022-11-27,11:01:27

bitcoin,i promise this is not fud trying to have an hst discussion here and i the term 'bad actors' very loosely here i just got e tching the latest 'what bitcoin did' podcast and part of it really stuck out in my head why is the btc hash rate at literal all time highs when price is so low and miners are reaching a poi where they are not profitable there s meion of 'concern that maybe nation states are starting to turn on machines and mine at whatever it costs to get around sanctions' for emple russia mining with their close to free natural gas so i started to what if this s to actually happen there s some inceive either to simply just mine at a loss to get any amou of btc or to possibly attempt to attack the network could be for many reasons to flat out mine at a loss this would lead to hst mining companies turning off their machines beca it s not profitable to run them differe places pay differe energy costs so obviously this would impact some couries more than others i assume maybe wrongly that the us would be the first to be non profitable should the hash rate coinue to climb while btc price coinues to fall i at least i thought a lot of the design of bitcoin is based on game theory that miners will coinue to join the network as adoption and price increases what happens to this game theory in this case when a 'bad actor' could possibly have close to free energy what would happen in this scenario when some eity is mining even if there is no financial inceive to do so would the network difficulty drop enough for 'hst' miners to keep mining to secure the network in this case i assume places kazakhstan have very cheap energy that would allow hst miners there to coinue to mine well after places the us have turned off their miners how would this realistically play out ,possibility of 'bad actors' mining btc at a loss,1.0,1,z57dlb,twinchell,0,2022-11-26 13:18:40,1669468734,1669818133,2022-11-26,13:18:40

bitcoin,hey y'all long time lurker around these and other crypto related parts of reddit i figured this would be the best community to ask an hst question i have regarding self custody and its idealized future with the rece collapse of ftx the greater crypto community has been beating the drum of returning to the fundameals and the importance of not your keys not your crypto i s listening to an ierview on the breakdown with jesse powell of kraken this evening and he seemed to imply that the idea of keeping cash in a shoebox under your bed s some sort of perfect model for how people kept my in the past he s drawing the comparison to keeping cash under your bed in a shoebox in the old days and it felt he s romaicizing it the implication is that keeping your crypto in cold storage on a hardre is what every should be doing i do this i've e this since i understood the importance of it when i first got io crypto in early i i'm a baby i sn't affected at all by the collapse of ftx even though i'd purchased from them in the past self custody makes sense to me it's certainly of the values i ideify with and understand as importa to the space simply put we 't some ceralized organizations able to freeze our assets corol how we spend our my or in anyy affect our decisions surrounding it with all that being said here's my question if the idealized future of self custody is realized how does that look for the normal person and will it ever include the same conveniences assurances that large ceralized banks offer the idea of keeping cash under my bed is frankly ridiculous there's so many things that can go wrong my ho could be broken io and my shoebox taken i could lose the shoebox the shoebox could be taken by a family member if i ever to spend that my i have to go home and physically get the cash to spend it somewhere the list goes on virtually all the same problems exist today with cryptocurrency but to some degree they're even worse to spend some of my crypto i'd better have my physical hardre on me or i'd at least better have transferred some of it to a location that i can access it from the iernet what happens if my ho burns down maybe i stored my seed phrase in another location but that's kind of a lot to ask isn't it what happens if my hardre malfunctions what happens if the company that owns the hardre pushes a bad firmre softre update sure i can alys restore that with my seed phrase but holy shit what a painful process not to meion the learning curve on all of it is certainly non trivial i'm a softre engineer a lot of the ieractions iuitively makes some sense to me i won't get too much io how the expectation of asking some non technical year old person is fairly ridiculous i imagine a lot of that will be ird out over the years as we find a more seamless y to set s up and ieract with them i my question to focus around is there a world where self custody is ever as convenie as trusting some ceralized agency with a massive infrastructure and the motivation for people to spend my is convenience and to a certain degree security fraud protection insurance etc simply a trade off of having direct corol over your my or does crypto have some long term solution for that i'm just too close minded to imagine will i alys have to carry my hardre around with me just curious to hear from others thanks ,a question around the future of self custody,1.0,1,z3b6ek,pgowdy13,0,2022-11-24 05:18:48,1669267138,1669818724,2022-11-24,05:18:48

bitcoin,hi all apologies for the long post but i'm just doing some thought experimes and this s of them i 't have enough ledge about the mining side of btc to go through with this but my question is pretty much the title and i'd to see what others and hopefully some reasonings on why this isn't an issue below are some assumptions behind the reasoning of this thought i understand the chances are incredibly low for all of these things happening but i'm still curious to and i it would be a good discussion i'm also are of the difficulty adjustme per poi but bear with me so i'm assuming btc price stays low suppressed miners get priced out due to unprofitability a lot and i mean a lot of miners stop mining within a short time horizon to preve further losses i e multiple large mining pools stop mining so much so that there are far too many blocks uil the next difficulty adjustme now there are a fraction of the miners left on the network tasked with solving blocks but the hash rate has been reduced heavily resulting in a disproportid difficulty level to hash rate blocks are then solved incredibly slowly and require a heavy amou of energy input and cost to solve still resulting in a poteial loss even if we assume miners would receive a higher subsidy said another y i'm assuming that although less miners would be eitled to more of the block rerds aka would make it more profitable for them this increase in rerds is offset by the large increase in cost to solve the block removing any additional profitability and keeping them in a loss positiohis then leads me to a few question what the title is asking is the mining difficulty adjustme calculation weighted more tords the near term and would it help solve this issue after slowly solving the remaining blocks well above the desired average minute blocktime i'd appreciate any good resources on learning about the difficulty adjustme can something this be mitigated is it crucially importa for the average block to be solved every minutes what happens if became block per hour or worse than that i would this is importa as it helps preserve the security of the network and to keep the costs to attack the network high via double spending or making a longer manipulated chaihat's the exte of my thoughts and questions i'm no expert probably clear to some of you haha but ed to ask anyy thanks ,can bitcoin fail or face a lot of difficulty if mining difficulty gets too high and miners get priced out due to unprofitability or some other cause ,1.0,1,z29jlz,sigsysigs,0,2022-11-23 00:01:09,1669161685,1669819074,2022-11-23,00:01:09

bitcoin,as online merchas experime with crypto and start accepting crypto paymes they are often irigued by the idea of accepting multiple cryptocurrencies but as time goes by most of them often realize that there is really no real benefit of doing so and the best crypto to accept is bitcoin it is the only crypto that has the most r base and the only that is still standing today and will in the future even many crypto payme gateys for some reason also it's lucrative to offer crypto options for their rs but it's actually disadvaageous for online merchas who start accepting shitcoins on their webstores only to see their value drop or go to zero suddenly in the long run the safest bet is bitcoin whenever people ask me what's the best route to start accepting crypto my advice is alys to start with bitcoin and take it from there and gateys that are noncustodial and 't ask for kyc if privacy is a concern there are many payme gateys that make it simple for online merchas to start accepting bitcoin on their online stores and 't ask for id docs such as blockonomics gourl and btcpay server starting simple is alys the best y and experimeing with too many altcoins especially without prior ledge is risky ,with time most online merchants are realizing the benefits of accepting bitcoin in their online stores and dumping other altcoins ,1.0,1,z1t910,primalfabric,0,2022-11-22 13:11:46,1669122723,1669819249,2022-11-22,13:11:46

bitcoin,for a hyperbitcoinized future to be viable every needs to be able to lightning for the vast majority of their transactions and the chain for massive purchases if on chain is a vault and lightning is the you lk around with easy transition between the two modes without sacrificing the ierconnected nature of the ln is critical the loop feature that lightning labs has developed needs to be standardized and widely available to all or at least a varia of it i suspect that this vision of the future would have the bulk of on chain activity being loop processing idea that i've been kicking around that i would some feedback on is for lightning nodes to be able to both cooperatively close and open a lightning channel in a single transaction the two parties would esseially be refreshing the channel but more importaly or both of them could have additional inputs to increase the size of the channel or additional outputs for moving off the channel this same functionality could allow a service provider that manages multiple nodes with well connected channels to have an arbitrary number of single signer inputs sign funds io the refreshed channel and then routed back to them a loop in and multiple outputs that come from lightning paymes to be se back out a loop out the overall size of the channel then would have a net change of the amou looped in vs out this should be possible to code without changing anything on chain merely an addition or change to the bolt specification to allow for this kind of refresh thoughts ,loop needs to be a standard on the lightning network,1.0,1,z1aecv,seeker0003,0,2022-11-21 21:11:52,1669065123,1669819435,2022-11-21,21:11:52

bitcoin,first of all i believe in the future of bitcoin and dca weekly as an investme however there seems to be huge weaknesses that i'd to learn more about from this community to satisfy my naivete storage it's complicated 't hold your coins in an exchange not your keys not your coins etc if the goal is world adoption then i feel the barrier of ery is pretty high for people to safely store coins they have to buy on a trusted exchange then transfer them to a hardre where they are difficult to spend when the r is ready to many this process is confusing and expensive is there something i'm missing here loss of coins there will only ever be million coins however any r that is safely storing off an exchange risks total loss if they forget lose their keys that is a huge risk sure less coins in circulation may increase the value of those that remain but on a long enough timescale all could be poteially lost i suppose hiding cash in your mattress uil your ho burns down is a comparable emple but that seems far less ly than losing your keys ,please address my perceived weaknesses of bitcoin,1.0,1,z18v31,psychedelic_dolphin,0,2022-11-21 20:11:36,1669061514,1669819449,2022-11-21,20:11:36

ethereum,although i have high hopes for blockchain gaming there are certain evide problems that might limit widespread adoption and give the pe nft gaming industry more negative publicity i would add to the list some of these issues most people say that nft games are not fun i s of them uil i started checking out coinfaasy or gods unchained it's true that there have been a ton of game tokens and releases in the nft space recely and many of them look garbage with very questionable gameplay it becomes tough to keep gamers engaged when the gameplay is extremely repetitive and there are less than minutes of it people just stop playing the game when they stop making my overall the majority of curre pe games feel more a job with the worst kind of grind would you agree how about a high ery barrier the majority of casual players simply cannot pay the admission cost it cas two related problems first the game is inaccessible to regular rs which hinders long term r growth second investors are typically traders rather than gamers the developers receive little input when the investors 't actually play the game and the game gradually dies poor tokenomics is probably of the common issues traders buy nfts and hire gamers scholars to play the game using these nfts scholars make my in the form of native crypto tokens investors and gamers dump the token on new investors however once new investors stop to join the game there is no exit liquidity for curre investors we all that traditional gamers hate nfts but i believe that of the problems is that investors have unrealistic expectations despite the fact that there are many problems with this sort of gaming in general i believe that we should give it a try beca there are many faastic games what do you about all of the problems i've meid will they soon be resolved that in my opinion is the crucial eleme that will allow games to advance even further ,what are the main problems pe games need to solve to become mainstream ,1.0,1,109c9sd,turtlepajama,0,2023-01-11 18:41:06,1673462476,1673462477,2023-01-11,18:41:06
ethereum,and from this i understand that a transaction between eoa_a and a smart coract can trigger transfers of token from the eoa_a that se the transaction to another eoa_b but this transfer of token between eoa_a to eoa_b is not recorded on the blockchain my question now is if is ierested in tracking and be alerted by all activities on an accou how will do this for emple if i to be notified when tokens are transfered to eoa_b given the fact that the token transfer from eoa_a to eoa_b does not show up in any transaction how can i be notified based on my ledge y could be to listen to transfer eves on smart coracts but follow up questions as far as i understand it is possible for a smart coract to impleme the transfer methods without emitting the transfer eve not good practice but nothing stopping this from happening which makes me this approach of listening to the transfer eve might not be fool proof the transfer method and transfer eves are standardized part of erc token but i can imagine that there are other methods and operations peculiar to certain smart coracts not standardized but that will also lead to token transfer from eoa to another so that means an approach of listening to just the transfer eve will miss these kinds of token moveme so again the question how can track all eves' especially token and eth transfers in and out of an eoa given the technical drawbacks i listed below are there some ledge about the workings of ethereum that i do not about that could make this possible ,how to track for certain all addresses affected by a transaction ,1.0,1,109816k,finlaydotweber,0,2023-01-11 15:54:16,1673452469,1673452470,2023-01-11,15:54:16

of the poteial benefits and downsides of those choices with this ledge we can analyze the design choices made so far we observe how the european ceral bank ecb is going full steam ahead with their cbdc we come to the shocking discovery that the most importa design choices have already been made and that there have even been companies hired to start programming next we analyze what is happening in the us the us federal reserve fed is not as far advanced with their cbdc as the ecb however their frank report reveals that their cbdc design choices result in similar corol mechanisms as that of the ecb and it even exposes possible sinister motives to put it bluly what ceral banks are choosing for design so far tells us all we need to about where this is heading authorities are downplaying what is going on and pretending that all is open for debate and subjected to the democratic process but the designs they are secretly pushing forrd open the door to the dystopian future we all fear lt what are ceral bank digital currencies _before we can coinue we have to define cbdcs after all we already have digital my but cbdcs and what we currely as digital my are very differe things what we currely refer to as digital my is not issued by the ceral bank in the modern financial system the ceral bank only creates my in the form of cash bills and coins and cash deposits with banks all other my is created by private banks that s right the digital my currely in is created by private institutions the digital units in your bank accou are issued by a private bank cbdcs on the corary are digital public my issued by the ceral bank cbdcs are a totally new kind of my with many new features to summarize we go from two types to three types of retail my cash public my curre digital my private my curre cbdc public my new source ecb digital euro our future my note that cbdcs are esseially just differe forms of the same currency unit of cash is on par with unit of cbdc they are ierchangeable for reasons explained later these forms of my are also iended to exist alongside each other for the foreseeable future to summarize ceral banks are issuing a new version of my which is a liability of the ceral bank as such cbdcs are not just another form of digital my as public my they are more comparable to the other form of public my cash this begs the question why do we need an addition replaceme for cash lt why do we need cbdcs according to ceral banks _there is much debate on why cbdcs are being rolled out to avoid speculation we will stick with what the bis has said about why we need cbdcs this approach helps us to understand the decisions ceral banks have taken and what the logical outcome will be financial stability and the reduced role of public myover the past few years cash has become less popular this preses a problem beca as shown cash is currely the only form of public my d by the public retail and so when cash is phased out so is public my a principal concern of ceral banks is that if in the future cash were no longer widely accepted or available a severe financial crisis in the private financial system might create further havoc by disrupting day to day business and retail transactions cbdcs would be a y to keep the economy functioning mtary policyanother benefit of cbdcs touted by the bis is that they allow for a more direct influence on mtary policy argumes for issuing a cbdc include poteial strenhening of the pass through of the policy rate to my markets and deposit rates and helping to alleviate the zero or effective lower bound constrai the bis also argues for direct stimulus let s take a look at each benefit strenhening of the pass through of the policy rate means more corol over the ierest rates charged throughout the financial system ceral banks wish to bypass private banks and set rates directly from the mome that hoholds consider a cbdc to be an alternative to commercial bank deposits banks will have less scope for independely setting the ierest rate on deposits of the general public the zero lower bound describes the limit of negative ierest rates in short in an environme of increasingly lower ierest rates on bank accous people might pull their my out of the bank it is after all better to hold cash than my in an accou that charges deep negative ierest rates to address this issue the imf circulated a paper called breaking through the zero lower bound it explores the idea of having differe ierest rates for differe forms of my for emple an additional ierest rate on cash can very easily be charged on private banks through what is n as the cash window at the ceral bank the ceral bank charges the regular banks for the of cash and the banks then charge the rs through extra fees on withdrals and deposits this y the of cash can be made more expensive than digital forms of my this mechanism can be applied to steer the of differe forms of my and even be a stepping st on the road to a cashless society as you ll see later the imf s idea of differe ierest rates for differe kinds of my is vigorously embraced by ceral banks for emple the nigerian ceral bank d this idea to restrict cash shortly after iroducing their unpopular cbdc and finally according to the bis cbdcs could facilitate a more direct distribution of fiscal stimulus to those members of the general public who need it this could make such policies more effective than general helicopter my or distribution through the indirect and imperfect banking channels which have been d in the past financial inclusionanother buzzword ceral banks to is financial inclusion with a cbdc every could have access to basic financial services this would be especially ieresting for people not served by the curre financial system which is a situation more prevale outside the developed world but as alys much else in the diversity and inclusion agenda these rosy goals are mostly a facade of the most promine organisations behind financial inclusion is the united nations for whom the financial inclusion agenda allows the unlocking of public and private resources to fund their sustainable developme goals the un in turn coordinates its policies through the better than cash alliance an ngo acting as a fro for the ierests of among others the bill melinda gates foundation citi bank mastercard and visa inc in this light inclusive finance can be seen as the conversion of the unbanked io tax and debt serfs who pay transaction fees and serve as collateral for the financial system financial innovatiohe bis is discussing all sorts of other features all made possible by the idea of programmable my as we will see most of this innovation is in the ierests of ceral banks of the promised benefits of cbdcs is that it can make iernational paymes much more efficie and transpare beca these kinds of liabilities are being built from scratch cbdcs are billed as offering a unique opportunity to facilitate easier cross border paymes lt cbdc design choices_before we coinue it is importa to note that there have been few official decisions made as to how to move forrd the iroduction of a cbdc requires significa work and ceral banks are moving slowly in order not to break anything in this next section we look at the overviews the bis has made on designing cbdcs lots of research has been e across academia financial institutions and the ceral banks and the bis has created a nice summary of the design options it also reveals what the benefits and downsides of these design choices are with this ledge we can then look at the design decisions that have already been made by the ecb and fed and hence conclude what is happening behind the scenes tokens vs ideity basedfirst of all a choice has to be made as to whether the cbdc is to be token based or tied to an ideity through an accou according to the bis it has to be either or the other source bis quarterly review march a token based system would work other crypto currencies those with the private keys can spend the my but the drawbacks according to the bis are severe is the high risk of losing funds if end rs fail to keep their private key secret furthermore it would be challenging to design an effective regulatory framework for such a system law enforceme agencies would run io difficulties when seeking to ideify claim owners or follow my flows just as with cash or bearer securities in addition a token system would nullify the ceral bank objectives discussed above the other option is that the and ownership of a cbdc is accessible through an accou tied to an ideity similar to how the curre banking system operates to make this happen the bis calls for strong ideities for all accou holders where each individual is tied to ideifier across the eire payme system the disadvaages of an accou based system according to a paper of the bis are that you cannot have anonymity vis a vis the ceral bank and there cannot be private peer to peer transactions without an iermediary as is currely possible with cash see graph source bis committee on paymes and market infrastructures cbdcs direct or indirect liabilities the next question should people have an accou directly with the ceral bank or through iermediary financial institutions here the considerations are not just about what is desirable but also what is practically feasible currely ceral banks simply do not have the infrastructure to hold accous for hundreds of millions of citizens in addition there are regulatory obligations such as kyc and customer due diligence that ceral banks do not have the infrastructure and mandates for the most logical outcome would be for ceral banks to the existing financial companies to roll out cbdcs on a more technical level the question then becomes is the cbdc to be a liability on the balance sheet of the ceral bank or on the balance sheet of a financial iermediary with the latter option the cbdc would be an indirect liability of the ceral bank also n as a syhetic cbdc the bis does not this idea ceralized vs deceralizedanother choice needs to be made between using a deceralized settleme system or a ceralized firstly for regulators deceralized does not mean the same thing as it does to the industry they see it as a few regulated eities validating the settleme system moreover regular consensus mechanisms have too much overhead and are too slow for the large number of transactions needed an issue the bis has with a deceralized cbdc is that it means that a deceralized network makes adjustmes to the balance sheet of the ceral bank this increases the risks to the system according to the bis programmability of the main questions a ceral bank has to ask itself is whether it is going to create programmable my what is programmable my the us federal reserve provides a good definition a digital form of my and a mechanism for specifying the automated behavior of that my through a computer program this mechanism is termed programmability in this note across the pond in individual couries within the eu the need for programmable my is being debated however as you will see in the following sections programmability is an esseial part of cbdcs the ecb has even already released an api for institutions to start programming financial stability requiremesthe fact that cbdcs are going to be exchangeable for digital currencies results in some major risks to the financial system after all cbdcs make it easy to pull your my out of a private institution risk and deposit it with the ceral bank no risk if cbdcs could be freely traded the mome rumors spread that a bank is having issues all accou holders will convert their accou balances to cbdcs guaraeed by the ceral bank you could have insta bank runs and collapses in the financial system would happen as quickly as they do in the crypto space in addition adding cbdcs increases the total amou of my in circulation creates even more inflation at a time when people are already having problems paying their bills as a result any cbdc needs a built in mechanism to limit the amou of total cbdc that can be issued and limit how much can be exchanged for digital currency in short a programmable aspect of the cbdc has to come io play we will see later how both the ecb and fed are already committed to using financial stability as an exc to take full corol over how cbdcs can be held charged and exchanged mtary policy of the main activities of ceral banks over the last decade has been trying to manage the economy through mtary policy up uil now these ierveions have not alys been effective in kick starting the economy cbdcs can give the ceral banks when properly designed much more direct tools for implemeing mtary policy privacyprivacy is of the main concerns of regulators or at least it is the main concern for their poteial rs so this issue has to be addressed in the design of the coin it is worth noting that privacy means something differe for ceral bankers and for end rs in the crypto space it means that the technology makes it impossible for any to track your purchases from the poi of view of ceral banks privacy means that the organisations monitoring and facilitating your paymes are under constrais as to what they can and have to do with your data moreover ceral banks compare the privacy of cbdcs with data mining private financial service companies and with transactions being e on public blockchains they argue that in that light public institutions are better at safeguarding privacy for the design of a cbdc a ceral bank has to make a decision as to what level of privacy a coin will have taking io accou that full privacy is considered incompatible with other policy objectives such as kyc and aml compliance as we will see there are strong indications that privacy as it is understood by the crypto industry is not going to be built io the cbdc system ieroperabilityceral banks will have to make certain design choices such as whether foreigners are to be able to hold accous with the ceral bank or if there is to be some sort of exchange facility perhaps similar to what the crypto industry calls an atomic sp a coordinated cbdc design effort could take a clean slate perspective and incorporate cross border payme options right from the start private vs public chainon a final note investors in existing blockchains such as xlm or xrp have been publicly claiming that cbdcs will be built with their chain as the base layer this is simply not going to happen as previously meid cbdcs are liabilities on the balance sheet of the ceral bank there is no y that they are going to base this on an existing blockchain beca it would mean they would have to take full corol over the network now that we understand the differe design choices available we can look behind the scenes at how ceral banks are applying them starting with the ecb lt the digital euro ecb design choices_to understand the process of the creation of the digital euro we have to recap how the eu works this is well described by todd huizinga a former american diplomat to the eu he explains in detail that the eu is run by elites who wish to create an ever closer union regardless of the desires of the populations of individual eu couries as a result the eu has created a culture where policies are preseed as still being debated and subject to democratic principles whilst in fact behind closed doors the direction is being agreed upon in backroom deals the same seems to apply to the eu s cbdc the digital euro the design and building of the digital euro is at an advanced stage while officially nothing has been decided the reality however is that the issuing of the euro and logically also the design of the digital euro is delegated to the european ceral banking system and as you will see in the remainder of this section the digital euro train left the station a long time ago with funding already secured and companies being hired to build the required infrastructure as it stands now legislation is to be finalized in q and only in q will the decision on the digital euro be formally approved note that by then the design will be finished the design choices of the digital euroin the ecb published their report on the digital euro it sees the future euro as a safe digital asset with advanced functionalities and with profound implications for key areas of ceral banking for the broader economic and financial system and ultimately for the life of european citizens the digital euro would be first of all another y to supply euros convertible at par with other forms of the euro a digital euro will be a liability of the eurosystem and therefore by definition risk free ceral bank my programmabilitythe digital euro should keep pace with state of the art technology at all times in order to best address the needs of the market among required attributes are usability convenience speed cost efficiency and programmability it should be made available through fro end solutions throughout the eire euro area and should be ier operable with private payme solutions programmability is going to be required for a number of desired features there are going to be corols on how much my can be exchanged between differe forms of the euro differe ierest rates on differe forms of the euro and limits on what can hold and or transact in crisis situations there will ly be a maximum amou of cbdc which can be held by person at no additional cost in terms of mtary policy the digital euro should be remunerated at ierest rate s that the ceral bank can modify over time and with differe ierest rates applied in differe cases to get an idea of how much digital euros each accou owner is allowed to own before being faced with restrictive measures such as negative ierest rates the dutch ceral bank suggests that euro should be enough for most dutch citizens as it represes moh s living expenses and a financial buffer for unforeseen expenses next to the accou features there is work being e on special payme instructions such as paymes e between machines in short the digital euro is going to be programmable and not in a y that improves financial freedom accou based access and the digital ideitythe bis report taught us that ceral banks can issue a token or an accou based system the ecb indeed discusses both as possible options a pure bearer token system as exemplified by regular crypto currencies would take ay the corol of the ecb thus according to the ecb such a system can only be allowed when both rs are uniquely ideified for emple with biometrics e g fingerpri and iris recognition the accou based system on the other hand would be operated in the same y as the curre banking system this is the preferred system of the ecb where they operate the back end while existing supervised iermediaries operate the fro end as we see shortly financial service providers have already been hired to build this system as we speak the infrastructure for the digital euro is being built along with an eu wide digital id this digital id governed by the eidas regulation aims to help business citizens and public authorities carry out electronic ieractions this digital id will coain your releva data such as name address biometrics driver s licence medical data and will be d to facilitate transactions open bank accous online shopping financial services such as insurance and god s what else this digital id s approved in early december but the cbdc s already being built and funded long before that ceral or deceralized corolthe ecb s report repeats the bis s options of having a deceralized settleme system however the ecb is not going for this model they state that the ceral bank will corol the back end and has corol over all the units that are to be created other possible featuresother design options are discussed such as the possibility for hardre wearables virtual cards with additional features such as shorter expiration date and spending limits and a pan european mercha solution privacy only for low value transactions the above stateme is from a more rece letter by fabio panetta the driving force behind the digital euro according to him the ecb will explore if they can allow some anonymity in the system the ecb is addressing privacy in response to a public consultation where the ecb asked european citizens what they thought of a european cbdc it received an avalanche of negative responses and privacy s the most cited worry but the statemes of the ecb on privacy are coradictory in public officials tout it as an importa feature but if you then look at their most rece iernal preseation on privacy they explain that r anonymity is not a desirable feature as this would make it impossible to corol the amou in circulation and to preve my laundering the truth is that a gradual shift to digital paymes implies less privacy by default the ecb suggests that the digital euro should be designed so that the eurosystem should only be able to see the minimum transaction data however they are settling the transaction and will need to who is paying what to whom it is quite clear that privacy is not built io the system the ecb suggests that some privacy can be allowed for certain low value paymes and offline functionality however higher value transactions would remain subject to standard corols lt programming the european cbdc ecb softre package_on the th of december the ecb published a package for financial iermediaries to start building applications for the digital euro the publication coained cover letters confirming the design choices discussed above but also a softre package with the application programming ierface api a set of defined rules that explain how the computers of banks are to communicate with those of the ceral bank source ecb website digital euro api package this package provides a programming standard for banks and payme providers that serve the general public it allow them to process paymes digitally while the eurosystem settles the paymes the ecb is testing a system where iermediaries get to program differe kinds of transactions five companies have been selected to build softre iegrations on a settleme layer hosted by the ecb each will test a differe type of transaction as an annex to the article can download the code of the actual api from the source code a number of additional conclusions can be drawn about the model currely being pursued the digital euro will have iermediaries deal with clies and the ecb ultimately settling all the transactions the iermediary creates the payme the eurosystem approves and then a callback confirms the details of the transaction with details on the time and date it settled despite the non stop bashing of bitcoin by the ecb the curre proposal s the same technology utxo pub private signatures and even the same security model secpk as bitcoin the ecb is literally creating a bitcoin rip off and may even be re using open source bitcoin code the ecb will respond to every payme request with either settled or failed meaning that it has the ultimate corol over what paymes do and do not get approval it is unclear what conditions would result in a failed payme given the large number of transactions the ecb will have to process and the risk of running complex softre at a settleme layer it is hard to imagine the ecb programming payme conditions for specific cases however running a payme through a sanctions list or a list with basic conditions might be feasible moreover it seems ly that programming features will be enforced at the layers above the settleme layer for emple the ecb is working on a dedicated programmability platform layer between the settleme layer and the iermediary layers source ecb programmable paymes in digital euro the documeation explains how iermediaries create addresses on behalf of their clies it is only this address the ecb sees the more sensitive accou details are kept with the financial service provider this is explained as safeguarding privacy however a permane record of all transactions is stored all the ecb needs to do is match a name to each address and it sees everything it is as of yet unclear how mtary and financial stability objectives are going to be coded io this system it also is not clear how the ecb aims to reconcile the coradiction of limits on accou balance and their privacy goals the latest ecb progress update does not alleviate these worries it states that for online paymes the eurosystem itself will record transactions and perform associated verification tasks and it happens to be that online paymes are the category of paymes with the broadest set of high level cases now ask yourself how large a share of paymes in a digital currency will be e online in any case it is safe to assume there is not going to be real privacy in this system beca with this design either the ceral bank or the iermediary s the ideity of the rs behind each transaction us federal reserve design of the digital dollar_compared to the ecb the american ceral bank the federal reserve is not as far advanced with designing their cbdc however in january the fed did release their report my and paymes the u s dollar in the age of digital transformation in the opening paragraphs the fed repeats the familiar take that cbdcs are a differe kind of my compared to existing forms and states that in their opinion a cbdc is a digital liability of the federal reserve that is widely available to the general public it would be the safest digital asset available to the general public with no associated credit or liquidity risk the report pois to the fact that the federal reserve act does not allow direct federal reserve accous for individuals the fed will therefore have to adopt an iermediary model where the private sector would offer accous or digital s to facilitate the manageme of cbdc holdings and paymes just as with the ecb you will not have an accou directly with the fed but although commercial banks and non banks would offer these services to individuals the cbdc itself would be a liability of the federal reserve further on the fed argues that a future cbdc should be iermediated widely transferable and ideity verified while at the same time being privacy protected these are again coradicting objectives as a case the fed notes that governmes could a cbdc to collect taxes or make benefit paymes directly to citizens additionally a cbdc could poteially be programmed to for emple deliver paymes at certain times again programmable my additionally a cbdc could poteially be d to carry out micro paymes and streamline cross border paymes by using new technologies crucially the fed recaps the risk unlimited of cbdcs poses to the stability of the financial system as such the fed also proposes the variation of ierest rates on differe kinds of my and limits on the amou an end r could hold moreover to preve a flight to safety it proposes limits to the amou a r could accumulate in a short period of time and last but not least the fed discusses its mtary policy and the need to expand its balance sheet to accommodate cbdc growth part of this could be mitigated by shifting ay from existing non reserve liabilities yes the fed is suggesting withdrawing cash to make room for cbdcs new york fed testing of wholesale cbdcsthere were a number of rece headlines reporting that the new york fed had started a week test of their first cdbc however this project is mostly about exploring the concept of a wholesale cbdc this is a form of cbdc that is only d to settle the liabilities of regulated financial institutions although ieresting it does not tell us much about the future of retail cbdcs which are the main subject of this report fednow payme systemfednow is another project under developme by the fed that is sometimes confd with a cbdc this facility will enable individuals and businesses to send insta paymes between accous while the idea of insta settleme reminds us of crypto currency what is settled are not ceral bank liabilities as such fednow is not a cbdc system lt conclusion the cbdc prison being built_ceral banks around the world have started building cbdcs these need to be designed and each design has consequences when looking at the design choices made so far we can see where things are headed and it doesn t look good as of now no formal decisions have been made in the jurisdictions discussed regardless the eu s direction seems clear perhaps the us congress still has a say in the future of my we shall see what we see in the works is a system where small groups of unelected people get to approve all paymes there will be no privacy it has purposefully designed features that corol how much my you can hold and what kind of charges and negative ierest rates apply a system of consta surveillance and the ceralization of sensitive information and then we haven t even talked about all the other policies increasingly being enforced through the financial system such as a personal co budget or other social credit systems the re directing of private resources tords public policy goals blended finance and the exclusions of political undesirables cbdcs replace cash with a kind of my you never legally own you can directly be charged ierest and fees on and cannot spend without permission do you this sources this posts is larger than characters so i removed the footnotes from this post full list of footnotes can be found here download this article in pdffor a pdf version of this article to store or share click tldr cbdcs are liabilities directly with the ceral bank they are a new kind of my next to cash and digital my currely held in private banks the bank of iernational settlemes made an overview of all research io cbdcs it shows that each design has consequences the ecb has chose for a design where iermediaries deal with the clies but the ecb settles all paymes there is no real privacy in the system to ensure financial stability the ecb wishes to maiain corol over accou balances apply variable ierest charges and mtary policy stimulus the digital euro is in a far stage of developme the federal reserve act forces the fed to go through iermediaries as well the digital usd will be programmable and ideity verified to ensure financial stability the fed wishes to maiain corols on ierest charges and maximum accou balances the fed also argues that cbdcs might have to replace cash to maiain a healthy balance sheet the digital usd appears to not be in a far stage of developme , the truth about cbdcs design choices by ecb amp fed analysed both are aiming at tight control over accounts interest and spending a digital prison is being built in the shadows due diligence ,1.0,1,105sexf,decentralizedlaw,0,2023-01-07 16:02:25,1673107356,1673107356,2023-01-07,16:02:25

ethereum,hi i have this particular case and would to share it so people can recommend any solution besides building the solution myself so here it is i to keep some usdc or busd under a multi sign which requires signatures to spend the funds of signatures but i can see a couple of issues with only having parties and needing signatures to perform anything with any funds in that multi sign first death second separation of the parties involved and a need to return funds to each party death if of the two parties dies during the duration of this trust of funds the remaining party needs to go through and recover the other party's to do anything with the funds which is an annoyance at best separation let's say any of the involved parties to stop putting my io this trust fund again is that the name of this thing and leave with their corresponding share of the my but the other party doesn't to sign anything which freezes the funds uil the dispute is settled and worst case scenario n of the parties does what the other part asks and a judge gets involved to resolve the conflict then some solutions come to mind solving both particular edge cases at the same time involving a third party that plays the role of arbitrator it could be a lawyer who represes both parties but these cost my and you need to trust the lawyer to do the right thing to me what comes to mind is a smart coract is cheaper than a lawyer and you can write if you what you are doing to do the right thing but a smart coract can corol of the funds and do whatever n of m signatures requests right i wonder if a smart coract can be a signer party in a multi sign my reasoning for that is that the n of m smart coract signers corol of the funds if some smarter than the person writing the coract to exploit a bug the attacker won't get anything of value beca he still needs other signers to participate in the hack of the signers in this case okay so the question is there something this out there in ethereum that can be d for cheap and with a froend that won't banish suddenly or do i need to build it myself ,a piggy bank with stablecoins in ethereum using multi signature wallets ,1.0,1,zzlf83,shackra,0,2022-12-31 04:33:31,1672461226,1672461226,2022-12-31,04:33:31

ethereum,i have been ing a lot lately about key manageme and fund recovery it occurred to me that we could create a system that allows us to recover funds from lost keys by signing time bound transactions which can sweep our funds in the eve that we lose access in a nutshell this works by signing a transaction that deploys a coract which sends funds to another address this could be a friend family member or even your exchange and setting time constrais such as not valid before and or not valid after you can also sign many of these transactions with multiple nonce values so that you still have a valid transaction in the eve that you make future transactions since this signed transaction is constrained to the recipie and certain time criteria it is not sensitive and can be stored anywhere including on the cloud as a r you have the power to invalidate the transactions at anytime by either spending the funds or using up all the nonces i have started creating a prototype here let me what you of the concept and how you would improve it merry christmas ,idea how we could create timelocked transaction backups to recover ether from lost keys,1.0,1,zu2vvy,bitman321,0,2022-12-24 05:39:21,1671860376,1671860376,2022-12-24,05:39:21

ethereum,eof is the biggest upgrade in the evm's history coming in the shanghai fork in march eof will completely change how ethereum works here's a summary eip the first upgrade in eof changes how instructions to the evm are structured specifically it establishes a structure where didn t really exist before it splits bytecode io two strings of characters coaining code and the other coaining data this eip also makes it easier to upgrade the evm it creates a system to distinguish new coracts and what features each is using the evm executes each program based on the version of the evm it s released in so new upgrades can be delivered more easily eip this iroduces the concept of code validation specifically when a smart coract is deployed coracts today aren t validated by the ethereum network before they re deployed they get validated as they re executed by people validating coracts upon deployme saves significaly on execution costs programs are validated once upon deployme and any necessary data for operation is made available in the data section of the bytecode eip quick tange stack machines can be imagined as glass coainers tall and thin they execute instructions and store data in these glass coainers the first piece of data is placed at the bottom and everything afterrds gets placed on top in a stack stack machines have poiers that can move between pieces of data to read them the y ethereum shift its poier today is with a jump which requires a destination or a jumpdest eip 's new opcodes enables the ethereum stack machine to shift its poier far more efficiely this results in cheaper gas fees both for deploying a coract as well as for ieracting with it also makes on chain analysis easier eip this iroduces functions that the stack itself can perform functions are instructions that need to be performed more than once in a program writing such instructions once as a function makes programs more efficie leading to cost savings on ethereum currely functions t exist at the bytecode level that the stack machine executes on ethereum to repeat instructions the jump and jumpdest opcodes are instead d to shift the poier to where an instruction is when it needs to be executed eip this eip focs on validating coracts upon deployme but by looking for errors the stack machine might encouer called stack overflows or underflows stack overflow when a stack is out of space stack underflow retrieving data from an empty stackdespite stack overflows and underflows being basic errors they can occur on ethereum today the checks to preve them are iroduced with this eip eof is a suite of eips together making evm execution more efficie more consiste and more easily upgradeable eof itself is first upgrade in the evm's history and can be expected in the shanghai hard fork in march if you'd to learn more read the full write up on my free newsletter below ,a simple explanation of eof evm object format,1.0,1,ztso6h,phillistine,0,2022-12-23 21:07:55,1671829689,1671829690,2022-12-23,21:07:55

ethereum,over the past few mohs ethereum's censorship issue has gotten worse as some validators in charge of maiaining the blockchain's ledger ignore specific transactions in order to adhere to rules purists of crypto's ai censorship moveme though may have ca for optimism i've read somewhere that of blocks added to the ethereum blockchain in the last day were ofac complia excluding transactions involving individuals or organizations blacklisted by the office of foreign assets corol of the u s treasury departme every week there are various concerns regarding cryptocurrencies the bear market solana's problems the ftx scandal and now this i miss the days when the only issue s high gas fees which we quickly resolved with metis polygon or any of these l protocols what s the problem with mev boost since september when we experienced ethereum merge the majority of blocks that are added to the blockchain go through mev boost a piece of middlere that enables validators those who add and approve blocks of transactions to ethereum's ledger to request already made blocks from a community of builders initially the purpose of mev boost s to aid validators in obtaining mev or maximum extractible value which refers to the extra revenue that blocks builders and validators can earn by carefully rearranging or inserting transactions within a block as i heard others attribute the decline in censorship to the fact that validators are more willing to connect to relays that are not flashbots now that they have become more comfortable with the mev boost space what do you how will solve and do we need to worry about this ,should we be concerned about the censorship issue with ethereum ,1.0,1,zrpc30,finley_dz,0,2022-12-21 14:59:20,1671634771,1671634772,2022-12-21,14:59:20

ethereum,i ed to share a thought i had about how putting stocks on the blockchain could help stock exchanges in less liquid markets attract investmes and improve the lives of those in the region and the best part is it could all be e while encouraging transparency and giving liquidity providers a new y to invest in the stock market so what do i mean by less liquid markets these are stock exchanges in regions or couries where there isn't as much trading activity this can make it difficult for companies to raise the capital they need to grow and succeed and it can also make it hard for investors to find good opportunities but by putting stocks on the blockchain these exchanges can poteially attract more investme from around the world the transparency and security of the blockchain can make it easier for investors to feel confide about putting their my io these markets and for the companies listed on these exchanges it can provide a new source of funding and a y to tap io a global investor base but it's not just about attracting more investme by bringing more activity to these exchanges we can also help to improve the lives of those in the region when companies are able to raise the capital they need they can create jobs drive economic growth and coribute to the overall well being of the community and for automatic market maker liquidity providers this could be a fun and exciting new y to invest in the stock market instead of just being limited to the major exchanges they can now poteially access a whole new world of opportunities and help to drive liquidity in these less liquid markets ,putting stocks on the blockchain from less liquid exchanges,1.0,1,zqux41,godking99,0,2022-12-20 17:56:33,1671559007,1671559007,2022-12-20,17:56:33

ethereum,been researching and adding up my stake in xmr and bch but eth is catching my eye a bit more however the previous two coins are proof of work which i i understand the pros and cons of well enough proof of stake on the other hand has me getting pretty mixed feedback and i'm not sure what to as there appears to still be much uncertaiy about the pros cons of pos vs pow from what i gather some thoughts are pros more energy efficie not inherely a bad thing to a lot of energy but a lot of energy s mined in china which s less clean sources such as coal or natgas faster lower time complexity and all that more scalable as less computation power is required that means it can run much more smoothly as eth is something of an investme rather than something backed by computation cons more beneficial to ceralization and the rich by the model though i will note this arguably applies to pow as any oligarch who ed to take over could pay some with technical expertise to set up their own rigs and pay them a commission or something that allowing poteially for censorship and coopting whether by force or by a attack less secure validators could be bribed more threatened by censorship than pow coins i for governme has no role to play in the creation or regulation of my and that no man should have corol over it in other words i support the separation of state and my for the good of the masses mixed neutral still has high gas fees case is defi rather than outright cash though in theory perhaps it could be d for that as well bch is trying to get io defi as well from my understanding so perhaps eth could do something in the other direction is this correct are the cons overstated i less about pos and eth defi in general than i do pow or the coins meid above all feedback appreciated ,how has the transition to pos gone so far ,1.0,1,ze4vr4,lordigorbogdanoff,0,2022-12-06 12:04:19,1670328270,1670328270,2022-12-06,12:04:19

ethereum,why do you play or do you avoid blockchain games what is there to or dis i've been wondering since there are not as enough players as there should be how can crypto gaming ecosystems become more resilie some critics say blockchain games aren't fun to play beca they focus on mtization too much would you agree with that that is certainly true for some of the first generation blockchain games where developers were clearly more concerned with the crypto earning aspect than with actual gameplay value since then developers have realized that maiaining a sustainable blockchain gaming ecosystem necessitates more than just the ability to earn it necessitates an engaging core game design and gameplay mechanics that can keep players hooked and spending time on the game in addition to a simple desire to earn i played numerous of these games beca i'm a huge fan of video games and i'm alys eager to try something new there are only a few that made me eertained splierlands m tournames and axie but only at the beginning some pay to win games are based on unsustainable tokenomics another common criticism leveled at the earlier generation of play to earn games is that they attract players based on ponzinomics in which the earnings of players who joined the game earlier are depende on the ability to sell nfts or tokens to new players how do devs expect them to have more gamefi players when most people are not familiar with basic crypto terms ,some critics say blockchain games aren't fun to play because they focus on monetization too much,1.0,1,z12pno,the_phallus_of_joy,0,2022-11-21 16:08:17,1669046911,1669819518,2022-11-21,16:08:17

ethereum,did you ever about how people decide on nft prices or how you price nfts i've been wondering how some nfts make my when they sell for as little as and people pay exorbita fees that's why i've been ing about this question markets for nfts began to gain traction in and by the end of march this new market for digital assets had a total lifetime traded volume of approximately million some of the frequely asked questions are how does price their art and what is the best strategy for selling nfts despite the lack of predefined pricing strategies for nonfungible tokens nft sellers may choose to sell them at the listing price in a secondary market alternatively they may complete the sale at a price that a buyer is willing to pay referred to as the buyer price beca of this gaming nfts are the easiest to deal with nfts can be rerded with battle gameplay armor weapons or who s what as in m tournames as you can see i'm more ierested in gaming nfts so i'm not sure how pricing works for differe types of nfts even so i believe that if you set your price too high you risk never being able to sell that item and that if you set your price too low gradually raising it will be more difficult what are your opinions ,i've been wondering how some nfts make money when they sell for as little as and people pay exorbitant fees,1.0,1,yubpt6,finley_dz,0,2022-11-13 19:41:30,1668368503,1669822002,2022-11-13,19:41:30

ethereum, definitiohe blockchain is operated based on a plurality of nodes configured in a pp method couless transactions are submitted mome by mome from clies all over the world tords couless nodes spread all over the world the results of these transactions are recorded on all nodes and in particular the coes should be the same overall in order to realize this the rule that all nodes must follow is the consensus algorithm to describe it more conceptually it can be defined as a method in which a specific node is selected by a certain rule especially by the deceralization principle the selection and execution order of transactions is determined by the selected node and other good willed nodes independely verify and execute the coes of individual transactions and store them in their database as such consensus algorithms can be clearly defined however many people are misunderstanding this definition the subject of consensusthere is a serious misunderstanding about it of the general public misunderstands this poi and most of the dapp programmers who have not built the mainnet themselves are misunderstood or ambiguous this is even shown on ethereum's official website there is no understanding of the definition of the consensus algorithm meid above or it is ambiguous the fundameal ca of this problem is the illusion about the subject of consensus in short even though the coe of the transaction that's the autheicity of the author is not a subject of consensus it is often mistaken the only subjects of the consensus are the selection of transactions and the order in which they are implemeed a the coes of the transaction ectly the autheicity of the author the transaction that a sends eth to b is electronically signed with a private key and deployed to the blockchain network the autheicity of the transaction creator is judged by each of all pp nodes it doesn't get help from any outside and it doesn't ask any outside however most ordinary people and surprisingly many dapp programmers mistake the autheicity of the coe or the author's autheicity as the subject of consensus however this is not the subject of consensus but of ai consensus a famous pharase about this is the following do not trust verify as a result even if all other nodes in ethereum conspired to forge the transaction and store it in the database the hst node does not care about it at all and verifies the transaction by itself and stores it in its own database and new nodes joining afterrds will follow the hst node b selection and execution order of transactionsthese are the genuine subjects of consensus no more no less not all transactions submitted to the blockchain are selected and the selected transactions are not executed in the order in which they are submitted this is beca it is theoretically impossible as long as the concept of a block of finite capacity is premised therefore there arises a problem of deciding how many transactions to accept in block and in what order to execute them it is the problem of the consensus algorithm and in itself this becomes the definition of it i selection of transactionsfor emple assuming that suddenly billion transactions are pushed in second it becomes impossible to put them in block therefore we have no choice but to choose some of them in this case most mainnets collect transactions in the order of high gas prices and put them in blocks therefore even transactions submitted first in time may not be included in the block if the gas price is low they also run later than other transactions with high gas prices even if they are coained in blocks for reference the existing ceralized system solves this problem by creating a queue so even if a billion transactions suddenly hit in a second it can theoretically accept and process the whole transactions ii order of execution of transactionsthis is also usually determined based on gas prices maybe all the mainnets are doing that and i've never heard of that exception in this case it is natural that the possibility of manipulation occurs the answers of existing blockchain protocols to this are as follows code is law it means that you are responsible for not checking the law in advance this is simply an irresponsible attitude for emple if an incompete legislator incorrectly eered the amou of parking fines and added another zero the legislator is not at fault and you are an idiot for not checking the law this is the curre state of the blockchain in the dao crisis the law s eveually forced to be revised now it should be law is code the order of execution of transactions must be in the order in which they were submitted at least they should try to do that however the existing mainstream platforms insist that the curre gas price auction system is the right y offering only poor excs of course every s that it is a lazism the birth of the block conceptas described above the curre consensus algorithms have a fundameal problem nevertheless the reason satoshi and buterin adopted this method s to make ceralized manipulation impossible in the selection and execution order of transactions that's they sacrificed the general principle of pre submissionism to pursue deceralization by the y in order to pursue deceralization in the satoshi sense the order of selection and execution of transactions must be determined by a node rather than a specific node however if couless clies submit their transactions to a myriad of nodes the unity of the overall database will be broken if the transactions are executed in the order submitted for each node therefore he s forced to seek ys to select and order transactions by any random node and to allow other nodes to accept them to this end it is needed to establish rules on who will make decisions on selection and who will follow them as selected by a duly elected selection decision maker other nodes follow it and execute each transaction and store it in their own database thereby maiaining the overall database uniformity it s the pow that satoshi came up with as a y to determine who has the authority to make the above selection decision that means that the person who solves the high level math problem the fastest will be given the right to decide on the selection of transactions however in order to do this you need time to solve math problems and during that period the transaction queue is accumulated at this poi satoshi came up with the concept of the very block it is the miner who succeeds in solving the math problem satoshi established a rule that the miner selects all or some of the transactions accumulated during the period of solving mathematical problems puts them in block and executes them and all other nodes follow the rules the block concept of blockchain s born in this coext limitations of the meaning of deceralization in blockchainas such the block concept emerged as a methodical eleme to make it impossible to manipulate in the adoption and order of execution of transactions it s the best y within the limits of satoshi's ielligence the reason satoshi adopted the block concept s of course to achieve the idea of deceralization despite innumerable problems such as the execution delay of transactions during the block generation time the reversal of the transaction execution order and uncertaiy of being selected in the block satoshi believed that deceralization would be guaraeed if a node s selected from among the innumerable good willed nodes spread around the world and those nodes determined the selection and execution order of transactions and he thought that if only the deceralization s guaraeed he could endure a number of problems cad by block generation if so it is necessary to calmly emine the advaages of the deceralization compared to the ceralization system at the expense of such considerable costs for this it is good to make a comparison in other words it is assumed that there is ceralized node and that this node determines the selection and execution order of transactions and other nodes follow suit next the deceralization system is compared with this first there is no difference in the coe of the transaction whether it is a ceralization method or a deceralization method this is beca forgery is impossible thus the transaction in which a transfers bitcoin to b works ectly the same on these two systems and is also stored in the database in the same y it is also impossible for the ceralization system operator to produce the above manipulated transaction from the beginning and both systems are the same in this respect however there are differences between the two systems in the selection of transactions and in determining the order of execution the problem is that it is necessary to emine whether the difference is esseial or relative speaking from the conclusion the difference is only a relative difference and in particular in terms of fairness that is preveion of manipulation it can be said that there is nothing better than a ceralized system in a deceralized system let's look at this in detail the manager x of the ceralized system can arbitrarily manipulate the selection and execution order of the first transaction in which a transfers bitcoin to b and the second transaction in which a transfers bitcoin to c so if x hates b loves c and a's curre balance is bitcoin x can make the bitcoin which is normal to be transferred to b be transferred to c by manipulating the order of transactions or omitting the first transaction at all satoshi s are of the above problems and as a couermeasure he studied how to empower random node operators to decide the selection and order of execution of transactions the result of the study s mining and the concept that arose as an inevitable result of the mining s the block finally at first it seemed that satoshi's idea could be realized without obstacles if there are innumerable nodes and an arbitrary or random node operator determines the selection and execution order of the transaction it can be admitted that virtually no can manipulate it however the reality did not go as satoshi thought the first typical situation s the emergence of the mining king in china he s able to exert the power of the operator of a ceralized node to some exte based on the enormous hash power and most of all the critical scene s the dao incide ethereum foundation and a series of sympathizers have artificially manipulated the selection and execution order of the transactions to generate an artificial fork since then couless artificial forks have been implemeed in the blockchain ecosystem as a result satoshi's logic of deceralization has virtually collapsed as an inevitable result the block concept has now fallen io a relative rather than an absolute concept in the blockchain in fact even if it s not the chinese mining king or the dao crisis there s alys a possibility of manipulation by arbitrary node operators that is the case when a node operator is preparing to manipulate at that time in case he succeeds in mining if he prepares manipulated codes and allows the codes to be executed when he succeeds in mining or is selected as a validator he can manipulate them for emple with simple code manipulation it is possible to change the selection and order of execution of transactions in a low rather than high order of gas prices as such deceralization through mining and blocks s originally an incomplete method it s not a digital but an analog concept that is on a differe level from the absolute concept of the impossibility of forgery by electronic signature and this result applies equally to pos whether the stake is large or small a node operator can manipulate the selection and execution order of transactions as long as he is selected as a validator but the problems 't end here it's time to ask a more fundameal question is it reasonable to fundameally determine the selection and order of execution of transactions based on gas prices to say the conclusion in advance it is a manipulation in itself it's nothing more and nothing less than to benefit some who has offered more bribes let's look at it in detail in general it is right to execute the transaction received first for emple no matter how much remittance fees are offered to a bank it never changes the remittance order beca it is a principle of nature to process remittances in chronological order there is no reason to treat this principle differely in blockchain therefore if the order is to be reversed a corresponding unavoidable reason must be preseed satoshi's answer to this is as follows by extracting transactions in the order of higher gas prices the platform can preve infinite repetitive attacks this is not a reasonable preseation this is a simple security issue and a topic unrelated to deceralization that's it is not an issue to be considered in the stage of building the core of the blockchain that should be considered once the esseial structure of the blockchain is completed in other words in the core stage it is right to complete the basic structure so that the transactions are executed in chronological order therefore the infinite repetition attack problem should be considered in the process of considering various secondary problems of the basic structure that has been completed primarily in the process it is the right programming mindset to devise and install a new appropriate additional device separately also such a device is easily conceivable for emple you can find a lot of great methods even at the level of common sense such as conducting transactions in chronological order receiving costs in terms of security rather than gas and returning them if there are no problems later unfortunately it is assumed that satoshi did not have time to come up with such an idea as a result the gas costs were forcibly inserted io the core part of the blockchain under the wrong name that's the security costs were inserted under the name of gas costs the aftereffects of satoshi's decision on subseque blockchains were severe in conclusion satoshi's deceralized method could not achieve its original purpose the selection and execution order of transactions could be manipulated and more fundameally determining them based on the gas prices is just manipulation in itself the gas cost priority policy is an unusual manipulation against the common sense that the transaction received first should be implemeed first and the reason for that manipulation s also poor in conclusion it is inevitable to raise fundameal questions about satoshi's deceralization method that is the block method itself this is not just an issue for bitcoin but a problem for ethereum and all other blockchains disappearance of the blockif all transactions can coinue from beginning to end without manipulation and the database can be stored equally on all nodes the purpose of the blockchain is achieved a curious result emerges here that is the fact that the concept of a block is not necessary to achieve that purpose in addition the fact that n of the existing blockchains achieved the esseial purpose of the blockchains meid above perfectly at least satisfactorily makes us surprised that means that the block is a failed concept as shown by the comparison of the two systems above it cannot be guaraeed that the deceralized pp system of satoshi or ethereum has special advaages over the ceralized pp system instead by adopting a ceralized system but strenhening the devices that corol the ceral main node to preve ab of authority it is possible to make a more fair and unmanipulatable system than the existing deceralized system for emple a main node temporarily monopolizes the selection and execution of transactions and is forced to select and execute transactions in chronological order then the other nodes monitor it constaly and if it operates against principles disqualify it and appoi of the other standby nodes as the main node in any case both ceralized pp and deceralized pp cannot manipulate the coes of a transaction that's both methods already have solved the byzaine general problem the remaining issues are of what to select and how to set execution order but rather a ceralized system can operate them more fairly the transaction submited first is executed first and the gas costs may not be received at last we come to a final conclusion the concept of the block is removed as long as the transactions are executed in the order submitted there is no reason to divide and put them in blocks this is no differe from executing transactions in chronological order received by banks or credit card companies they no longer need the concept of blocks the concept of the block s only satoshi's desperate measure and it is by no means a logically necessary concept to achieve the purpose of the block chain and the most importa fact is that it is desirable to remove the concept of a block as much as possible therefore it comes to the conclusion that the block concept will eveually disappear the only thing that remains is the transaction chain now the blockchain must be renamed the transaction chain which will revolutionize the blockchain ecosystem the appearance of nonblockchainat least it is possible to remove the concept of blocks while maiaining the curre level of fairness of deceralization in bitcoin or ethereum more precisely it means that there are theoretically infinite ys to eliminate the concept of the block to improve the selection and execution order of transactions while securing fairness beyond the curre level of the fairness of deceralization in bitcoin or ethereum then what will the consensus algorithm look if the block concept is actually removed first of all the chain is made up of only transactions this transaction chain also has no fear of forgery at least in the coe of the transaction as long as pp is the premise there is no fear of forgery or falsification of the coes of a transaction whether it is on a ceralized or deceralized system if so the only thing left is the selection and order of transactions who will decide them this means going back to the poi when satoshi created bitcoin based on experience over the past years satoshi has failed on this issue for now therefore we must return to satoshi's initial starting poi even if we 't that and we have to start over from scratch what needs to be observed here is thing and that is enough that's the level of fairness must be above the curre level of bitcoin or ethereum complete fairness is impossible it's not impossible in theory but it's practically impossible unless an innovative new technology rsa emerges the easiest thing to about is appoiing a main node in appoiing the main node the status may be endowed permanely or only temporarily the most appropriate answer will be somewhere in the middle of the two it is virtually impossible to appoi and replace the main node only temporarily i e only once for each transaction satoshi s confroed with this very problem at that time satoshi imagined the concept of block and from this blockchain s born and years later it s confirmed that the concept of block s a failure in this case the most common sense that can be thought of is to appoi a main node under a certain standard and constaly monitor it as a method you may the platform's own code or you may a smartcoract and if manipulation or laziness of the main node is detected a method of replacing the main node automatically or by poll is iroduced even at this level the fairness is not inferior to the former chinese mining king or specific foundation led artificial fork creation above all this method has the advaage of being able to set the operating standards in advance in a smartcoract as a result arbitrary fork generation is fundameally blocked this is beca the fork generation principle itself that other nodes follow the longest blockchain has been removed then it can be said that it is relatively more fair than the existing deceralization system in the end that can be called proof of democracy pod deceralization which is less fair than pod is no longer deceralized eveually the religion of deceralization also collapses many people still believe in this myth it is superstition beca there is no technical basis the trustlessness has a technical basis called a electronic signature however there is no such definite technique for the permissionlessness an esseial eleme of deceralization as demonstrated above the block failed the deceralization has failed in both theoretical and practical ys therefore in this situation calling for deceralization is nothing more than calling for it as a simple ideology it is no more than a cry for th ceury anarchism deceralization without technical support is nothing more than a mere cry of ideology in reality pow and pos are also fundameally operated under the corol of pod they are no longer deceralized things let's look more specifically pow is not a mining certification method but a mining manipulation method as can be seen from china's mining king pos is also only a method that can be manipulated by stakeholders there is currely no technology or method to preve the manipulations the dao crisis and the numerous forks that have been conveniely attempted since then only prove that the blockchain is accepting democracy its ultimate bastion that is it may be seen that the pow or pos is only a kind of pod at prese in other words all existing consensus algorithms are pods pure deceralization independe of democracy does not currely exist therefore the method of selection and ordering of transactions can only be explored based on pod at prese advaages of nonblockchain satoshi's block ended in failure however it has since become the standard for all blockchains most blockchains fundameally do not deviate from satoshi's basic framework eveually all of them disappear or remain only for mum personally bitcoin's block will survive forever on the other hand ethereum is very unstable there is absolutely no reason to maiain the block concept in the ethereum c ethereum's attempt to maiain the curre block concept is an obvious long term impossibility nonblockchain has many advaages once you can stick to the principle that is transactions may be executed in the order of reception or submission as in the previous emple if the tree method with the main node as the top is applied transactions can be executed in the order received by the main node furthermore all transactions can be accepted without omission this is the same as the queue concept in a general computer os there is nothing special the nonblockchain would normally adopt a tree structure of course in preliminary the horizoal pp method of the curre blockchain may be adopted as an auxiliary method it depends on the mainnet developer's choice anyy if the tree structure is adopted it can boast the fastest speed theoretically there can no longer be a rapid structure the nonblockchain does not require a concept such as gas price to determine eligibility to be included in a block beca the concept of a block does not exist in the first place it is enough to accept and impleme in fact the gas costs of existing blockchains are virtually irreleva to the node's operating costs this is beca the execution of transactions and the storage of data are performed in all nodes but the gas costs are only probabilistically paid to miners or validators to be ect gas costs should be distributed fairly to all nodes in this respect the existing gas cost system is extremely unreasonable instead it is desirable to institutionalize a separate method of payme of operating expenses newly and that is possible but that will not be specifically meid here the real purpose of existing blockchains collecting gas costs is not for operating expenses the mining rerds are sufficie to pay operating expenses in fact the real purpose of the gas costs s security costs this is being confessed by ethereum's official site in short gas fees help keep the ethereum network secure by requiring a fee for every computation executed on the network we preve bad actors from spamming the network the nonblockchain collects security costs not gas costs if malicious ie is not positively recognized due to the review the collected gas costs will be returned in this y the security cost may be set high enough without resistance eveually by returning the gas costs they become zero as described above the advaages of the nonblockchain are considerable and there are no theoretical or practical obstacles to its adoption so of course the existing block concept must be discarded and a system consisting only of a pure transaction chain will inevitably emerge the nonblockchain consensus algorithm is bound to be pod for the time being for now we have no choice but to it for the emergence of consensus algorithms that can achieve deceralization in the true sense by a genius who will appear someday uil then it will only be in the form of a pod conclusiohe block s just satoshi's impromptu idea the necessity for hashes to be coiguous is only between transactions not between blocks as a result the name of the blockchain itself is meaningless the blockchain is only method proposed by satoshi to realize the ideology of the transactionchain the block is not the truth the block concept s only of the myriad ys to realize the transactionchain and it has now reached the poi of disposal the byzaine general problem s not solved by satoshi but s just a problem that had already been solved by cryptography it s the electronic signature looking inside the blockchain at the curre stage there are no particularly remarkable technologies other than the electronic signature other technologies are only those that have already existed or can be developed by ordinary programmers it is absurd to try to achieve deceralization with only such poor equipme in other words the crypto world at this stage does not have the ability to realize the ideals of blockchain as an inevitable result the consensus algorithm cannot go beyond pod this is the reality of today's blockchain but the spirit of commercialism s to hide these limitations on the other hand glorify the block to this end they feature the emperor's new clothes the represeative clothes are ethereum's future plans the complexity of this plan is indescribable the complexity s all cad by the concept of the block these are temporary complications that will all disappear when the block concept is removed or at least a fundameal platform that heals the problems appears for the time being of course they are successful in dazzling people ,the fictitiousness of the consensus algorithm the failure of decentralization and the emergence of nonblockchain the content is very long pre scrolling is recommended

ethereum,ethereum is a public ledger and by its design it s mea to be transpare however there is confusion about it being anonymous beca many people still believe that the blockchain in general is anonymous which is false anything can be tracked on the ledger including the details of every transaction and deal you ve made since you started trading it may not be a big deal to some especially to those who t understand that their personal privacy can easily be violated as a result of this people are starting to realize that there is a big privacy gap in crypto this has been lified by the disturbing push for the adoption of cbdcs by the governme which will give them some level of corol over the finances of the general masses zero ledge proofs have been cited by many to be revolutionary especially when it comes to building privacy tools zkps are encryption schemes in which a party who is a prover proves their case of truth concerning specific data on the other party a verifier without revealing the information here are few of the projects that have worked around the technology to build an importa utility privacy in crypto aztec offers rs privacy utilizing layer solutions specifically the zk rollups system rs send transaction requests to aztec and the transactions are then put io a batch and rolled up with other rs' transactions which can lead to a longer processing time but has privacy baked in at a base layer railgun is a privacy preserving smart coract developed on ethereum and s zk snarks to obfuscate transaction details and make anonymous transactions of any erc tokens or erc tokens rs also get privacy at rest meaning they can keep a private balance which sn t possible on previous l privacy protocols it works by removing all ideifying information from transactions it s similar to a metamask or any other just with privacy preserving zk snarks in place zether is a confideial transaction amous are hidden and anonymous transaction sender and receiver are hidden payme mechanism on blockchains with an accou model ethereum it is implemeed as a smart coract called zsc of the major limitations that zether is n for is that transactions get processed at the end of a curre epoch inferring that it can be quite difficult on a busy network however it is quite promising and has everything it takes to be among the major players in private crypto overtime i believe that there are many other ys to keep a private balance on ethereum as a privacy maxi i would love to hear this subreddit s thoughts on what s out there in this area a time will come when privacy will become a big word in crypto and we ll have the bulk of crypto rs keeping their on chain activities private ,zero knowledge proofs application in ethereum,1.0,1,yra2jk,jacobsendy,0,2022-11-10 09:25:37,1668072348,1669823101,2022-11-10,09:25:37

ethereum,ethereum is notorious for being prohibitively slow and costly at the height of cryptocurrency's most rece hype cycle something as simple as exchanging token for another on the blockchain could have cost uprds of it's no surprise that l protocols have grown in popularity so there are layer rollups for those who to keep their transactions within the ethereum ecosystem and there's a reason why metis and other l solutions have become so popular layer rollups have special systems in place to ensure that transactions aren't spoofed or altered before being se back to ethereum's main chain which is pretty cool in what l protocol do you believe the most and what fascinates you about it did you that the total value locked in ethereum's layer networks has surpassed billion ethereum's layer ecosystem is undeniably growing although the ethereum merge s the second most aicipated blockchain update this year ethereum supporters have long hoped that layer growth will help the ecosystem achieve mass adoption by lowering costs and making the network more accessible while ethereum mainnet coinues to hold the majority of the crypto ecosystem's capital with just under billion locked up layer appears to be catching up quickly ,ethereum's layer ecosystem is undeniably growing,1.0,1,ymrerz,finley_dz,0,2022-11-05 11:32:25,1667647956,1669824737,2022-11-05,11:32:25

ethereum,while many ethereum supporters blindly celebrate meta instagram s move to launch nfts on polygon they have been tricked and ignore that polygon is no l and does not benefit ethereum in its curre form polygon matic token has launched a vire attack on gullible ethereum rs investors by falsely labelling it as an layer solution and piggy backing off most of its infrastructure and hype associated with ls the marketing or better disinformation caign of polygon s well e and convinced many ethereum investors that they are a l when the concept s very new while this move is brillia it is also malicious un arbitrum or optimism polygon is in fact a side chain and therefore as much an l to ethereum as solana or other ls avax are evm compatible chains the latter also tried to position as a spoon a friendly fork they barely burn a few s a day in eth gas fees eth in hours vs eth by unisp al polygon pos claims that the side chain architecture is temporary and that it will transition io a roll up e g polygon zkevm polygon hermez but this remains highly questionable and poteially is another false flag roll ups currely accrue little value and once they become big enough they ly try to create their own ls there is no inceive for them to do this move there is no such thing as symbiotic relationship between ethereum and polygon as of today and in fact they soak up its economic bandwidth revenue it is nothing but a big trojan horse and should be investigated very suspiciously by the ethereum community going forrd ,polygon matic is not beneficial to ethereum and acts as a parasitic side chain soaking up its economic bandwidth ,1.0,1,yme67l,antana18,0,2022-11-04 23:43:06,1667605401,1669824855,2022-11-04,23:43:06

ethereum,which is currely approx eth a considerable market discou why is it a mismatch of liquidity providers i see that large amous of eth have been deposited to these dex while stablecoin tvl appears to have been dwindling or is it just a harbinger of the fact that large eth sellers are selling on smaller dexes and keeping the price artificially high on the large exchanges anyy its probably not going to be here for long right i picked up some cheap eth and will it to see what the market does rupert b,certain dexes have eth priced up to cheaper than coinbase a profitable strategy longterm or just a weekend glitch ,1.0,1,ymaiq4,helpless_bullion,0,2022-11-04 21:09:13,1667596168,1669824892,2022-11-04,21:09:13

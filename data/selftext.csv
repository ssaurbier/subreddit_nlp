bitcoin,the energy produced by mining will be turned into heat in the end so wouldn't it be possible to use high end bitcoin miners to create devices which are normally just meant to produce heat like an electric sto a washing machine or electric water boilers erytime you boil your water you'd ha a small chance of basically winning the lottery so your mining activity is basically for free besides of the more expensi devices in the end this would make mining less profitable for miners maybe mining will only be profitable if the energy is used to heat up something else maybe a water boiler is a bad exle since you probably only use it a few times per day but for something you use regularly maybe ha it running the whole day maybe some industrial devices in factories or at least in electric heaters when homes 't ha a traditional heater ,using electric water boilers to mine bitcoin,1.0,1,10ficwm,porky11,0,2023-01-18 20:51:42,1674075116,1674075117,2023-01-18,20:51:42

bitcoin,i'm new here so please 't downvote me to hell i ha seen a lot of people here using dca as an instment strategy on btc i understand that the idea is just buy btc at a regular interval whater the price is in theory this should en out price volatility or the years but btc volatility is legendary the huge price swings can be x or en x in a month for that reason i would argue that dca is the worst strategy for buying btc if something anything just xed in price i am definitely not buying it common sense tells me that the price will drop at some point if i bought btc before the x pump logically i immediately sell it and x my money also i 't need btc to get through life if i did need btc to survi i might consider buying it when prices double on the off chance that the price might double again and i'd be forced to buy at x i belie timing is important when buying and selling assets and goods a dozen eggs is at the grocery store right now i 't think that price will go to if i want to bake a cake i will wait until the price of eggs drops again used car prices went crazy last year i kept driving my crap car for another year until the prices dropped when gas prices doubled i stopped taking road trips real estate is orvalued and interest rates ha quadrupled so i'm selling my house to me this is all common sense if i had extra money and didn't care about prices i wouldn't think about any of this but isn't the purpose of insting to make money ,can we discuss dollar cost araging dca as an instment strat ,1.0,1,10ffxh3,tenthousandbottles,0,2023-01-18 19:15:45,1674069356,1674069357,2023-01-18,19:15:45

bitcoin,bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that allows for peer to peer transactions without the need for a middleman or intermediary this means that transactions can be made directly between individuals without the need for a bank or gornment to orsee or regulate them one of the main benefits of bitcoin is its ability to provide financial freedom and autonomy it allows individuals to ha control or their own money without the need for a centralized authority this can be particularly useful for people living in countries with unstable currencies or corrupt gornments another benefit of bitcoin is its security and immutability transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain which is highly secure and resistant to fraud or tering this means that transactions made with bitcoin are much less susceptible to hacking or theft compared to traditional forms of currency additionally bitcoin is a global currency that can be used anywhere in the world regardless of geographic location or political boundaries this makes it an ideal choice for people who tral frequently or need to send money across borders in summary bitcoin is a powerful tool that can provide financial freedom security and global accessibility it has the potential to reshape the way we think about money and the financial system as a whole it's worth keeping an eye on its delopment and use cases ,why i belie we need bitcoin,1.0,1,10ekra7,debaasmeister,0,2023-01-17 19:19:35,1673983194,1673983195,2023-01-17,19:19:35
bitcoin,i d like to discuss the various meanings of deflation and inflation i ha seen the usage of these words vary a lot in media and finance while i ha a decent understanding of what is going on i often get confused by the conflated use of these words and would like to clear some things up from my current knowledge i see inflation as being an increase in broad money supply for the fiat system this is best described as an increase in m for bitcoin it would be described as an increase in supply of bitcoins furthermore the rate of inflation is just the derivati of broad money supply basic calculus for bitcoin this is extremely easy to calculate based on the current halving cycle i e block subsidy and it sits around for fiat this is more complicated nebulous and volatile as of today the yoy increase in m is about due to recent rate hikes but it was obviously much higher in the past year financial institutions try to measure the inflation rate using cpi but this is blatantly biased and flawed since inflation effects eryone differently and the basket of goods is er changing on the other hand deflation is the decrease in broad money supply i won t go or the meaning agains since it is pretty much just the opposite of inflation hower i would like to better understand how bitcoin is deflationary as bitcoin entually reaches its hard cap of million it will become neither inflationary or deflationary i m not sure if there is a technical term for this but i ll call it sound in this state of sound money i understand that the prices of goods will deflate in relation to bitcoin as they already ha in the past while this makes sense to me i belie it is a misnomer to call bitcoin deflationary bitcoin would only be deflating if its supply was decreasing can someone please help me clear up these semantics ,definitions of inflation and deflation,1.0,1,10ej5xu,mindless-range-7764,0,2023-01-17 18:16:46,1673979426,1673979427,2023-01-17,18:16:46

bitcoin,one of the key features of bitcoin is that it has a finite supply of million coins this means that there will ner be more than million bitcoins in circulation according to the bitcoin protocol mining will continue until the year at that point the block reward for mining new blocks will be reduced to zero this is known as the halving of the block reward as a result there will be no more bitcoins created after this point once all million bitcoins ha been mined the only way for miners to earn rewards will be through transaction fees these fees will likely be much lower than the current block rewards and it is uncertain whether they will be enough to sustain the mining industry my question do you belie that this could lead to a slow death of the bitcoin network as fewer miners will be incentivized to maintain and secure the network ,the slow death of bitcoin,1.0,1,10eicbh,signinternational623,0,2023-01-17 17:44:55,1673977510,1673977510,2023-01-17,17:44:55

bitcoin,tl dr based on some thought experiments the price of btc could go crazy high t btc if it were being used as the global reser currency and used for eryday expenses hower a new global system run on btc would be more financially restricti and potentially much less extravagant due to deflationary impacts and significant reduction in credit loans but at the benefit of no boom bust cycles and no recessions it would be the financial discipline we all need but 't want finally you can't hoard all your btc if you want to see this future come to pass or it'll ner come thank the btc pizza guy for his first sacrifice we all imagine a wonderful future where bitcoin sers as the backbone of value the primary and absolute global currency hower i was thinking about some implications through various thought experiments and there may be some challenges for a bitcoin future we need to wrestle with i was also thinking of what the bitcoin price might be if it were used as the global reser currency thought experiment the bitcoin village imagine there's a village with only two people in it jack and jill jack owns bitcoin and jill owns none the total value of the village is bitcoin use that's all that's in existence in that village jill decides to build a house and agrees to sell it to jack for bitcoin now jill has btc and jack has btc the value of his house which is btc the total value of the village is now btc en though there are only btc in existence key takeaways jill created btc worth of value by building a house the economy can be worth way more btc than the actual number of btc thought experiment the village grows so now ten new people decide to mo to the village they ha no money so they need to work jill decides to hire them to build more houses so she needs to gi them some of her btc let's say jill gis them each btc to build one house each the village now has new houses hower the total supply of btc is still and jack doesn't want to spend his last on another house so he wants to pay less for another house jack agrees to buy all houses from jill at btc each the value of his original house just dropped from btc to btc a huge drop but on the other hand his btc somehow me a lot more valuable use he can now buy way more house for the same money jill is now rich as well having just sold a bunch of houses she continues to gi work to her new employees and they pay jack a little btc each month for rent as more and more people start pouring into the village the btc is starting to spread around and thousands of houses are created yet the value of each house necessarily needs to decline use there just isn't enough btc to go around in fact this happens to just about erything in the economy food energy entertainment etc prices keep declining and declining as thousands and millions of people flood into the village you can now buy entire houses for just a few satoshis key takeaways as btc is being more heavily used by more people the price of erything in btc has to drop in order to keep them affordable so anyone hoarding btc benefits big time since their btc can buy more and more each day so therefore extreme deflation in btc occurs as the adoption of btc rises and the economic activity of btc increases thought experiment the castle by now jill is super wealthy en though she only has btc she's the richest person in the village use that btc can buy tons of houses and just about anything she desires jack decides to build a gigantic castle and offers it to jill for btc she doesn't ha that much and that's more than the entire btc in existence in that village but she wants it really bad jack gis her the house but tells her that she has to pay him pack her debt to jack is now btc interest she faithfully pays jack btc ery month from money she gets from her rentals from the villagers the villagers keep getting their salary from working for jack and after a long time the debt is paid in full key takeaways the amount of debt in the village can far exceed the total amount of btc available that debt can en be repaid fully or time en though the debt is greater than the total number of btc orall realizations deflation traditionally economists 't like deflation use they say it will negatily impact economic activity use why would you spend money today if you know your money will be worth more tomorrow why did jack spend btc on a house when maybe he should ha waited until the houses would be cheaper later well i think this is ry true en for us today with btc why should we buy a cup of coffee with our btc when we know that btc might be worth thousands of dollars in the future think of the guy who bought the pizza for btc ouch so we're all wanting this btc economy but few of us are willing to jumpstart it use we want to hold on to our btc due to deflation but the biggest rise in the value will only really kick in if we actually start using our btc so it's necessary we can all thank the btc pizza guy and i think we should all do our parts and start using our btc except me i'll hoard debt exceeding the currency we talk about how it doesn't make sense for our current economy to ha more debt than currency in circulation but i think that's workable as shown in the thought experiment hower printing money to meet a deficit is definitely no no so the btc village sols that from happening so a btc economy that uses loans and where debts exceed the total amount of btc is totally fine since the value of the orall economy in btc can far far exceed the number of btc in circulation entually there won't be enough btc to pay for buying selling for exle if i wanted to buy a house from you and you needed the btc paid in full there may not be enough btc to pay you banks won't be able to print btc out of thin air to gi you and so that i can owe to the bank yes there may be people lending out their btc but access to credit will be significantly reduced compared to today perhaps that's a good thing more balanced approach to society we won't ha bull markets and bear markets and recessions but perhaps at the expense of what more disciplined lifestyles of less consumption i think that's the natural trajectory of this new economic structure max price of btc could become extremely high well unlike dollars btc is a ry hoardable asset due to the deflation mentioned abo imagine if millions and millions of people decided they wanted to hoard btc or more so that really the only btc in circulation to pay for things were just btc the price of btc would explode out of control of course things would equalize a bit use all the hoarders may want to go out and buy things with their new wealth but there will always be significant pressure to hoard in btc instead of today's norm which is to hoard wealth in stuff other than cash hoard value in houses hoard in stocks etc and this pressure will ha a major impact on the value of btc if only btc were remaining for transactions and the rest were hoarded then the value of btc would be equal to the current value of all currencies which is about t there's about t of currency in circulation globally or if we say only the currency of usd it would be worth about t per btc there's about t in usd in circulation if nobody hoarded btc and all million btc were used as cash is used today then each btc would be worth about k based on the t usd in circulation ,bitcoin as

bitcoin,since its inception there ha been discussions on bitcoins fate under a financial crisis while we ha not experienced it yet most people i ha heard agree that people most likely would pull out in larger numbers in need of liquidity with the recent upturn it made me wonder what would happen with a bull run at the start og middle of a crisis we ha seen before what power whales ha or the price and i suddenly a good opportunity the whales might start a bull run to get people off of the inflationary dollar and onto bitcoin this would atleast create a push that people who are seeing their money disappear use of inflation would not want to miss out on ,whales are orchestrating a bitcoin bull run set up for the next financial crisis ,1.0,1,10e5mu6,agentroi,0,2023-01-17 07:00:36,1673938852,1673938853,2023-01-17,07:00:36

bitcoin,one of the arguments for bitcoin is that its supply is not controlled by any entity so the gornment cannot just pump more money and cause inflation like we ha seen in the last couple of years but my question is if there can be a vibrant financial sector lending bitcoin doesn't that also alter the supply of bitcoin in a way that can actually ha a similar effect as the fed pumping fiat like i understand that there can be no new bitcoin created by lending it but if people use centralized exchanges en though they shouldn't i feel like we would run it a similar problem i e boom and bust cycles no ,hard money question,1.0,1,10e3r03,prepies04,0,2023-01-17 05:16:19,1673932589,1673932589,2023-01-17,05:16:19

bitcoin,from brett harrison's latest tweet an hour ago spilling the beans many ha asked questions about my time at ftx us and why i left when i did as i indicated earlier this week i m happy to begin sharing my experiences and perspecti publicly i worked at ftx us for senteen months when my resignation was made public those unfamiliar with my plans were surprised and some questioned whether i d been fired it seemed as though i d left a dream job abruptly after a ry short tenure the truth was that ftx us hadn t felt to me like the dream job it appeared to the industry and media for some time and my departure was not abrupt my relationship with sam bankman fried and his deputies had reached a point of total deterioration after months of disputes or management practices at ftx and as a group of my friends mentors and instors knew then i d felt such a strong conviction to found my own company that it wasn t worth keeping a dream job no matter the prestige or upside no matter the risk it posed to my reputation in departing so early sam asked me to join ftx us casually or in late march he was my former colleague at jane street and i had fond memories of his presence there we d barely stayed in touch or the years but i d occasionally read news about ftx s growth i was happy to hear from him and interested to learn more about how things were going at ftx i d known sam to be a conscientious junior trader at jane street who d e well in the programming for traders course i taught there in which he d been my student in manager meetings about sam s performance the senior traders on his desk indicated he had promise beyond that he seemed like a sensiti and intellectually curious person who cared about animals and that endeared him to me my negotiations to join ftx us mod quickly a welcome contrast to the months they d taken for ery mo i d made in traditional finance i d built software for jane street s crypto desk in but hadn t worked on crypto since i was excited to di back in my first few months at ftx us were wonderful i worked largely independently of sam to grow a us based team and foster a professional environment prepared for regulated businesses i made plans with the ledgerx team built out legal compliance and operations departments with first in class lateral hires and began setting up and building a us regulated retail stock brokerage ftx us s spot exchange was growing in market share the team was dedicated and producti customer feedback was positi i was excited about the future but from the start i noticed that while sam was rarely engaged on the us business decisions impacting the us would come without warning from the bahamas six months into my time at the company pronounced cracks began to form in my own relationship with sam around then i began advocating strongly for establishing separation and independence for the executi legal and deloper teams of ftx us and sam disagreed i saw in that early conflict his total insecurity and intransigence when his decisions were questioned his spitefulness and the volatility of his temperament i realized he wasn t who i remembered i wasn t sure what accounted for the dramatic change i saw in sam like many of us i ha family and friends who li with addiction and mental health problems and i seen how these problems often manifest without much warning in early adulthood i thought that might be a contributing factor and initially felt sympathetic but i didn t know sam well enough personally or ha any real time to reflect on the question i was in a business relationship with him and he was making a number of decisions about running a business that i disagreed with there was tremendous pressure not to disagree with sam but i did so anyway at that time and for all of my time at ftx us his influence or the media ftx s partners the nture capital industry and the traditional finance industry was pervasi and unyielding standing up to an insecure prideful manager is hard under any circumstance but it s nearly impossible when ery day ery major voice of culture and commerce deafens you with a narrati that implies if you disagree with your manager you clearly must be wrong i wasn t the only one at ftx us who disagreed with sam and members of his inner circle ftx us was staffed with experienced professionals from us finance firms law firms and regulated exchanges our collecti experience and professional acumen were frequently treated as though they were irrelevant and valueless it was extremely frustrating for all of us or the ensuing months i further argued for enacting a sensible hiring policy for staffing ftx us with a c suite of experienced officers for transparent communication between sam and ftx us leadership for gary wang s and nishad singh s software delopment responsibilities to be formally identified and shared across a larger group for the delegation of managerial responsibility and controls beyond sam and bahamas based executis and other important matters sam was uncomfortable with conflict he responded at times with dysregulated hostility at times with gaslighting and manipulation but ultimately chose to isolate me from communication on key decision making it felt terrible i sought out information about decisions that had been made behind my back desperate but trying hard not to show it in early april my elenth month i made one last try i made a written formal complaint about what i saw to be the largest organizational problems inhibiting ftx s future success i wrote that i would resign if the problems weren t addressed in response i was threatened on sam s behalf that i would be fired and that sam would destroy my professional reputation i was instructed to formally retract what i d written and to delir an apology to sam that had been drafted for me that ent solidified my decision to lea i knew an abrupt departure would be harmful to the company and my ftx us reports and i wanted to best position the company for future success after i left so i gradually wound down finished building and releasing the us stock brokerage and saw ftx us employees through their mid year reviews and with that i shifted my focus to the future and to my own company the information that is now in the public record from indictments complaints guilty pleas or otherwise show facts that en now after months are difficult for me to assimilate into reality i raised concerns at the company believing that the management and organizational issues i saw were typical of growing start ups and that my role as an experienced financial services executi was to correct them and unlock the next stage of the company s growth i ner could ha guessed that underlying these kinds of issues which i d seen at other more mature firms in my career and belied not to be fatal to business success was multi billion dollar fraud it s clear from what has been made public that the scheme was held closely by sam and his inner circle at ftx com and alameda which i was not a part of nor were other executis at ftx us i understand now why they carefully concealed their criminal activity from us we ha extensi professional networks our own lines of communication with us regulators and our own authority to speak to us media if any one of us had suspected let alone learned the truth we would ha reported them immediately or my senteen months at ftx us my colleagues and i dedicated erything to serving the needs of our customers and growing real businesses we belied offered consumers a way to more equitably access financial services that are central to their lis ancient forms of greed and dishonesty destroy trust and corrupt progress the scale of this particular instance of this lesson is difficult to comprehend but far from exceptional in the twel years of my professional experience in finance it s a strange dissonance after i left ftx us and up until nomber nearly ery conrsation i had with a nture capitalist about my new company entually came around to the same kind of question is ftx insting is sam okay with you doing this do you mind if we confirm with him after that many conrsations entually came around to the same kind of apology we know you weren t invold in what sam and others did but we can t take on the pr risk of associating oursels with ftx no matter how capable you are or compelling your idea is the last few months ha provided me with a valuable character study of the industry some treated me like an entirely different person ornight some immediately offered sympathy and support it will be a difficult experience to forget it will also be difficult to forget the frenzied and baseless accusations leled against me on social media for exle that my resignation could only mean i had knowledge of a criminal scheme en though there s no evidence of that and available information shows the scheme was run by a small number of people in another country and began years before i joined ftx us or that i m seeking a plea deal en though i han t been accused of wrongdoing and am not a target in any instigation or that while at ftx us i colluded with citadel to manipulate tokenized stock prices yes people are actually saying this i m grateful from the bottom of my heart to those who showed me unwaring trust and support through the turbulence of the last two months they helped me cut through the noise and remain focused on the future en as they themsels had been harmed by the tragedy of ftx s collapse i credit them along with my family with getting me through the most devastating and destabilizing ent of my professional life i m extremely honored to ha them as partners the path ahead of me is clear now and i m excited to mo forward together with them source ,why ftx us president left tweet thread unrolled

bitcoin,so are we pumping use janet yellen has declared we will hit the debt cieling in a week and the republicans in congress seem dysfuctional enough to hit that or are we pumping use the cpi numbers show lower inflation keep in mind that these are two diametrically opposed reasons to pump if the us defaults the treasuries will be downgraded and as a result the interest rates on bonds and erything else will go through the roof doesnt matter what the fed thinks the interest should be its going to go to or more terrible situation if the cpi numbers are good the fed can say inflation is dropping and lower the interest rates which makes for a good situation for risk on assets so which is it is it a pump out of fear of default and us dollar going to zero or a pump out of greed and speculation that the fed will lower interest rates ,so thoughts on why we are pumping ,1.0,1,10bgrd3,gitk-ghost,0,2023-01-14 05:42:58,1673674988,1673674989,2023-01-14,05:42:58

bitcoin,i ha heard this a lot about btc btc is a zero sum game which to me implies money can't be made by owning btc my intention in writing this is not to discuss peoples motis for why they own btc and whether they are right or wrong this zero sum nonsense keeps ringing in my ear is btc really a zero sum game well yes in my opinion if we are discussing transactions in terms of btc its actually a slight net loss ery transaction requires some sort of network fee but on the other had in terms of dollars it really depends if you assume the interest in btc remains constant from this moment of time on then holding btc inherently increases in dollar value ortime if you assume no increase or decrease in btc then you're comparing a finite number with fiat which the fed for exle prints more and more of ortime by this train of thought your x amount of btc last year will be worth some amount more in fiat this year so in terms of dollars its likely a net gain i 't claim to be a financial wizard in fact i'm fine if this is completely idiotic but the argument of measuring something that that doesn't increase with something that does increase points to btc being a net gain a store of value if nothing else meaning btc gains no further adoption i 't see how it doesn't ser the purpose of holding money printer accountable ok ok but there could be more crypto currencies i get this argument too technically the number of crypto currencies could approach infinity making btc a net loss if interest was distributed amongst those other currencies that's fine but i also 't see that as a threat i think there is inherent dominance in being the original i can't really articulate that thought much further thoughts this is caman math i get it just wondering what else would be interesting to consider ,btc is a zero sum game,1.0,1,10a8t5i,astroportal_,0,2023-01-12 19:50:53,1673553065,1673553066,2023-01-12,19:50:53

bitcoin,indicators are a key component of technical analysis used to help traders and instors identify trends patterns and opportunities in the market but with so many indicators to choose from it can be orwhelming to know where to start one of the most basic and widely used indicators is the moving arage a moving arage takes the arage closing price of a security or a set number of periods and plots it as a line on a chart this helps to smooth out short term fluctuations and real longer term trends another popular indicator is the relati strength index rsi which compares the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses to determine orbought or orsold conditions the rsi is typically plotted on a scale of with lels abo indicating orbought conditions and lels below indicating orsold conditions but beyond the basics there are countless other indicators available each with their own unique capabilities and strengths some indicators such as the bollinger bands use standard deviation to measure volatility while others such as the fibonacci retracement use geometric ratios to identify potential lels of support and resistance it's important to remember that indicators are just one tool in a trader's arsenal they should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis such as price action and fundamental analysis to gi a more complete picture of the market and while indicators can be helpful they are not always accurate and can produce false signals with that being said we belie that our ema locity indicator is a powerful tool to help you make better trading decisions you can check it out on our website by clicking the link your website link we wish you the best of luck in your trading journey ,indicators understanding the basics of technical analysis,1.0,1,108fw0v,stocked-fish,0,2023-01-10 17:44:34,1673372691,1673372692,2023-01-10,17:44:34

bitcoin, from concept to reality the birth and growth of bitcoin the days of being tied to traditional forms of a currency controlled by gornments are gone bitcoin a decentralized digital currency allows you to send funds from anywhere in the world to anywhere else instantly securely and with minimal fees if any at all but the story of bitcoin goes back much further than its practical uses it all started in with satoshi nakamoto who introduced the world to a decentralized network capable of achieving consensus without any central authority this concept known as the byzantine generals' problem in the world of computer science and distributed systems had stumped experts since it was first described in that is until nakamoto claimed to ha found a solution initially met with laughter and dismissal nakamoto went on to publish software that allowed the creation of the bitcoin network just three months after releasing his groundbreaking paper aka bitcoin a peer to peer electronic cash contrary to popular belief bitcoin is not a company or organization but rather a standard or protocol similar to tcp ip or the internet it operates based on a set of mathematical rules agreed upon by all participants in the network thanks to this system and the inntion of nakamoto bitcoin allows for a completely decentralized network of computers to reach a consensus on transactions happening on the network effectily determining who holds the money in this peer to peer network sending money from one account to another is as easy as sending an email there's no intermediary ery minutes the entire network reaches a consensus on what transactions ha occurred through a simple electronic election all without the need for a central authority but the real significance of bitcoin lies in its potential for a decentralized organization on a scale ner before seen yes it can be used as a currency but it also has the ability to revolutionize voting stock ownership asset registration and en notarization 't get caught up in the fluctuating price of bitcoin the currency instead understand the revolutionary technology and network it has created since the inception of bitcoin the following consensus rules ha remained unchanged a maximum of million bitcoins will er be produced a target of minute block intervals halving ents occurring ery blocks roughly ery years a block reward starting at and halving continually at each halving ent until it reaches estimated to occur around any change to these parameters requires the consensus of all bitcoin participants so not only does bitcoin provide a decentralized network for financial transactions but it also has a decentralized system for decision making and rule setting hey there if there's something you're interested in let me know i'm always happy to write about different topics also i'm trying to post more on twitter so if you're into that gi me follow me on twitter my handle is jpeg tycoon i usually post times a week ha a great day , ch from concept to reality the birth and growth of bitcoin ,1.0,1,10876zx,cyber_oligarch,0,2023-01-10 11:06:26,1673348799,1673348799,2023-01-10,11:06:26

bitcoin,hey all i' been going down the rabbit hole these past months there's a thought i'm trying to work through and i was wondering if someone could sharpen my thinking on this i would appreciate it if you could either correct any missing information or lapse in logic so i was listening to a debate between greg foss peter mccormack and peter schiff one of schiff's arguments was money can only work if its commodity money he ga the exle that if the gold price for whater reason starts plummeting it cannot go to zero reason being it will be bought up by industries for their use value namely electronics dental fillings and jewelry or sculpture art schiff claims bitcoin can go to zero use there is not use value in the physical world no one needs it for computer parts no one can eat it etc i find this argument to be incorrect i can't find the exact year but it seems like gold was first utilized as components in electronic devices in the early s that leas thousands of years where gold's only use value was in dentistry and jeweler i think we can dismiss jewelry as a use case for gold why use jewelry is about signaling power and wealth why not wear a necklace made with fool's gold they could make it just as pretty with a nice yellow shine if there was another another magical metal in history that had all the properties of gold plus it was only accessible by a word phrase that only the bearer knows and can teleport it to the other side of the world would there be a demand for jewelry made from this magic metal meanwhile would the demand for gold jewelry go down considerably i think so it's accurate to say gold's properties as a money makes people want to make jewelry out of it not that people desire to make jewelry out of gold use its a beautiful shiny malleable metal gold jewelry is kind of a side effect or application of gold's value it doesn't seem like a use case to me use once gold's monetary value is gone most of the demand for gold jewelry will disappear in regards to dentistry there's a bunch of other metals that can be used including silr so the conclusion i'm coming to with this reasoning is other than dentistry gold was largely a useless rock up until it was used for electronics it functioned as a money for thousands of years use of it's chemical properties lend well to use as a money if gold has function with almost no use case in the real world for thousands of years why can't bitcoin doesn't this mean schiff's argument is kind of weak here one thing to add doesn't bitcoin ha use cases in cyberspace there's facebook code that siphons data which is more valuable than a real world commodity like oil ,did gold really ha use value before electronics ,1.0,1,107y52h,mike_woo_sculptor,0,2023-01-10 02:37:35,1673318267,1673318268,2023-01-10,02:37:35

bitcoin,as a crypto holder you are betting on the demand of the coin rising but there is no calculable value as a owner of a stock you ha a legal right to the cash flows which then gis those calculable value if you belie a company will ner grow and pay a dividend of forer and you want to earn it is intrinsically worth now things can go wrong with that forecast or impro and get a higher or lower return but the return estimate is based in rifiable mathback to crypto if you want to be inflammatory call it greater fool theory if you want to be fair you are betting on someone buying it from a higher price but there is no intrinsic reason as to why someone would pay more you t get a pro rated share of the earnings of crypto there are none or a percentage of users or an adoption dividend or anything you just own a coin no different than a sports card the best exle i can think that is similar to crypto but shows the difference in value with a stock is visa visa processes trillion in payments annually if you own the company the get a small percentage of that as they process more transactions all else equal it will be worth more with bitcoin or any coin if bitcoin increases it s volume you ha no reason for the coin to gain value use you t get anything logically by transactions going up your back to hoping someone will pay more than you did this is the main difference between stocks and crypto values historically assets that t produce cash flows like gold or homes not rented grow at the same as fiat printing inflation lumber was basically flat or the past years excluding covid copper was nearly or the past years why should crypto be any different than other non cash flowing assets ,a legit discussion on valuation of crypto vs stocks vs non cash flowing assets,1.0,1,106tjk9,rifleman209,0,2023-01-08 20:36:38,1673210214,1673210214,2023-01-08,20:36:38

bitcoin,there is a lot of fear around setting up a multi sig wallet whether it's the setup itself or the fear of restoring the wallet from scratch it can be intimidating to mo from single sig into the wonderful world of multi sig but it's worth it as your stack grows to be a more and more substantial part of your wealth so will the fear of losing your stack via a single point of failure with single sig i know that there are ways to create redundancy and security with single sig e g sd card wallet backups multiple seedphrase locations passphrases but i would argue that if you are willing to create redundancy and extra security with single sig you already ha the motivation and likely the technical expertise to mo to multi sig so enter multi ndor multi sig sparrow first why multi sig in general there are two major compelling reasons for multi sig redundancy from single key loss or theft this one is obvious plausible deniability in a wrench attack this second one was the main one that made me mo to multi sig in the er increasing world of data leaks and kyc it has become almost impossible to stay incognito as a bitcoiner having multi sig makes the effort to physically coerce you so much more difficult if an attacker has to transport you to another location especially if it's a public place like a bank security deposit box and as multi sig becomes the norm then physically coerci attacks become less tempting as a whole in the space second sparrow wallet makes multi sig setup a breeze to start it's open source the ui is so much more user friendly than electrum and it automatically prompts super important steps like downloading the backup script to restore the wallet it has been formatted to work seamlessly with almost all the major hardware wallets finally why multi ndor multi sig why not just coldcards in a of setup or trezors in a of setup by creating a setup where no ndor has a quorum of keys e g coldcards bitboxes trezor you remo that tiny little worry that one of the companies could be malicious and has somehow gotten your keys either via a usb connection or incomplete entropy at key generation or that you' been the target of a supply chain attack technically you should en be able to trust closed source hardware wallets e g ledger in a setup like this still recommending open source though as a matter of principle in the bitcoin space hower if you go down this route these are the absolute imperatis to setting up a multi sig wallet you must backup your wallet and store a copy of all the xpubs preferably in both electronic and physical form if you need to restore your wallet from scratch you will need the xpubs of all the keys not just a quorum this is by far the biggest pitfall of multi sig luckily sparrow prompts you to create this backup at the time of wallet creation at least preferably all of your hardware wallets needs to be able to rify the multi sig wallet including the xpubs of all signers on the device i won't go into too much detail but malware could insert additional cosigners at the time of wallet creation so you need an external validation of the wallet setup hardware wallets that i know can do this from personal experience are bitbox coldcard and foundation passport i'm sure there are others but i can't speak to those this applies to both single and multi sig but you should always rify send and recei addresses on the hardware device itself i will plug for foundation passport on this one they make recei address rification via qr code ry streamlined there's a lot more to the actual use of multisig including using psbts with certain hardware wallets but these actually 't differ from single sig other than having to do it multiple times rather than just once per transaction i could go on and on about other aspects of vs of storage location of keys seedless setups but this post is getting long if you are interested in seeing sparrow in action with multi sig here's a great video that finally prompted me to go with sparrow s multisig starts at ,multi ndor multi sig sparrow wallet one of if not the best self soreign solutions to self custody,1.0,1,106kulg,realistic-jelly8133,0,2023-01-08 14:43:25,1673189022,1673189022,2023-01-08,14:43:25

bitcoin,here are some pros and cons of bitcoin pros decentralized bitcoin is decentralized meaning that it is not controlled by any gornment or financial institution this gis users more control or their own money and makes it harder for external parties to censor or seize their funds limited supply there is a limited supply of bitcoin with a maximum of million coins that will er be created this can make it a good store of value as the limited supply could potentially lead to an increase in the value of the remaining coins secure bitcoin uses a technology called blockchain which is a decentralized and secure ledger of all transactions this makes it difficult for hackers to steal bitcoin or manipulate the blockchain cons volatility the price of bitcoin is known to be volatile with large swings in value occurring or short periods of time this can make it risky to hold as an instment as it is difficult to predict how the price will change in the future limited acceptance while bitcoin is accepted by a growing number of merchants and individuals it is still not widely accepted as a form of payment this can make it difficult to use in day to day transactions complexity bitcoin and blockchain technology can be complex and may be difficult for some people to understand this can make it less accessible to the general public and may limit its adoption regulatory uncertainty the regulatory status of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is still uncertain in many countries this can create uncertainty for instors and users and may discourage some people from using or insting in bitcoin ,i asked gpt pros and cons of bitcoin did it miss anything ,1.0,1,106dv7x,therobotdr,0,2023-01-08 08:16:17,1673165788,1673165789,2023-01-08,08:16:17

bitcoin,today we're officially launching a website called seedle io that enables people to enhance the security of their wallets by scrambling the order of their seed phrases based on a secret key the way it works is that a secret key generates a unique combination of scrambled numbers that map to the actual order of a seed for exle the key hello world generates this combination gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt the sequence on the left side represents the false order and the combination on the right side represents the true order what we get is that instead of actually being the first phrase in the seed the combination reals that the first phrase is at is at and so on note that the bolded in the th position is meant to be replaced with an incorrect phrase from the list of words this scrambled order creates a layer of cryptographic security that obscures the true identity of a seed the difficulty of guessing the correct order is or x to put that into perspecti a computer guessing or combinations per second would take years to exhaust all possible combinations the best part of this security enhancement is that you do not need to enter your seed phrase anywhere all that's required is a password that only you know the rest of the process is using the combination as your seed and hiding it as usual or not here's mine column column measure earth kind satoshi mouse write violin human woman atom dinosaur devote alien royal cabin tornado bra engine month achie law buddy gold cool check out our producthunt s caign for more details and to share feedback the service will be completely free to use so please sign up for updates en if you cannot help fund the project tldr hash a secret passphrase to generate a unique scrambled combination that maps to the actual order of a seed ,an extra layer of security for recory seeds,1.0,1,103thjx,seedle_io,0,2023-01-05 08:07:34,1672906065,1672906066,2023-01-05,08:07:34

bitcoin,hey all i recently set up my own lnd lightning network daemon node and ha been learning about the best practices for managing and optimizing it one thing i' been struggling with is rebalancing my channels to ensure that they are enly balanced and not costing me more in fees than they are worth after some research i discored a really easy way to rebalance my lnd node using a tool called lnrebalance it's an open source command line tool that can automatically rebalance my node based on configurable criteria such as the minimum and maximum channel balance and the maximum fee percentage to use lnrebalance all i had to do was install it using the go get command and then run it from the terminal with the desired options it handled the rest of the rebalancing process automatically saving me a lot of time and effort if you're running your own lnd node and are looking for an easy way to rebalance your channels i highly recommend giving lnrebalance a try it's been a game changer for me and i hope it can help you too what tools or techniques do you guys use to rebalance your lnd nodes let me know in the comments ,effortlessly rebalance your lnd node with lnrebalance,1.0,1,1033jge,debaasmeister,0,2023-01-04 13:20:02,1672838416,1672838416,2023-01-04,13:20:02

bitcoin,id like to offer a few charts i' been working on for an open discussion all opinions thoughs and suggestions are welcome a few notes to begin orange rtical line is a halving date green line is top forecast for next cycle the date chosen is the arage time to top from the previous halvings line of best fit is exponential looks linear on a log base graph chart y axis is log scale base first chart halvings top estimate k second chart halvings top estimate k third chart previous low to current low top estimate k discussion it's interesting to see the lower the timeframe that the chart looks back the lower the forecast high of the next cycle is i belie the reason is due to the diminishing blow off tops we are seeing from cycle to cycle i ha a theory for that bitcoin network access to new funds the first cycle bitcoin gained access to a new pool of funds first mors the second cycle bitcoin also gained access to a new pool of funds through a rise in exchanges providing easy access the third cycle bitcoin gained access to new funds through a large increase in media corage the fourth cycle current cycle bitcoin didn't gain access funds that would make as significant a step change to the price as it had in previous cycles as such the lack of blow off top in the current cycle effects the best fit price forecast more significantly when the time period examined is lower so where should the top estimate fall with such a wide range showing in the charts between k and k with no significant increase in access to new funds i'm looking at k as a top if seral larger nations start to adpot btc as legal tender i'm looking at k as a top if seral larger nations and institutions gain access through clear and favorable regulation then i'm looking at k as a top i belie on a log scale these ents ha a similar impact to the previously discussed ents in past cycles such as first mors rise in exchanges and increase in media conrage we are currently at k suggesting from the current value we see a increase to the top of the next cycle the better question i think is what should an exit strategy look like well we currently ha days until the next halving and days until the estimated top based on previous cycles cycle was days from halving to top cycle was days from halving to top with years to top an exit strategy is a tough question to consider especially considering the swings in monetary policy or the last years for now i'm looking purely at the time to top and its correlation with the halving the halving ent inherrently forms a supply demand crunch causing upward pressure on the price significant upward prices always lead to fomo and hence an orshoot on true val as we ha seen in ery cycle the time duration of this orshoot has always been roughly the same in the btc space again days in the past cycles if there is one thing i am willing to rely on it is that human nature repeats itself this date for those curious is th of october what would ha me re evaluate the estimated top date is if one of the aformentioned ents large nations adopting btc and institutional access occurs months after the halving in which case i think we could see the top date pushed further out due to a late boom in access to new funds in this case i would start to look at the k to form the basis of my exit strategy rather than a set date let us know your thoughts as a final though provoker we often see an estimate cap put on btc due to its similarity to gold as a store of value digital gold the valuation of the gold market is roughly t hower is estimated to be ish physical to paper ratio why do we not see this considered when corrilating it in a store of value sense to btc not financial advice ,btc price forecast discussion,1.0,1,102nhng,digital_oceans,0,2023-01-03 23:42:33,1672789365,1672789365,2023-01-03,23:42:33

bitcoin,if you consider the following from the manifesto gt the distinguishing feature of communism is not the abolition of property generally but the abolition of bourgeois property but modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products that is based on class antagonisms on the exploitation of the many by the few in this sense the theory of the communists may be summed up in the single sentence abolition of private property gt we communists ha been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man s own labour which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom activity and independence hard won self acquired self earned property do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form there is no need to abolish that the delopment of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it and is still destroying it daily fascinating that the discory of bitcoin has single handedly destroyed the entire theory of the communism as for the first time in human history private property can be granted to anyone in the world as a true bearer asset and those rights will be upheld by the network regardless of your class background real world influence the hard work one puts into accumulating wealth to provide for and protect his family can be exchanged for a private property which is honest sound ethical grounded in physics and mathematics most people on this planet cannot access banking and that is the biggest divider of wealthy inequality use money is half of erything we do the simplicity of code has remod the marginalisation of the majority of people on this planet by establishing the same property rights for a multi billionaire in america and a poor farmer in nigeria while secured via true free market capitalism with the mining industry poor communities in rural areas are now able to tap into locked up natural resources that would otherwise gone to waste by expelling into the atmosphere and monetise the energy by mining bitcoin by implementing a system that respects true integrity soundness and honesty satoshi nakamoto has quite literally destroyed the main tenant of the communist ideology by providing property rights to billion people without exploiting a single being ,reading the communist manifesto through bitcoin lens is fascinating,1.0,1,100x9nv,itsnotthatdeepbrah,0,2023-01-01 23:47:07,1672616847,1672616847,2023-01-01,23:47:07

bitcoin,in which i was speculating on btc s usd price to exceed k in and entually become the global reser currency within years let get into it human beings ha a hard time understanding exponential growth for a number of reasons one of the main reasons is that our brains are wired to think in linear terms we are used to things growing or changing at a steady rate and exponential growth does not follow this pattern exponential growth is characterized by a rapid increase in which the rate of increase itself increases this means that the growth becomes faster and faster or time a common exle of exponential growth is the concept of compound interest if you inst a certain amount of money at a certain rate of interest the amount of money you earn will increase or time hower the rate of increase will also increase so the longer you lea the money insted the more it will grow this can be hard for people to wrap their heads around use it goes against our natural instincts we are used to thinking about things in terms of how much they increase by a certain amount or a certain period of time exponential growth on the other hand increases by a certain percentage or a certain period of time which means that the rate of increase itself increases another reason why humans ha a hard time understanding exponential growth is that it is difficult to visualize when we think about growth we tend to think about it in terms of physical objects or quantities that we can see and touch hower exponential growth is not something that we can easily obser in the physical world it is a mathematical concept that is difficult to visualize which makes it harder for us to understand a further reason why exponential growth can be hard to understand is that it is often counterintuiti for exle if you start with a small number and double it repeatedly the resulting numbers may not seem ry significant at first hower if you keep doubling the number it will entually become much larger than you might ha expected this is use each time you double the number you are adding a much larger amount than you did the time before finally humans ha a hard time understanding exponential growth use it can lead to seemingly impossible or unbelievable outcomes for exle if a virus were to double in size ery day it would seem impossible that it could take or the world in just a few short weeks hower this is exactly what can happen with exponential growth it may start off small but it can quickly become much larger than anyone could ha predicted if you are still with me and are having a hard time connecting the concept of exponential growth to bitcoin let me explain bitcoin a decentralized digital currency has seen exponential growth since its creation in one of the main reasons for this is that bitcoin has a limited supply there will only er be million bitcoins in existence and as more and more people become aware of and interested in bitcoin the demand for it increases this limited supply combined with increasing demand has led to the price of bitcoin experiencing exponential growth or time hower this exponential growth has also made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin use of its non linear growth it is difficult to use traditional financial models to forecast the price of bitcoin this has led to a great deal of speculation and uncertainty surrounding the future of the currency another factor contributing to the difficulty in understanding the exponential growth of bitcoin is the fact that it is a relatily new and highly complex technology the use of blockchain a decentralized ledger that records all bitcoin transactions adds an additional layer of complexity to the currency this complexity can make it difficult for people to fully understand how bitcoin works and how it is valued the exponential growth of bitcoin has been drin by a combination of limited supply increasing demand and the complexity of the technology behind it this growth has made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin but has also attracted a great deal of interest due to the potential for significant returns on instment in conclusion humans ha a hard time understanding exponential growth use it goes against our natural linear thinking is difficult to visualize is often counterintuiti and can lead to seemingly impossible outcomes it is important for people to understand this concept hower use it can ha significant implications in many different areas including economics population growth and the spread of diseases tldr exponential growth is difficult for people to conceptualize use it goes against our natural linear thinking is often counterintuiti and can lead to seemingly impossible outcomes btc has already experienced exponential growth multiple times and is still in its infancy dca and hodl ,exponential growth understanding and the lack there of as it relates to btc

bitcoin, geographic location is a crucial factor in the profitability of bitcoin mining operations the cost of electricity which is one of the main expenses for miners can vary greatly depending on where a mining operation is located in some areas electricity may be generated primarily from renewable sources which can be cheaper than electricity generated from fossil fuels under certain circumstances the cost of cooling equipment may be lower in some locations due to natural factors such as lower ambient temperatures or greater supply of more efficient cooling technology some countries or regions may ha regulations that make it difficult or expensi to set up a mining operation while others may be more welcoming to the industry by carefully considering the abo factors and choosing a location that is favorable for mining operators can maximize their chances of success in a sector as competiti as bitcoin mining ,how important is the geographic location for btc mining at this time ,1.0,1,zzg7tk,connect_lifeguard_67,0,2022-12-31 00:23:06,1672446200,1672446201,2022-12-31,00:23:06

bitcoin,i should preface this post by letting folks know that i am not a coder that said hower my concerns are that when newer rsions of bitcoin core comes out you see bug fixes etc from the previous rsion but also there are occasionally changes to the rules of consensus this essentially means that if you upgrade to the latest rsion you effectily vote for that new rules of consensus from your rsion of what previously you voted bitcoin was imo there should be a differenent approach here when bugs are found why not update the older rsions as well without touching the rules of consensus in said older rsions you could still ha the original rsions available for reference hower this approach would keep the bitcoin network safer and more robust while continuing to allow the individual node operators to decide what rsion of bitcoin is the true bitcoin which is the whole point aka decentralization for exle i'm not a fan of taro or taproot in general for that matter in the bitcoin protocol so i 't run bitcoin core beyond a certain rsion unfortunately these rsions ha apparently since had bugs reported and remedied by later rsions that said my concern there is that entually my rsions may ha fatal bugs uncored and the only way to keep bitcoin running is to upgrade to something that i would consider to be true bitcoin any thoughts on this would be appreciated in the mean time i'll continue to dca and take immediate possession of my private keys to ppkh addresses only which i generate offline as to forward this peaceful moment ,the bitcoin node rules of consensus make bitcoin well bitcoin hower ,1.0,1,zxuezy,bitcoincansaveusall,0,2022-12-29 03:30:46,1672284665,1672284665,2022-12-29,03:30:46

bitcoin,so i noticed a strong trend deloping of people asking quite legitimate questions of btcs future and that of wider crypto only to be met back with half baked platitudes that those of us in the community ha heard many times before despite this there are some serious questions that the btc community need to consider i detailed below a series of real life not technical issues that face btc if anyone can respond to them with genuine logical responses then please do so if you feel compelled to reply with something like this is fud or your comment is a buy signal then just pop your self back in the poorly informed box from which you came this time is different btc has ner witnessed a macro economic environment like this before this is a fact btc performed as a risk on asset only and is strongly correlated with the likes of the nsdq in an environment that may see major indexes like the s p dow nsdq fail to return ath across a yr period what would this mean for btc the institutions are not coming btc took yrs to attract a comparatily slight lel of institutional interest following significant issues around esg compliance repeated frauds and scams ala tera and ftx etc as well as a lack of regulation it is likely that institutions will struggle to regain any foothold within the space er again we ha seen this all before mt gox etc no we han t ner before has so much been lost by so many in an environment that was already being lined up as a target by regulators the core argument here being that the actions of a few crypto bros ha likely damaged the space so irrevocably that the coming regulation is likely to be puniti in the extreme for retail it is highly likely that regulators will seek to control all on and off rs making it near impossible to own or realise any gains for institutions it is likely that the regulation will be designed to limit prent adoption there will be no etf er energy usage is an issue regardless of the facts of environmental impact the energy price is not stabilising and is highly unlikely to do so under the current geopolitical conditions this is now leading to a declining hash rate this combined with little price action will lead to stagnation what s the narrati as much as the maxis belie in the btc gospel of freedoms and pharmaceutical grade money the nly thing that has brought new people to the space is price speculation with the abo being true and the potential for little positi price action across a significant timeframe what is the narrati that would bring new people to this space ,time for an grown up conrsation,1.0,1,zwv64s,plus-ad1544,0,2022-12-28 00:29:08,1672187359,1672187359,2022-12-28,00:29:08

bitcoin,bitcoin maxis lo the idea of bitcoin becoming a widely used as a deflationary currency and it is often compared to gold as a store of value let s look at the history of the gold standard as a comparison specifically the departure from the gold standard leading up to and after wwii the gold standard was swapped for the bretton woods system until it was erased by nixon in the early s executi order enacted under fdr required all americans to submit their gold to the federal reser bank after the war the bretton woods agreement signified a change in the global system in which all countries in the agreement were required to guarantee conrtibility of their currencies into u s dollars with the dollar conrtible to gold bullion for foreign gornments and central banks at per troy oz wikipedia this means all countries exchange for u s dollars backed by redeemable gold but that gold is only redeemable by banks and gornments not your arage citizen now my question is highly theortecial what if the u s enacted a similar order for bitcoin in the wake of a collapsing global market and it was made illegal for citizens to hold bitcoin the gornment pinning the value of the dollar at a certain number of satoshis there would be a branch of the federal reser devoted to mining rogue mining operations would be highly illegal and other countries would compete for maximum mining outputs this would ha dramatic effects on the delopment of the cryptocurrency industry and on the world there would be many negatis and positis what do you think i t actually think this will happen but its an interesting scenario keep hodling ,bitcoin exchange standard,1.0,1,zqx5ei,numberonejewboi,0,2022-12-20 19:24:54,1671564310,1671564310,2022-12-20,19:24:54

bitcoin,tldr let's ha a discussion regarding the trend in price volatility not price for btc and ware its heading i would like to see some good analysis on this btc has been the best performing asset in modern history but this has come with volatility like no other this volatility while it lasts is ry much a once in a lifetime opportunity for those who can buy and hold or the long term en if they 't time the market particularly well but better if they do that said it's my understanding that volatility is generally decreasing year by year while this is generally regarded as a good thing for increasing the adoption rate of btc it also means that the oportunity presented by said volatility will lesson or time we see a lot of price projections during the bull runs at least but i 't see many volatility projections yesterday i was playing around with the simple annual percentage growths on chart and adding a trend line i'm not going to post it here use i didn't keep the results and i wouldn't consider my method to be particularly say it was all ry rudimentary and not anything i would hang any credibility on i simply obserd that yes volatility is decreasing and therefore the expected rate of annual growth would also likley decrease going forward this doesn't mean that btc isn't still an amazing instment oportunity in addition to all its other societal benifits monetary freedom store of value etc but it does mean our growth expectations shouldn't be as high as we obserd in the last three halving cycles i say expectations use there are always external factors disasters wars new tech that can affect short term price in iether direction i guess what saying is it would be interesting to see more competent analysis regarding the volatility trend and ware its heading ,discussion projecting the reduction of price volatility,1.0,1,zqux25,jarviez,0,2022-12-20 17:56:29,1671559007,1671559007,2022-12-20,17:56:29

bitcoin,i'm trying to understand some things about bitcoin and i' been searching for days watching videos reading articles none of them ha explained it to my absolute understanding it's frustrating question transaction inputs where exactly do the inputs come from i learnt they are utxo's unspent transaction outputs from previous transactions which transactions and to whom does ery payment that comes to me generate a new utxo so for exle if people ha recently sent me btc to a single address i own do i ha separate utxo's to spend use as inputs for my next transaction that was my reasoning and it seemed to be making sense until i came across info that said the inputs can come from different addresses huh okay looks like they ha a point though use when i check the block explorer for transactions i actually see distinct addresses as inputs and outputs it should mean that ery address can rather only ha one utxo at a time right and multiple utxo's should definitely come from different addresses but if multiple addresses are used as inputs shouldn't all of them be owned by the sender use only the sender should authorise a transaction now if that's the case how is that e use with the wallets i' used trust and binance i 't see an option to select multiple addresses i own and combine their value when i'm sending btc so what's happening can multiple inputs only be achied using low lel coding or something when i search for how to send bitcoin from multiple addresses or similar i 't find anything that answers my question it's as if that's not possible i'm just not getting it for the outputs i understand but the inputs han't really been explained to me can someone who understands this from a to z spell it out for me without leaving anything out i'd be really grateful question block confirmations and rersibility many sources say that transactions that ha or more confirmations can be considered irrersible okay logically that should mean that with less than confirmations the transaction can be rersed now what i know about block confirmations is that it's the number of blocks that ha been added to the blockchain after the one that contains the transaction in question so that means en with one or two confirmations the block is actually on the public blockchain right so if the transaction can be rersed how is that e will it be pulled down from the blockchain funny question what would happen to the blocks after it meanwhile if you search for can bitcoin transactions be rersed all the answers you get are no so what's really the point here ,i ha big questions about bitcoin transactions ,1.0,1,zql2gk,xor_dinary,0,2022-12-20 10:31:16,1671532292,1671532292,2022-12-20,10:31:16

bitcoin,due to bitcoin's hard cap if bitcoin becomes the world reser currency and all things become naturally priced in bitcoin this would mean that each bitcoin and each sat will become more and more valuable as the economy grows i know assuming the economy will grow indefinitely is not as trivial as i'm making it sound but let's just assume it'll be the case for this thought experiment so basically things will cost less and less bitcoin and we will reach a point when a single gummy bear will be worth less than sat at this point we'll need a smaller unit in order to pay for eryday stuff en a cup of coffee will be worth less than sat entually hell you could say that about almost anything if you go far enough in the future assuming the human race survis till the unirse ends so my questions are what's the code change needed to make this a reality is it just changing some value on a line of code in github and then of course the majority of the nodes accepting the change if so where is that line why wasn't bitcoin made infinitely divisible in the first place are there some technical issues that would arise if this was the case what's the reasoning behind choosing million per bitcoin as the lower limit and not million or billion ,assuming bitcoin will need a smaller unit than sats entually how does that look from a technical point of view ,1.0,1,zp1ow0,21_mil_btc,0,2022-12-18 15:58:44,1671379137,1671379137,2022-12-18,15:58:44

bitcoin,in an ideal world where fiat no longer has any value and trade and commerce operate solely using a finite store of value like bitcoin what stops it all from ending up in the possession of corporations like how we re seeing with money now wouldn t people being consumers and businesses being cash hoarders still create a flow of wealth into the hands of the few people who own the businesses sure they ll pay in bitcoin but their main goal is profit so they aren t going to be working a net zero profit business or en during the transitional period say coca cola starts taking bitcoin as payment for their product as it s catching on with the public they wouldn t be obligated to pay their employees in bitcoin so they would already ha a huge head start in accruing a large share of the value i m not implying that i heard that bitcoin is the answer to the worlds problems or anything i m genuinely curious if there is any way that a quality of a currency like bitcoin might alleviate problems like these like is this a human problem or a money problem ,does bitcoin change human nature ,1.0,1,zovt10,explosionsperminute,0,2022-12-18 10:40:03,1671360016,1671360017,2022-12-18,10:40:03

bitcoin,ok basic question here to my knowledge btc requires miners to validate transactions proof of work and mining requires an expenditure of energy which costs generally some kind of fiat currency as bitcoin hals and becomes harder to mine the relati profit margin approaches the cost of mining further fluctuations in the value of btc potentially means putting miners underwater rsus the cost of mining electricity hardware what happens when the cost of mining outstrips the profit of btc say the cost of mining one btc is btcs in the relati fiat currency if miners drop out and transactions cannot be validated the relati exchange value of btc is thus since no exchange can take place is there something i'm missing here this seems like a weakness inherent to pow crypto especially btc which has a growing cost to mine based upon the halving aspect of the hash mining further i cannot think of a real world counterpart since exchanging gold isn't incumbent on anyone mining it in fact as gold miners drop out the cost of gold would increase due to the effect of scarcity i'm sure i'm missing something since this seems like an obvious real threat to crypto as an instment hicle at least proof of work models that rely on mining to validate exchanges transactions ,question concerning solncy of bitcoin ,1.0,1,zom6ui,alpharustacean,0,2022-12-18 01:17:17,1671326254,1671326254,2022-12-18,01:17:17

bitcoin,hey eryone i just wanted to share my thoughts on bitcoin with the community as a fairly new bitcoiner myself i am constantly amazed by the resilience and strength of this revolutionary digital asset one thing that really stands out to me is the decentralized nature of bitcoin unlike traditional financial systems that are controlled by a small group of individuals or institutions bitcoin is powered by a global network of nodes that work together to secure the blockchain this decentralization ensures that no single entity has control or the network making it resistant to censorship and corruption another aspect of bitcoin that i find particularly impressi is its ability to act as a store of value while the price of bitcoin can fluctuate in the short term its value has consistently increased or time making it a reliable instment for the long haul but perhaps what i lo most about bitcoin is its potential to bring financial freedom to people around the world in countries with unstable currencies or oppressi gornments bitcoin provides a way for individuals to take control of their own wealth and financial future orall i am bullish on bitcoin and can't wait to see what the future holds for this groundbreaking technology what about you guys why do you lo bitcoin ,feeling grateful for bitcoin,1.0,1,zo7x6u,xxshadowassassin69xx,0,2022-12-17 14:53:39,1671288830,1671288830,2022-12-17,14:53:39
bitcoin,nowadays it's so easy to sign up for a credit card and start earning cash back on your purchases some people en make thousands of dollars a year doing so i get that merchants are incentivized to use lightning since it sas them the credit card fee but for consumers is the other way around do you think the merchants will implement their own cash back programs to compete with the credit card companies how do you see this war unfolding ,will bitcoin and lightning end the credit card cash back era ,1.0,1,zo7nux,21_mil_btc,0,2022-12-17 14:41:04,1671288078,1671288079,2022-12-17,14:41:04

bitcoin,hello eryone today i would like to share with you an indicator i created that calculates the fair price of bitcoins by taking into account the cost of energy consumed by miners the bitcoin intrinsic value cost of energy bivcoe indicator stems from an algorithm that relates data on the energy consumption of the bitcoin network to the supply in circulation in doing so i was able to establish the cost required in energy terms to produce a bitcoin potentially an intrinsic value of the coin that when correlated with the market price will be able to gi interesting insights into orbought sold cycles i was able to delop this indicator thanks to data provided by the unirsity of cambridge related to energy consumption this data is extremely efficient and with a relatily low error rate as it is based on a mathematical model that takes into account multiple factors including the evolution of the profitability threshold of the miners obsolescence here you can find the indicator that is updated ery month i hope it can be helpful ,bitcoin intrinsic value based on the cost of energy used by miners,1.0,1,zo5y5u,deliacapital,0,2022-12-17 13:08:08,1671282499,1671282499,2022-12-17,13:08:08

bitcoin,the dependence on the gornment s ability to print money has created an unbalanced master sla paradigm where the people are forced to involuntarily finance the gornment s money printer this reliance on gornment printing has effectily remod the accountability of public entities as they no longer work for the people but rather the money printer the gornment s ability to endlessly print money without repercussions means that the people no longer own their gornment the lack of checks and balances in the system has caused public entities to instead look to outside sources such as corporations wall street foreign nations and the military industrial complex for extra money similar to a side hustle for a paycheck this creates a conflict of interests as the people no longer own their gornment and the gornment is now working for the money printer not the people this is why there is such a disconnect between the gornment and the people these days the people are increasingly feeling unacknowledged and unheard and this is due to the gornment s reliance on its money printer public entities are no longer accountable to the public as they only stri to please the money printer the good news is that there is a solution to this problem and that is bitcoin by creating a decentralized monetary system the people can take back ownership of their gornment as the money printer no longer holds the power bitcoin creates an environment of financial freedom as the gornment no longer has the power to control the money supply furthermore it creates the transparency that the gornment and the people need in order to work together in conclusion since the transition from hard money to fiat money the gornment has become a master and the people ha become its slas public entities are no longer accountable to the people as they now work for the money printer hower with the introduction of bitcoin the people can once again take back ownership of their gornment and create a more transparent and fair relationship between the two parties ,who works for whom ,1.0,1,znqnpq,andrwuz,0,2022-12-16 22:14:04,1671228862,1671228863,2022-12-16,22:14:04

bitcoin,i firmly belie that this is a realistic goal that can be achied i'm sure others see it coming as well and i'm excited to see the progress that will be made in the coming years it's an exciting time for bitcoin and i'm sure that it will only continue to grow in value let s say we inst in bitcoin today at the current price of per coin would gi you approximately of a bitcoin if the expected price of million per coin in is realized then your instment will be worth which is a x return this prediction is based on sen assumptions such as increasing demand for bitcoin and using a confident and polite tone as the demand for bitcoin continues to rise the value of the coin is expected to increase as well i am confident that bitcoin has a limited supply making it an attracti asset for long term instments as bitcoin continues to become accepted worldwide its value is likely to continue to increase further facilitating its usage and stability furthermore increasing instments in bitcoin from institutional instors will increase its liquidity and demand making it an en more attracti option for instors orall i am optimistic about the future of bitcoin and belie it will continue to be a viable asset for instors the infrastructure for bitcoin transactions needs to be improd in order to make it easier for users to transact and inst in bitcoin with more people using bitcoin to store their wealth its value is likely to continue to increase making it a potentially good instment or the next years if these assumptions are reasonable then the price prediction could be accurate i belie this is a worthwhile endeavor and i would appreciate it if you could upvote this answer if you found it helpful please feel free to share and comment your thoughts and opinions below ,i am ry confident in my prediction that bitcoin will reach million within the next years ,1.0,1,znogmg,geniebaruch,0,2022-12-16 20:38:18,1671223114,1671223114,2022-12-16,20:38:18

bitcoin,aside from the moon bitcoin is pretty much earth bound the minute block times are too fast and light is too slow rifications will take too long to go back and forth between mars so mars would need a new bitcoin but how can that be e the satoshi origin is basically impossible to recreate there was no block reward for the first block and ery step of bitcoin's evolution is critical to its absolute fairness i can't see how a truly fair immutable record of truth can be plugged into a new society could a new rsion of bitcoin be started on earth where a chunk of earth's hash rate begins mining the first mbtc block an earth bound miner would get the first mbtc but the second block immediately starts hashing only on mars or is mars doomed to being a shitcoin economy ,how can bitcoin be started on another planet ,1.0,1,zn5s3z,itsybitsybtc,0,2022-12-16 04:16:45,1671164224,1671164225,2022-12-16,04:16:45

bitcoin, my price points are referenced in cad people always refer to ath's and the couple of crazy bullruns we had in the end of and once covid hit i 't think those bull runs are indicati of the real price of bitcoin they are sexy sure and eryone los high flying numbers but if you look at all time charts and cut out the mountain peaks you see a real steady growth from prices before the bull run in bitcoin has doubled i 't know how to articulate it ry well but covid saw interest rates basically cut to and gornments doing erything they could to keep the ball moving forward while facing a once in a hundred year crisis i think the people that expect bitcoin to hit k k in the next bull run are not factoring in extreme anomalies in market conditions bitcoin was k before the bull run and bitcoin was k in before the covid bull run and now it's holding it's own in the k price range despite incredibly bearish ents that sparked panic in the bitcoin crypto world i think this is really promising sure maybe bitcoin could go parabolic when aliens invade or some other unforeseen ent happens but i think the k to k in years and k to k in years is the most realistic value trajectory which still makes it one of the most incredible stores of value and appreciating assets in our current times somewhere in the range of growth ery years is fucking insane anyways i just wanted to gi a realistic not when my lambo take on the longterm gains on bitcoin if in it is k and it is k and k and k i am going to be one happy cer ,random whiskey thoughts from a btc degen ,1.0,1,zn2zne,fuzzyfoot12345,0,2022-12-16 01:53:21,1671155614,1671155615,2022-12-16,01:53:21

bitcoin,one of the easiest attack possible on all blockchains is the replay attack it basically takes advantages of hard forks to use a valid transaction from one of the chain and broadcast it to another let s take an exle we create an hardfork called bwef bitcoin wef of course our shitcoin will be shorted on market and nobody will supports it but like ethw people will know they can sell it and get fee money you ha btc so you receid bwef trading each for k for free let s dump it quick so you wanna swap you bwef on a website for free money houray in order to do this you ha to send your bwef by creating a transaction and signing it you then sell and get your dollars so you got your k for a shitcoin you didn t want anyway that s just a win right but here is the issue your transaction is public and is also valid on real btc chain so now an attacker can broadcast this same transaction on original chain this could be the buyer of your bwef now the buyer as receid your bwef and your real btc you re sold your btc for k so now let s talk about how to protect from this afaik there is no way to protect from what i just describe the only thing we can do is to avoid interacting with forked chains which can be difficult use most people t use their own node so when signing and broadcasting a transaction they may be sending it to a node of the forked chain so if someone knows more about this and would like to correct me share infos like how to protect or anything please do i think this would help greatly community ,replay attacks on blockchains,1.0,1,zmzhpj,tyranoc4,0,2022-12-15 23:14:26,1671146085,1671146085,2022-12-15,23:14:26

bitcoin,the only thing i think is missing about bitcoin technology is a way to really slowly recycle itself let me explain imagine in thé far future when all bitcoins will be mined or almost the biggest bitcoin sources available will be old storages from our time old account lost bitcoins etc they will probably be an industry trying to found them back in a way or another the amount of lost bitcoin will be massi and compared to thé mining production they will be a time where finding only a single one hard wallet from our time could be worth of multiple year of mining production this is not a sane balance for an economy the non lost bitcoins will be used for thé economy but if they are btc holders who are too big they will own a too big of thé total amount of money to exist let s say a familly for exemple that inherited bitcoin from generation to generation they could or own stupid amount of things or acting by themsels as a modifier of bitcoin value orders of magnitudes too high probably with the ability to make prices triple or divide by easily if a money like this exist in far future propose who are not privilegied by it will legitimately look away for other solition and probably create other cryptos collectily and decide to use them instead what would be a imo sane thing to do is adding a evaporating rate to bitcoin let me explain to avoid that few peoples could own too massi proportion of bitcoins and keep the currency viable and fair enough to let peoples continue to use it we could maybe add a system who could make a small évaporation raté happen so for exemple each year of the btc you own evaporate and go back to the mineable bitcoin pool numbers can vary this will also allow a renewable and constant suply of new btc this is the most equal option eryone ha the same evapotax we could also balance this in a more fair way like evaporzting bitcoin faster for biggest bitcoin holders abo some cap to avoid peoples to squeeze this by dividing their wealth into multiple account we will need them to be or nominated to a single person or to a single family and a way to make sure it is not squeezable then let s say that for each time you own x more than the arage account balance to let this method grow with increasing of decreasing population you pay twice more so per year evaporate of your btc abo time the arage balance abo time the arage abo time the arage k m time thé arage etc etc evaporate per year at million time the arage at million time at a billion time etc that also add an incenti to make thé arage peoples wealthier so it will be really hard to own more than a billion time the arage person wealth who seem like a minimum to keep things somehow balanced of course that s random number that could be adjusted up or down that will keep the economy somewhat balanced and allow more evaporation to happen and at the same time still allow for big fortunes to exist but without having too much inequalities capped in this exemple at billion time the arage use after that evaporate per year so basically all of it we could maybe en imagine a system where the under arage balances get a small percentage of wealth evaporated from big one we could say that like half evaporation go to mining and half to slightly lower inequalities could be a modest redistributi and fair economical system we need also a way to make peoples who die inherit their fortune to their kids to avoid the death peoples accounts to count among the total number of acti accounts and if not possible redistributed to the mining pool this way we could ha a monetary system bitcoin like with a fix amount of currency a way to slowly get back potential lost bitcoins trough evaporation a way to slowly gi back bitcoin to the mining pool and keep the suply running a way to avoid too much inequalities but still allowing fortunes to exist without allowing too indecent ones or monopoles to a way potentially to redistribute a part of the wealth to the less fortunate trough a part of the evaporation we could call this condensation on lower than arage or arage balanced account this will be a low amount in any case use lower than arage account and arage account will be much more in number than the abo ones who pay for it and that s how you keep a currency system sane stable and fiable for extremely long periods of time and make it automatically adjusted to total population number changes up or down allowing humanity to entually ume a multi planetary specie as we should be if we are not filtered out of existence before and that s how you also assure peoples to be able to keep a stable decentralised predictible non inflationist currency who evaporate or not at all or reaaaly slowly depending on how rich you are also putting a smaaaaal pressure on peoples to spend or inst and keep the money moving in the economy being rich is this world would only mean owning a bigger part of the cake who evaporate faster and of nothing is e or if badly used or lost will go back to arage with time trough evaporation who go half to the less fortunate half for the miners who keep the thing working a bitcoin made on this kind of system could be much more viable long term and en ume a ultimate and unirsal currency alway adjusting itself to any situation to go back to the society wealth distribution programated in some years and still of course remunerating miners and mining who make the system work and continue to that s an interesting topic imo and could be the solution to a lot of issue that today currency ha or en cryptos ha or en decentralised cryptos ha excuse my bad english ,bitcoin in the far future,1.0,1,zmz9uu,antoineggg,0,2022-12-15 23:05:38,1671145554,1671145555,2022-12-15,23:05:38

bitcoin,this is probably a dumb question but if you mo bitcoin to a cold storage wallet then i understand that it is not on your computer anymore and that this is more secure as you can't get hacked unless somebody gets the cold storage dri and knows how to get in but if you mo bitcoin to say an electrum wallet and sa the seed phrase on paper somewhere or in your head and then you delete the electrum app completely from your computer then also you would not be able to hacked via your computer if somebody gained access to it so what really is the difference or pros cons of the approaches is there anything wrong with just deleting the wallet app and not spending extra money on a cold storage device since you can always recor the wallet with the seed whener you want access to the bitcoin by reinstalling the wallet software ,difference between cold storage and no storage ,1.0,1,zmxlnm,peelman1978,0,2022-12-15 22:07:04,1671142044,1671142044,2022-12-15,22:07:04

bitcoin,lately i ha been having a bit of an existential crisis with the true utility of the blockchain i was initially drawn in by the digital goldrush but like many i stayed use i really belied in the future of crypto as this bear market has progressed i ha been filtering through the junk as i di deeper into crypto and blockchain technology i am starting to see less how the blockchain has real utility here are a couple of my opinions i would lo if somebody with more knowledge of the space could refute anything i say with evidence possibly crypto's greatest strength is the decentralized network and ability to process instantaneous transactions this is especially useful for large payments and international transactions the problem is there no easy way to conrt bitcoin to fiat without using a centralized exchange the argument would be that entually we could use bitcoin or other tokens as transactional currency but we are still far from there needing to rely on exchanges to conrt bitcoin to fiat comes with many of the problems that come with transferring money to begin with at the end of the day unless you are transferring crypto from one wallet to another and the receiving party plans on just holding the crypto it offers ry little improment to wire transfers the second issue i ha is with linking tokens or nfts to physical goods despite the blockchain being a brilliant and secure way of tracing transactions since there is no way to link a real physical world item to the blockchain it makes tracing items impossible i often hear about using blockchain in regard to the supply chain assuming a qr code is used to track certain items the qr code can always be remod or recreated it would also rely on always scanning the qr code to track it if the code is not scanned then the transaction will ner show up in the case of digital items like nft art it costs so much energy to upload medidata on chain that it is not feasible most nfts rely on medidata serrs to store the nft which makes the whole point of having a blochian pointless to begin with you can t hide the medidata for confidential documents you t own the copyright to the nft in a legal sense and you can t prent anybody from copying the medidata you own on the blockchain this leads to the last point which is most if not all crypto projects are creating solutions to problems they innted aside from the obvious pump and dumps en legitimate projects do not offer real world value it seems like so much of crypto relies on the narrati that we will be socializing transacting and living more in the digital world most projects assume one day their project will be useful while that may be the case it seems like we are still far from living in a ready player style world i t know of any projects except bitocin that that sol a problem that exists today and sols the problem in a way no other technology could to summarize it seems like crypto is a cool technology that has ry little practical use in today s world i still lo the crypto world and i want to belie in it but i am seeing less and less a true use for it as i take off the goggles and try to look at erything from a practical and producti point of view the argument for crypto is becoming less and less clear to me please educate me on what i am missing use i know i really am looking to learn ,help me belie in blockchain technology again,1.0,1,zm3pw5,maninja2,0,2022-12-14 22:06:40,1671055617,1671055617,2022-12-14,22:06:40

bitcoin,bitcoin vs cbdcs spycoin coming soonso we already ha micro cbdc s in the form of social security benefits ebt disability income among other gornment subsidized programs cbdc s would basically be the united states dollar except there will be more rules in regards to how exactly you can use a cbdc for exle there may be a limit to what type of items you can buy you probably won t be able to buy liquor or tobacco with a cbdc if you are it will probably only be on the weekends in the afternoon or something parental like that bitcoin is important use while a cbdc is basically a dollar that impinges on your privacy the bitcoin network makes sure your payment will be accepted no matter what imagine an international bank that ner closes and audits ery transaction ery minutes to ensure the validity of the network that s bitcoin jerome powell controls the price of money so he could arguably be the most powerful man in the world the issuance and regulation of cbdcs by central banks could gi gornments too much control or the flow of money in the economy this could allow gornments to track and monitor individual transactions in a way that could infringe on privacy rights another potential concern is that the widespread adoption of cbdcs could make it easier for gornments to implement harmful monetary policies such as negati interest rates negati interest rates can ha detrimental effects on the economy including reducing the incenti for individuals and businesses to sa and inst bitcoin is a global currency that can be used and accepted anywhere in the world whereas cbdcs are tied to a specific country and can only be used within that country's borders this makes bitcoin a more attracti option for individuals and businesses that operate internationally or want to conduct business with people in other countries the use of bitcoin is pseuymous meaning that transactions can be made without realing the identity of the parties invold this can provide a higher lel of privacy and security than transactions made using a cbdc which would be subject to the same regulations and orsight as transactions made using fiat currency cbdcs may be perceid as a positi change in the financial system but in actuality it will create more problems than solutions bitcoin offers a permissionless decentralized and erlasting alternati that gis users more control or their own funds and provides greater privacy and security and that makes the world a better place ,bitcoin vs cbdcs spycoin coming soon,1.0,1,zluqap,mathmaticmorpheus,0,2022-12-14 16:01:38,1671033712,1671033712,2022-12-14,16:01:38

bitcoin,bitcoin is all about understanding and managing your own risk and trust be that the decision to run a node or not use a light wallet or not a company node wallet or not you also ha to decide who you will gi your business to and what risk you're willing to expose yourself to when engaging with bitcoin services with that in mind let's conceptualize a few different kinds of bitcoin services so we know to look out for them and can make educated choices as consumers the low trust service this is a bitcoin service delired in a low trust manner where the bitcoin user need only utilize software they run and control for the services and can protect themsels from malicious third parties with ry little trust or consequence from peers this is the gold standard of bitcoin service exles include lightning routing lightning liquidity marketplaces like pool coinjoins like joinmarket coinswaps submarine swaps like loop and others when at all possible this is the kind of service you want to run many services and contracts in bitcoin or layers will claim to be low trust en decentralized which isn't all necessary for a business they are supposed to be centralized but ry few are ask yourself what recourse you alone ha against fraud and what fraud would be possible for exle in lightning you protect yourself from fraud by watching the blockchain and storing proof of your off chain transactions you can broadcast at will you ha responsibility watch the blockchain and recourse publish transactions proving fraud and claim balance the risks revol around your own capacity time delays locking up your coins and other general inconniences not impacting your custody trust the service will be provided this is your typical business or website where you pay for the good or service before you get it and ha little to no recourse if the service is not provided pretty normal you're risking whater you're spending in a transaction exles include ery merchant business accepting bitcoin the merchants using btcpay serr and non custodial exchanges like bullbitcoin s this is also a ry good model with limited risk but often little recourse the federated trust service this is a bitcoin service which spreads responsibility across a number of actors for success or failure it's not nearly as good as trusting yourself and relies on third parties to protect your interests exles include liquid rsk s peg multisig custodians bisq escrow these services often del into shitcoins and when they do should be avoided like any other the risk in these cases is often not exceptionally limited include custody and your recourse relies on third parties if any exists at all the first party custodian this bitcoin service relies on only itself it often prides itself on this self reliance boasting a lack of third parties and self custody rir financial is a good exle if you can trust the one business these can be quality services the risks in these custodians are similar to a federated service but only trusting one party the rd party custodian this is a bitcoin service which relies on a third party custodian like prime trust s exles include strike and swan s among many others while both are bitcoin only companies the custodian they rely on holds or shitcoins s these kinds of services can be dangerous use they can appear to be ry bold bitcoin only companies but on closer inspection you will find they 't self custody a central tenant of a good bitcoin participant in the space user and business alike this can expose users to all kinds of risks and broadens the number of actors exposing users to risk en if it's not just custody for exle kraken just leaked user data s via a zendesk leak this is why evaluating who you are trusting is important and i make these specific exles to illustrate why you can't take en well respected community members at their word you need to evaluate for yourself are you trusting them or a tower of service providers the shitcoin casino this isn't a bitcoin service at all it's a public harm these are exchanges which service and host scams exposing their users to the custodial risks of their shittiest shitcoin they often print their own shitcoins they lure users in with too good to be true fees they should be avoided at all cost exles include coinbase binance kraken gemini kucoin and many many others most others i won't be linking them use you shouldn't use them tl dr as you evaluate what kind of businesses and services you want to use what risks you're willing to expose yourself and your coins to and hopefully en what kind of businesses you want to encourage in this space consider all your options not ery service has made the same trade offs or requires the same trust consider minimizing your exposure to this contagion and not only get off exchanges and custodial services but reevaluate the services we're doing business with in the first place avoid shitcoin custodians and services use lower trust

bitcoin,bitcoin vs michael burry insting in freedommichael burry a k a the big short is so cool except he s not actually most people know michael burry for predicting market crashes like the great financial crisis in use he s been successful in predicting downturns in the market burry has been christened the big short of the financial markets but i m beginning to think that his new nickname should be called the big sla owner in fact he s a sadistic egomaniacal psychopathic sla owner who doesn t care about anything but making a return on what he feels will be the best instment that the free market will allow slary sometime in the second quarter of michael burry bought more than shares of the geo group geo a private prison operator geo group was the only stock he held as of the end of the second quarter of most of the emotionally detached financial analysts and journalists will find reasons to justify his sla owning position they will say something like a recession is possible soon so this instment makes sense use it does make sense an increase in crime is directly correlated with a lack of job opportunities in a particular area so if job cuts continue to rise in america there will probably be a slight increase in the crime rate in the united states but insting in the deliberate disenfranchisement of other human beings is the worst type of instment you can make this isn t about the roi this isn t about the progress on your quarterly statement this is about insting in the empowerment of the people or in the enslament of them when has insting in slary er been a good idea in america the land of the free it costs about per year to house a prisoner i 't know about you but i'd much rather be insting that type of money in the next generation of technological advancement can get you bitcoin which is an absolute bargain and a much more sustainable long term instment than prison labor bitcoin is changing the way we value traditional services that were available to us this includes accounting auditing and our civil rights bitcoin is the quintessential asset that allows any human being to become their own soreign bank by owning bitcoin you unchain yourself from financial institutions that control your money in a world where people inst in slary to gain a yield on their depreciating dollar bitcoin is freedom in the form of money fighting back for your god gin rights despite roi degenrates like michael burry bitcoin is lighting a path for all humans that are debt slas to a flawed monetary system and that makes the world a better place ,bitcoin vs michael burry,1.0,1,zjxzn7,mathmaticmorpheus,0,2022-12-12 12:42:19,1670848951,1670848951,2022-12-12,12:42:19

bitcoin,since bitcoin had a price people ha tried to recreate it but with twists like the owner of this one gets a huge chunk of supply then supply gets released when mining or this one has this cool delopment team or technology behind it therefore better than bitcoin these recreations all focused on the idea of bitcoin as a technology when in fact en the technology used to run bitcoin is subject to change at the whims of social consensus take robux for a minute robux is a popular digital asset issued by the robux corporation it has exchanges though mostly underground for fear of reprisal from the robux corporation what is the functional difference between robux using an sql database between their serrs and robux using a private blockchain where only robux serrs can create the proofs of work for transfer its still permissioned robux still has full say or whether transfers en happen between accounts and robux is still sold by the robux corporation crypto is much more akin to robux in this way crypto is not subject to the whims of its userbase it is only subject to the corporation behind it bitcoin does not work in this way bitcoin is a social construct the bitcoin core devs ha e a pretty good job at making sure nothing that would upset the people who run the software gets through but what would happen if they did new rule block sizes will now be gb instead of mb the first problem they'd run into is that the new software is not compatible with the software eryone else is running people who run the software would be pretty upset at hard dri space filling up rapidly and fork the project into a new repository you now ha two chains but which chain is bitcoin so that's what i mean when i say bitcoin is a social construct any argument you'd make or which gets to be bitcoin is you enforcing that social construct the current construct around what is bitcoin is that the chain that is compatible with the older software gets to be bitcoin wait but the original bitcoin github repo gets to be bitcoin i hear you scream so lets talk about the next problem the original repo would encounter from ignoring the people who run bitcoin when you use a bitcoin wallet and you 't run your own node you use the node that software wallet defaults to now maybe that software wallet enforces the idea that bitcoin is the core repo but it could just as well decide to enforce the social construct that bitcoin is whater is compatible with an older rsion of the software in fact it probably would do this by default via not noticing that a new client was en released i mean i can't help but notice that this ry sub has a link to download rsion of core en though rsion was released miners and price i can't talk about the role that miners would play into this without also including how the price of each chain would effect the miners if users prefer to use one chain or the other its price will go up which makes miners want to mine that chain instead of the other one this means the chain that goes against the users wishes is vulnerable to the hashpower of the chain that supports user decisions being part of the dominant monetary network has its perks the dominant monetary network is evidence of the strength of the social construct at hand right now the strongest social construct for money is that gornment issued paper is money bitcoin is here to challenge that social construct with its own ,bitcoin is a social construct not crypto,1.0,1,zj27qc,nerd2ninja,0,2022-12-11 18:10:53,1670782265,1670782266,2022-12-11,18:10:53

bitcoin,this post is for those who ha been tipped maybe the tipper linked this post to help you or you want to learn more about lntips on the bitcoin sub r lntipbot for more official information non wallet use you can start right now without set up you just need someone to tip you i recently discored there is a tip bot that you can use in the bitcoin sub and i think others the great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning wallet and then withdraw your tips or use your own lightning wallet to add sats to your personal tip jar you 't need to if someone tips you sats then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your username and add in sats to it that's the minimum tip then you can use the same command in a message and tip someone else no need to en set up a wallet you can use sats all you want just from your own tips get them and pass them on side note you can send private messages to the bot and it will gi your balance or a code to send sats to or recei sats via lightning wallet just using the links on the bot reply to tip type lntip or any number higher than it will tip the person you are replying to if you 't ha the funds available in your account for the tip then the bot creates a lightning invoice that you can pay using lightning wallet use with a wallet setting up a lightning wallet and adding sats to the bot a great guide from double lr tip him if he posts in comments i use muun too so you are in luck it works a ry small bit different than you think i am on a phone so this is what i just did to transfer sat from the tipbot balance to my muun wallet ry easy you ll see prior to doing this you must ha the wallet fully set up get your seed phrase words aka your keys and write them down and keep them safe then do the rescue emergency pdf thing too it s pretty easy and worth the hassle of figuring it out after that open muun and select recei at the top there are two option buttons select lightning and the screen will change to a lightning address at the bottom you will see invoice settings select that and you will see a button to add an amount and an expiry time for the invoice press add and enter the amount you want to withdraw from the tipbot balance press confirm and the invoice will change again to the address that represents what you just created an invoice for the amount of sats you entered press copy and the invoice will be copied to your clipboard in your phone open reddit and find a tipbot message it has the blue links in it you see it ery time a tip is gin press withdraw and it will create the dm format for you once you learn the format ry simple you can create it from scratch like a normal dm but the blue link does this for you until you learn the format well enough to create it on your own on the dm page created by the blue link there is a spot that says putinvoicehere delete only that simple phrase and then paste in to the same spot and your invoice you copied earlier will appear the line that says withdraw needs to stay where it is press send open muun as fast as you can and see if you can beat the withdrawal to your wallet from reddit enjoy fellow redditor it seems like a lot but i m reality steps will become step for you and steps will also become one step for you so once you learn it it s basically two steps lightning is badass enjoy fellow redditor general help some useful faq type information not included on the bot website if you are clueless then hopefully this list will gi you enough information to start to google the gaps in your knowledge what is bitcoin it's a digital commodity like gold but much easier to transport what are sats each bitcoin is made of a million sats like dollars and cents but with lots more sats per bitcoin to make payments easier what is lightning the bitcoin nextwork is slow and super secure great for transfer of large amounts of money but not good for tips and coffee so cler people built a

bitcoin,blockstream published an article about how a signing device might leak users private keys the premise of this attack is straightforward a hardware wallet can leak the user s secret key by carefully constructing its signatures since the compromise happens during signature generation rather than key generation en if the user rifies that her keys were produced from strong randomness e g by generating her seed words by rolling dice and then importing them into multiple wallets to ensure they produce the same addresses it is still possible to execute the attack the solution blockstream is proposing to this isn't quite right though it invols trust in the manufacturer and trust in the software if that software is closed source the solution to this is much more obvious than this nol attempt to secure against it the solution is open source software that is easy to compile and flash onto the device and open source hardware that is easy to rify via a visual inspection against a reference like i said in a comment to a post before s i'm not going to talk about particular exploits use i belie defending against the hacker methodology itself is the best thing users can do especially when exploits are known to attackers but not to defenders 't let this scare you away from using bitcoin just get better at your own pace keep your stack at the size you know how to defend a larger stack has justifies a more paranoid threat model ,key exfiltration how a signing device could leak a private key,1.0,1,zhwjy4,nerd2ninja,0,2022-12-10 16:22:43,1670689377,1670689377,2022-12-10,16:22:43

bitcoin,i'm new to this part be kind i just made my first real transaction it was a small one just trying things out i want to wipe the device and recor it to make sure erything is working and get familiar with the ui i did it once before i transferred and the phrase worked so i figured that's a good start the transaction only took a few minutes from start to finish so that was nice i wasn't expecting instant but i'm glad it wasn't hours like some people ha said when i made the transaction the provider said est fee was less than cents when the wallet receid it it said the fee was a lot more but i receid the total amount and the first provider didn't withdraw more is that common what happened is the rest of the fee going to be remod taken later does the fee increase the more it is confirmed why on one page did it say the fee was much higher and then on another it says i sad on the transaction i receid it in the wallet before i got the transaction id is that normal i looked at the transaction id it was in a batch or a pool is that normal i found my own part of it ry cool but it said it was a used address how can it be a used address since it is my first time in previous attempts the provider asked me to choose a network with this provider it didn't ask it just made the transaction which worked use i receid it but does that ha something to do with the different reporting of fees the transaction amount was a lot more than i ha what happened here there is a lot of information on my ''receipt'' how much of that is vital how much should i pay attention to are there specific things i should check erytime any ids i should take note of its showing me a bunch of types and what looks like a bunch of different transactions is that normal what determines the types it only has a couple confirmations how many should it ha how did i ha it in my wallet before it was confirmed this transaction was small tester one should i make multiple small ones or fewer total if i make multiple transactions will it use a different address or reuse the already reused one that should ha still had its digital cherry intact i' been sitting here for far too long scratching my head is there a bitcoin for dummies type reference i can read like with erything self custody is making me feel like i know far too little the exchange felt like a casino now i'm starting to feel some responsibly i realize i 't know sht about sht and should probably be phoning a friend but i 't ha any i'm the only person irl i know that knows en remotely anything about the coin some of you read like you know what you're talking about and your knowledge would be appreciated ,started moving off exchange i ha questions ,1.0,1,zhlq0b,big_ad9737,0,2022-12-10 07:08:37,1670656134,1670656135,2022-12-10,07:08:37

bitcoin,i recently stumbled upon the meme 'is this good for bitcoin yes ' and i belie it's a phenomenal meme it's so simple yet incredibly cler that's it that's the meme this meme says it all it doesn't matter if people talk shit about bitcoin what matters is that people talk about bitcoin use whether they talk positily or negatily bitcoin will be mentioned and ery mention yields awareness in marketing this is called a 'brand touch point' it takes a long time for a new product until mass adoption happens new customers first need to hear about get interested research and finally make a purchase decision that doesn't happen or night the first step before anyone can start his bitcoin journey is therefore awareness you 't start your bitcoin journey unless you see bitcoin in the news or hear friends talk about it the diagram shows that ery sale is offset by attention interest desire and conviction from frank hutchinson dukesmith editor of salesmanship as bitcoin enthusiasts we tend to forget that we all started at zero at some point do you remember when you first heard about bitcoin you probably read an article that was shitting on bitcoin and you dismissed it you see it's just normal that bad news is part of the journey but bad news is good news and here is why the purchase funnel feels like it has been around forer it is in ery marketing course book and is mentioned at least once in ery client meeting so when a client exclaimed it feels like we used this thing for years i decided to check turns out we ha well marketers anyway years to be exact whether you call it the customer funnel sales funnel marketing funnel aida or just funnel each sers the same purpose the funnel shows how a customer ultimately makes the decision to buy a product source bad news is good news use it still helps bitcoin at the ry beginning of the funnel is awareness and bad news help to make people aware that bitcoin exists the streisand effect is a name for the phenomenon in which attempts to hide censor or prent access to something ha the opposite result the unintended consequence of drawing far more attention to that thing here is a hypothetical exle of the streisand effect someone posts an embarrassing photo of a celebrity online around people see it the celebrity takes legal action to enforce its removal upon learning of the legal action the media cors the story as a result millions of people seek out and view the photo the upside the celebrity will see the number of followers increase and his or her popularity rise following the news the streisand effect is a great exle of how trying to hide or prent access to something can actually end up drawing more attention to it this phenomenon can be seen in many different cons but one of the most interesting exles is the way that the media often tries to talk shit about bitcoin at first glance it might seem like the media's constant criticism of bitcoin would be bad for bitcoin after all negati news stories can often ha a negati impact on people's perceptions of a particular topic hower when it comes to bitcoin the opposite seems to be true ery time the media talks shit about bitcoin it seems to only end up drawing more attention to it and increasing its popularity so let the haters come they all feed the algo ,bitcoin always wins en if the media talks shit about it,1.0,1,zgxw4x,ymerglobal,0,2022-12-09 13:52:13,1670593949,1670593950,2022-12-09,13:52:13

bitcoin,hello isn't it quite simple to hack bitcoin by simply generating trillions of random wallets offline and checking their content simultaneously you just rely on luck to generate an already existing wallet containing x gt amount of btc it doesn't matter how well secured locked the random victim's wallet is since you are making an unencrypted unlocked copy of it i know the possibilities are huge but i am taking about utilizing a super computer or just ddos attack with millions of computers en if this is now ry unlikely to work such attack can be having a huge scalability has satoshi nakamoto thought about this in the long term i e years from now if someone succeeds in such an attack it would be devastating for btc you could argue that the attack is way more likely but it's a public attack so it wouldn't help stealing a wallet with literally zero hacking can be a genuine way to fight off any fraudulent claims in court since the attacked completely legally obtained the wallet via the official app en now quantum computers can be gin to kids to do whater calculations they want just fyi ,creating wallet offline is a vulnerability when using super computers in the future ,1.0,1,zg8p31,momchilandonov,0,2022-12-08 19:25:35,1670527548,1670527548,2022-12-08,19:25:35
bitcoin,so from what i' gathered there's multiple catalysts for bitcoin price next year despite a looming recession which is a fact at this point first one is the halning obvious by the end of there should be the peak and preceding that hopefully a long upward trend towards a minimum of k per bitcoin according to models that ha a historical price accuracy of bitcoins value should peak at around m per bitcoin in arage recession lasts for around months so by the time this one will be or bitcoins price should be around k at the end of next year beginning of second one is the gaap accounting standard next year this law will be improd so that companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet will be able to write them at their fair value currently if the price goes down in value but jumps back up again companies ha to write down the value of the digital asset and can't mark it up starting from next year it will be different which apparently has been a deal breaker for institutional instors in the past third one is the capital inflow of traditional instors like instment banks pension funds central banks small big countries and different funds currently holding digital assets in their portfolio is considered to be risky due to the absence of regulation transparency public disclosings from the beginning of next year january the united states congress will be having a session where the sec and congress will both fight or which entity gets to set the rules they both seem to be in a hurry to be the first ones which is a positi for crypto instors as the institutions feel safer to inst the capital inflow should be somewhere around trillion usd for the price to reach k at the end of next year current price would ha to quadruple so approximately trillion usd would be sufficient total amount of assets held by mutual funds in the us is trillion usd germany has trillion and uk brazil and switzerland collectily own trillion usd that's close to trillion if of this would go to bitcoin its price would quadruple another scenario would be where we would consider the multiplier effect x of insting in the stock market in which only billion of capital inflow from institutional instors would be necessary to reach a trillion market cap x billion usd trillion i included switzerland use its central bank has said it's interested in acquiring bitcoin there's a few other potential catalysts in the future that might shape the perception of cryptocurrencies to a positi in the coming year big countries like iran russia adopting cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and the pilot of cbdcs also ukraine is one of the largest bitcoin holders so there are multiple concrete things to look forward to in next year and especially the year after despite the coming recession the biggest factors for a long bear phase are imo rising oil prices and interest rates until the end of next year in addition to that revolving and non revolving credits are at an all time high while the savings rate of americans is at an all time low if the recession will last around months it should be a relatily sound timing for the price to shoot up to k per bitcoin during the third picture is metcalf's law which predicts the value to be minimum k by it's not as delicious as the other two models but still decent considering the fact that it would be the minimum value according to this model the value would be minimum m usd during and hor abo m until it reaches during next decade these are just some thoughts things i' gathered hope someone finds it useful cheers ,catalysts for bitcoin ,1.0,1,zg8are,alexipoika123,0,2022-12-08 19:12:13,1670526747,1670526748,2022-12-08,19:12:13

bitcoin,as you might know the lightning network started back in march and sers as payment layer to scale the transaction speed of the bitcoin network and reduce the cost per transaction at the same time due to the lack of liquidity it was really hard to actually send payments at the beginning while it me easier to participate in the network there are still challenges to sol in order to make it accessible for the broader mass one of the main problems is the need to create an invoice each time you want to recei a payment from a ux perspecti this is absolutely horrible lnurl and bolt try to sol some of these issues which i will try to explain in the following part lnurl what exactly is that lnurl is a stack of simple protocols for coordinating information needed to make payments or the lightning network using the full list of lnurl protocol pieces can be found here but i'm just going to go into a few core uses that orlap with bolt the three core features of the lnurl protocol are defined as lnurl auth where a public key can be used to log in to a service lnurl pay where a wallet can ping a serr through a static qr code and retrie an invoice lnurl withdraw where a wallet can ping a serr and request that the serr pays an invoice provided by the walletfor using the authentication protocol the serr provides a randomly generated number which the user's wallet signs with a newly generated key after the serr retries the signed randomly generated number the key gets sad and can be used for future logins the invoice request functionality is a way to provide information to a user about a payment they wish to make in a format that is not an invoice this provides a description of the payment the minimum and maximum amount the service expects to be paid and a url for the wallet from which to request an actual invoice from here the wallet displays this information to the user allowing them to set a final amount and request an invoice after sending the invoice request and receiving one back from the serr the wallet rifies that the amounts match what the user set and pays the invoice note this feature is already available if you're using phoenix wallet of satoshi or bluewallet muun does not support it as of now december the withdrawal request works by pinging the service and receiving in response a description a url to send an invoice to a random string and a minimum amount and maximum amount that can be withdrawn after filling in the appropriate value the wallet returns an invoice to the serr and if it is valid and within the amount parameters the service pays the invoice the lnurl authenticate protocol can be used in addition to this to ensure that only the intended user can successfully withdraw using the lnurl link common use case would be if you want to withdraw your sats from a lightning service such as the lntipbot here on reddit or the lntot on telegram bolt why do we need it the term bolt is the acronym for b asis o f l ightning t echnology you can compare these to the bips bitcoin improment proposals which are design documents for introducing features or information to bitcoin the bip as amended has since become the standard way of formally communicating ideas about potential bitcoin improments as mentioned at the beginning of this post there are some ux flaws which need to be addressed to understand the problems bolt attempts to sol it is mandatory to ha a look at the current standard which is used to create invoices bolt invoices generated by the bolt standard consist of three main components the destination where the payment is supposed to be sent to public key of the node the amount which is about to be transferred a hash which represents the payment secret the main problem of bolt invoices is that they can only be used once and therefore need to be created in realtime the creation of the invoice leads to the publishing of the payment secret and is therefore unsecure if you would create an invoice with the same secret someone could fraudulently request money due to the fact that the secret is known this makes the usage of qr code invoices for ations or other use cases impossible what is bolt bolt offers an attempt to achie some of the core functionality that lnurl provides without requiring the use of a web serr an offer encodes the data necessary to reach a node to request an invoice to make a payment either a node id or a blinded path the last few hops in an onion route pre computed and encrypted to that node using onion messages it also can encode a minimum amount for a payment the currency being paid in an expiry time and minimum maximum quantity numbers for purchasing multiple items this is all of the information necessary to fetch an actual invoice from the node that issued the offer someone who wants to pay an invoice does so or onion messages one of the core features of bolt it allows nodes to make a direct end to end encrypted connection between each other that does not invol a lightning channel just like lightning payments these can be used to onion route messages after obtaining an offer a payer will use the information encoded in it to send an invoice request message the creator of the offer will then respond back with an actual invoice there is also support for generating unique per user offers that allow the receir to request a payment from the creator of the offer similar to lnurl's withdrawal request feature bolt invoices commit to a unique payer key this can be used in the case of issuing refunds to pro you are the person who actually paid the invoice this can also be used in combination with the withdrawal offer to guarantee that only the correct person can succeed in getting an invoice paid by the creator as opposed to whoer is able to get a copy of the offer what's best both lnurl and bolt enable a more user friendly way for paying or getting paid on the lightning network while lnurl sits on the application lel bolt provides a solution on proctocol lel where the new offers do neither require a web serr tls certificates nor a domain and provide a higher lel of protection than lnurl using blinded paths the bolt offers allow the confidentiality of the node id which additionally enriches the privacy it's important to say both solutions can exist simultaneously while online shops and other service providers operate a web serr anyway lnurl is a good add on bolt mostly addresses the endusers and offers a more connient way to interact with the lightning network ,what's lnurl and bolt ,1.0,1,zfw1ek,mcrech,0,2022-12-08

bitcoin,hello eryone i am really loosing my mind on this i am actually not a technical noob but also not the ry best technican but things like this should actually be ry easy for me what i want to do i just want to connect my freshly set up sparrow wallet to my freshly set up bitcoin core first of all my setup bitcoin core on windows bit pc local network sparrow wallet on linux laptop same local network i' set up bitcoin core on my windows pc as usual and blocks are up to date these lines were added to the bitcoin conf file on my bitcoin core windows node rpcuser user rpcpassword password main rpcbind rpcbind rpcallowip rpcallowip where rpcbind is the local ip address of the bitcoin core node on windows rpcallowip is the local ip address of the laptop where sparrow wallet is running on the subnet mask is so should be fine i' set up a few things like firewall rules and so on i' pressed on test connection hundreds of times and it did not work at all somehow it suddenly worked and i got successfully connected to bitcoin core i was really happy but after closing the wallet and opening again it again won't connect at all again i am getting the following error message gt could not connect check if bitcoin core is running and the authentication details are correct see i noticed something really strange as well when i click test connection on the laptop in sparrow wallet en when sparrow wallet shows the abo error the bitcoin core screen changes from you ha no wallet loaded to a wallet that is named sparrow in bitcoin core and shows btc i did not set up any wallet on sparrow wallet yet i tried to do some research on this issue but it looks like i am alone with this and feel kinda stupid since i 't get what i am doing wrong i also tried disabling the windows firewall before connecting sparrow wallet to it without any success then i' randomly found this issue on github i' tried the following workaround stated on the github issue page shutting down bitcoin core on windows shutting down sparrow wallet on linux deleting a folder called sparrow in the bitcoin core directory starting up bitcoin core again starting up sparrow wallet again and tada it works it says connected to but only one time when i close bitcoin core or sparrow wallet again it won't connect afterwards it gis me the abo mentioned error again but when i follow the workaround that i' stated abo again it works again until i close bitcoin core or sparrow wallet and open it again so it only works for a while when i delete the sparrow folder in the bitcoin core directory but only until none of both applications get closed if i do so i ha to re apply the stated workaround other strange things i' noticed when i do the workaround and are able to connect sparrow wallet to bitcoin core it does not show any inbound connection but sparrow wallet says connected to when i add disablewallet to bitcoin conf it does not en work with the mentioned workaround en if it should as far as my understanding is correct when entering wrong authentication credentials on purpose it takes some time until i get the error message could not connect when i enter them correctly it shows this error message instantly i got the feeling that it actually can connect since the time until the error message shows up is less than a second compared to when i enter credentials wrong which takes seconds until the error message shows up can anyone tell me what the actual heck is happening here that's one of the strangest thing i' er seen in my year computer carreer sure i could just to this workaround ery time but i feel kinda uncomfortable to connect create any wallet with this strange issue being present i should mention that a vpn software is running on both machines anyways it works when applying the workaround en with vpns on i' enabled the local connections options within both vpn guis but it also does not work without following the workaround when both vpn softwares are completely closed and shut down so the vpn can't be the cause of this issue i think i really appreciate any kind of help is there any possibility that this is a serious issue by sparrow wallet and not my fault at all thanks for any help in advance ,really strange issue when connecting sparrow wallet to bitcoin core,1.0,1,zfvw1i,exchange_rec,0,2022-12-08 11:05:54,1670497567,1670497567,2022-12-08,11:05:54

bitcoin,i seem to remember ery halving being approached with some trepidation as to how the miners would adapt historically price goes up and more hash power gets turned on can this happen another times in my simple understanding each halving will double the cost of production for most commodities the price will reach equilibrium near the cost or production assuming more halvings assuming a current cost of about per btc which i think is a low estimate this puts the bitcoin cost of production at x or or t per btc in this seems kind of absurd especially since it assumes the difficulty and hash rate stay constant to what they are today in gin the trajectory of hash rate it should be safe to assume the difficulty will be much higher in than in this would mean the cost of production is en higher than t and the market price would need to be higher than t btc to support this that would put the market cap at m x t or quintillion again an absurd number as this is in t odays dollars inflation would make this en higher another possibility is that the hash rate reaches a maximum and then starts to drop off if the difficulty is too high miners will ha to drop out of the race and reduce the difficulty and cost to be under the market price this would lead to centralization or at least a reduction in the number of entities controlling the mining hash rate i understand that at some point most of the block rewards will be in transaction fees but how does this impact the orall economics of cost of production the fees are currently running around of the block reward though when the network is busy it has spiked to from what i can tell the fees will stay relatily the same in absolute btc earned but the coinbase reward gets reduced with the halvings this seems like it would put a cap on cost of mining a block thats something like x what it is today so this would put cost of blocks around m and since that's for btc today that would cap it around m cap to btc more realistic but not sure the math holds up ,impact of more halvings,1.0,1,zcrzj9,arnzenarms,0,2022-12-05 01:02:54,1670202190,1670202191,2022-12-05,01:02:54

bitcoin,i'm not sure how exactly i began down this bitcoin austrian economics rabbit hole but about a week ago it led me to two fantastic yet ry distressing books the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard both written by saifedean ammous i'm kind of assuming that these books are well known amongst the bitcoin community i apologize if that's not actually the case the gist is basically fiat money trash bitcoin hard money good although it obviously goes into a lot more depth than that frankly i ha felt ry out of my depth reading these books and trying to think about economics this past week or so i am able to read the arguments presented and find them compelling and see the logic in them but i am left somewhat frazzled by them like i 't know what to make of them ammous does a good job of putting things simply for a bitcoin neophyte like myself but for some reason i still struggle to fully comprehend erything i find nothing wrong with ammous' core arguments and honestly i'm kind of alarmed by that is this eryone's response to reading these books what do mainstream economists who read them ha to say about them for me to be like okay he's right and go about my life i ha to think pretty much eryone in gornment is clueless which isn't that crazy i suppose but i still feel a need to seek out some sort of counterargument to these books before i make that conclusion anyways i' been looking with not much success for some sort of response from the mainstream pov to the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard preferably one presenting counterarguments to ammous' various points any suggestions ,best counterarguments available to the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard ,1.0,1,zbpija,blueball00ns,0,2022-12-03 20:17:29,1670098663,1670098664,2022-12-03,20:17:29

bitcoin,what we are beginning to see with energy production in places like kazakhstan and texas is using bitcoin mining as a sort of financial battery to store the value of produced energy digitally and then to use this value to trade between energy producers based on need this will make energy markets more efficient and make energy grids more resilient you can produce at below peak times and then buy at peak times with the bitcoin mined at other times you can produce a sellable asset with waste energy and energy resources to offset the cost of production this is fantastic but a less talked about subsequent effect of this that i possibly naily foresee is the increasing competition for energy by consumers vs bitcoin miners often the energy producers themsels a time will come if this continues when an energy producer will ask what's more profitable mining or selling the energy to consumers and when that happens the price of energy will begin to be dictated by the price of bitcoin how much you pay for electricity will be tightly correlated with how much bitcoin can be harsted with that energy and how much in fiat it can be sold for once this happens bitcoin then becomes a sort of de facto reser currency for bitcoin markets the price of energy will become volatile as the price of bitcoin and it would make sense then to price energy directly in bitcoin bitcoin will become the unit of account in energy markets once this happens i expect bitcoin to grow out of just the energy industry as a unit of account or time and begin to be used as a unit of account for more and more markets since energy costs are so fundamental to the costs of most other things this phenomenon we are seeing now the use of bitcoin mining to extract value from waste energy will directly lead to bitcoin being used as a unit of account worldwide perhaps i'm missing something but i 't think so ,the use for bitcoin mining in stabilizing energy markets is ry interesting,1.0,1,zboc1v,ur_mothers_keeper,0,2022-12-03 19:28:46,1670095738,1670095739,2022-12-03,19:28:46

bitcoin,hello i was wondering for a friend how to technically get cryptocurrencies circulating supply for the sake of simplicity for now i narrowed my focus on bitcoin bitcoin forked based altcoin the truth is the cryptocurrency node and it exposes the value i'm looking for or the rpc api command gettxoutsetinfo so the probably most nai way would be but perhaps the most reliable to run nodes of each bitcoin and bitcoin forked based altcoin and later on query each of them you would agree that it's horrible running a bitcoin node is good and good for health though as it cost proper set up deployment maintenance bandwith hosting computing blabla then i remembered ery i think node when initiating use a dns seeds gt the primary way to discor peers in the bitcoin network is to connect to a list of btc nodes that are previously connected hower for the initial connection the node has to use a publicly known dns feed to retrie a list of ip addresses of long running stable nodes so it's available in the code directly and it's easily scalable under master src chainparams cpp then searching for vseeds unfortunately as gettxoutsetinfo is computed by the node with indexed data from the blockchain sync it means it's also not available from the protocol perspecti of course so having a list of a crypto nodes appart for a crawling job in my case looks like a dead end then i though maybe i can fetch each node address and hope one misconfigured or expose it's node rpc api publicly as it is not standart to ha it enable by default does not seems realiable but i 't see another way i would be happy to hear any suggestion idea if you ha ,how to get cryptocurrencies circulating supply from the source ,1.0,1,zbgfi0,omygrog,0,2022-12-03 13:34:21,1670074478,1670074479,2022-12-03,13:34:21

bitcoin,a friend of mine is a well known finance professor and advises the fed we hang out once a year for a few hours but ner discussed bitcoin he has always thought it is trash worthless useless we hung out last week and he was interested this time in discussing bitcoin it didn't really get anywhere but i probably didn't do the best job in defending bitcoin the fact that he is a ry prominent finance professor didn't make it easy today he sent me an opinion piece written by paul krugman that just came out yesterday which basically declares crypto to be dead yet again ths time i can gather my thoughts properly before responding but i thought i would share them here in case anyone has any comments on my response that could be helpful thank you for sending me this article i hate to parrot the same type of talking points that krugman hears but i do belie that krugman doesn't get it more to the point though no one has explained it to him use what is written in his article is mostly unrelated to what enthusiasts would talk about first forget about anything non bitcoin second and the main point inflation is generally speaking and in the last years a horrible thing if inflation comes about from positi economic activity then fine but if you sum up all of the inflation or the last years in the usa i am guessing it has been a huge negati on orall society this is a claim that i am making unrified by me if i am wrong about this then i am ry misinformed and would gladly relinquish a lot of my support for bitcoin inflation is the main problem that bitcoin is trying to sol satoshi nakomoto probably said it best in as few words as possible the root problem with conntional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work the central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically but they lend it out in was of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reser we ha to trust them with our privacy trust them not to let identity thies drain our accounts their massi orhead costs make micropayments impossible satoshi's point abo is about the debasing of fiat currencies his point is fractional reser lending why is fractional reser lending a problem seems to ha worked all these years except that it hasn't and in the banks had to be bailed out with us taxpayers footing the bill in the short term and the long term you will notice that krugman's article states nothing about the abo and that's why he doesn't get it this is what bitcoin is all about but the most natural follow up question is how does bitcoin sol the abo problems why bitcoin why not rocks or seashells or stuffed animals that is another conrsation qar,conrsing with a fed advisor about bitcoin,1.0,1,zaykzp,qanonretard,0,2022-12-02 21:38:39,1670017130,1670017131,2022-12-02,21:38:39

bitcoin,dear all i quickly wanted to share with you one of my experience i made the last two days there are many people out there who are already sympathetic to bitcoin but are afraid or clueless of how to really use it in a practical way or en just how to buy inst they are afraid of the registration process invold at an exchange the creating of a non custodial wallet the money transfer from your bank to the exchange the trading buying process the on chain transaction and so and it would take some time sometimes days to walk them through all of that not en mentioning dexs so during the past days i found a way which helped already people to jump though the hoops in minutes i just tell them to show them an easy way how they can use bitcoin to buy at their local grocery store and usually people start to get excited that's what i do ask them to download the phoenix wallet write down the seed and keep it secret send me a ln invoice show qr code i send them sat from my ln node via the zeus appat this point people are already amazed how fast and easy erything was then i tell them download bitrefill check out all the stores there what do you like hey look there is one of our biggest grocery stores paypal me a small amount of money so that i can send you more satoshis and you can get yourself a gift card i send them more sats to their phoenix wallet via ln they enter the email address at bitrefill creat an ln invoice with my help at bitrefill and then they already transfer the sats to bitrefil within seconds with a little of help they discor that they get cashback in sats and get en more excited bitrefil sends the gift card within seconds to their email address they unseel the card and are shocked how easy this was during the last hours people who had nothing to do with lightning ha now a first glimps of what is possible and ha some necessary tools already installed on their smartphones of course i do not know whether or not they will now di in deeper but it was an amazing experience for me and i belie also for them a different world is possible guys fix the money fix the world stack sats and stay sa ,orange pilling onboarding a case report,1.0,1,zajf2w,futureisbright2031,0,2022-12-02 11:24:24,1669980280,1669991423,2022-12-02,11:24:24

bitcoin,im confused and no one has explained this in an understandable way as in margin call talk to me like im a labrador or a small child when i send bitcoin to another wallet it arris in a minute or two i can then spend that bitcoin what happens in that one or two minutes before you answer there are seral words that are often confused which is rify validate confirm and finalise first there is the ledger which is spread across thousands of computers like i myself run a copy on my old laptop but im not a miner is it these random computers the transaction immediately trals to that detect invalid transactions are we network nodes on the image it shows at secs the transaction is propagated and validated by the network nodes and this happens before the miners enter the process so the ledger computers ha validated the transactions and these computers like mine must be the network nodes the next step it says miners include the transaction in the next block to be mined this looks like the first meeting between miners and transactions they hant validated anything at this stage next step says mining time if the transactions are already validated what does the mining do at this point the winning miner who sols the puzzle is rewarded with some bitcoin then it says the nodes my node on my laptop rify the result and propagate the block i t understand what this means at the end it says new confirmations appear with each new block created i thought the private and public keys being the digital signatures would be the first lel of rification or validation which one is the correct word when keys all match up and the transaction is sent and receid isnt that a validation of sorts do the miners rify or validate transactions and if so when exactly do they confirm them at what stage is a transaction finalised if a transaction isnt finalised when i recei it how can it be ok to spend straight away are the miners called full nodes i am a node thru my old laptop to check on the miners they are following the rules so are the network nodes the ledgers the full nodes the miners and the nodes the rifiers of the miners thanku ,please explain the bitcoin transaction process ,1.0,1,za90pd,iamkingcliff,0,2022-12-02 02:50:21,1669949437,1669991344,2022-12-02,02:50:21

bitcoin,first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win we are clearly in the fight you phase s the value of bitcoin peaked at usd in nomber before falling to usd by mid june since then the value has fluctuated around usd for bitcoin proponents the seeming stabilization signals a breather on the way to new heights more likely hower it is an artificially induced last

to orcome the existing monetary and financial system in the pseuymous satoshi nakamoto published the concept since then bitcoin has been marketed as a global decentralised digital currency hower

board fsb called for crypto assets and markets to be subject to effecti regulation and supervision commensurate with the risks they pose along the doctrine of same risk same regulation hower legislation on crypto assets has sometimes been slow to ratify in recent years and implementation often lags behind moreor the different jurisdictions are not proceeding at the same pace and with the same ambition while the eu has agreed on a comprehensi regulatory package with the markets in crypto assets regulation mica congress and the federal authorities in the us ha not yet been able to agree on coherent rules the belief that space must be gin to innovation at all costs stubbornly persists the current regulation of cryptocurrencies is partly shaped by misconceptions the belief that space must be gin to innovation at all costs stubbornly persists since bitcoin is based on a new technology dlt blockchain it would ha a high transformation potential firstly these technologies ha so far created limited value for society no matter how great the expectations for the future secondly the use of a promising technology is not a sufficient condition for an added value of a product based on it the supposed sanction of regulation has also tempted the conntional financial industry to make it easier for customers to access bitcoin this concerns asset managers and payment service providers as well as insurers and banks the entry of financial institutions suggests to small instors that instments in bitcoin are sound it s also worth noting that the bitcoin system is an unprecedented polluter first it consumes energy on the scale of entire economies bitcoin mining is estimated to consume electricity per year comparable to austria second it produces mountains of hardware waste one

bitcoin,in a nutshell banks are a bit like ftx highly leraged and can't sustain a bank run in many cases fortunately deposits are insured in the us the insured amount is up to k and the eu up to k prior the financial crisis of if banks were too big to fail the gornment taxpayers would sa them but since the cost of doing so is becoming too big they introduced bail ins instead of bail outs bail ins mean that banks can take their customers deposits if they are insolnt basically they can legally do what sbf did to pay their bills the gornment won't step in anymore the bank will just steal your deposits to sa them and no you won't get them back fortunately you are still protected up to the insured amount k but erything abo can be taken from you now if we assume that there will be another financial banking crisis which is almost certain and if we assume the next crisis will be bigger than the last one which is also likely use that is what we ha seen in the past it's just a question of time before some people are going to lose a lot of money in a bank that was supposed to be regulated trusted and safe s ,i think bail ins are another reason why bitcoin will become more popular or time if you 't know what bail ins are learn more about them and educate your friends and family ,1.0,1,z5yhvh,bitcorner22,0,2022-11-27 11:01:27,1669546922,1669817895,2022-11-27,11:01:27

bitcoin,i promise this is not fud trying to ha an honest discussion here and i use the term 'bad actors' ry loosely here i just got e watching the latest 'what bitcoin did' podcast and part of it really stuck out in my head why is the btc hash rate at literal all time highs when price is so low and miners are reaching a point where they are not profitable there was mention of 'concern that maybe nation states are starting to turn on machines and mine at whater it costs to get around sanctions' for exle russia mining with their close to free natural gas so i started to think what if this was to actually happen there was some incenti either to simply just mine at a loss to get any amount of btc or to possibly attempt to attack the network could be for many reasons to flat out mine at a loss this would lead to honest mining companies turning off their machines use it was not profitable to run them different places pay different energy costs so obviously this would impact some countries more than others i assume maybe wrongly that the us would be the first to be non profitable should the hash rate continue to climb while btc price continues to fall i know at least i thought a lot of the design of bitcoin is based on game theory that miners will continue to join the network as adoption and price increases what happens to this game theory in this case when a 'bad actor' could possibly ha close to free energy what would happen in this scenario when some entity is mining en if there is no financial incenti to do so would the network difficulty drop enough for 'honest' miners to keep mining to secure the network in this case i assume places like kazakhstan ha ry cheap energy that would allow honest miners there to continue to mine well after places like the us ha turned off their miners how would this realistically play out ,possibility of 'bad actors' mining btc at a loss,1.0,1,z57dlb,twinchell,0,2022-11-26 13:18:40,1669468734,1669818133,2022-11-26,13:18:40

bitcoin,hey y'all long time lurker around these and other crypto related parts of reddit i figured this would be the best community to ask an honest question i ha regarding self custody and its idealized future with the recent collapse of ftx the greater crypto community has been beating the drum of returning to the fundamentals and the importance of not your keys not your crypto i was listening to an interview on the breakdown with jesse powell of kraken this ening and he seemed to imply that the idea of keeping cash in a shoebox under your bed was some sort of perfect model for how people kept money in the past he was drawing the comparison to keeping cash under your bed in a shoebox in the old days and it felt like he was romanticizing it the implication is that keeping your crypto in cold storage on a hardware wallet is what eryone should be doing i do this i' e this since i understood the importance of it when i first got into crypto in early i know i'm a baby i wasn't affected at all by the collapse of ftx en though i'd purchased from them in the past self custody makes sense to me it's certainly one of the values i identify with and understand as important to the space simply put we 't want some centralized organizations able to freeze our assets control how we spend our money or in anyway affect our decisions surrounding it with all that being said here's my question if the idealized future of self custody is realized how does that look for the normal person and will it er include the same conniences assurances that large centralized banks offer the idea of keeping cash under my bed is frankly ridiculous there's so many things that can go wrong my house could be broken into and my shoebox taken i could lose the shoebox the shoebox could be taken by a family member if i er want to spend that money i ha to go home and physically get the cash to spend it somewhere the list goes on virtually all the same problems exist today with cryptocurrency but to some degree they're en worse want to spend some of my crypto i'd better ha my physical hardware wallet on me or i'd at least better ha transferred some of it to a location that i can access it from the internet what happens if my house burns down maybe i stored my seed phrase in another location but that's kind of a lot to ask isn't it what happens if my hardware wallet malfunctions what happens if the company that owns the hardware wallet pushes a bad firmware software update sure i can always restore that wallet with my seed phrase but holy shit what a painful process not to mention the learning cur on all of it is certainly non trivial i'm a software engineer a lot of the interactions intuitily makes some sense to me i won't get too much into how the expectation of asking some non technical year old person is fairly ridiculous i imagine a lot of that will be ironed out or the years as we find a more seamless way to set wallets up and interact with them i want my question to focus around is there a world where self custody is er as connient as trusting some centralized agency with a massi infrastructure and the motivation for people to spend money is connience and to a certain degree security fraud protection insurance etc simply a trade off of having direct control or your money or does crypto ha some long term solution for that i'm just too close minded to imagine will i always ha to carry my hardware wallet around with me just curious to hear from others thanks ,a question around the future of self custody,1.0,1,z3b6ek,pgowdy13,0,2022-11-24 05:18:48,1669267138,1669818724,2022-11-24,05:18:48

bitcoin,hi all apologies for the long post but i'm just doing some thought experiments and this was one of them i 't ha enough knowledge about the mining side of btc to go through with this but my question is pretty much the title and i'd like to see what others think and hopefully some reasonings on why this isn't an issue below are some assumptions behind the reasoning of this thought i understand the chances are incredibly low for all of these things happening but i'm still curious to know and i think it would be a good discussion i'm also aware of the difficulty adjustment per point but bear with me so i'm assuming btc price stays low suppressed miners get priced out due to unprofitability a lot and i mean a lot of miners stop mining within a short time horizon to prent further losses i e multiple large mining pools stop mining so much so that there are far too many blocks until the next difficulty adjustment now there are a fraction of the miners left on the network tasked with solving blocks but the hash rate has been reduced heavily resulting in a disproportioned difficulty lel to hash rate blocks are then sold incredibly slowly and require a heavy amount of energy input and cost to sol still resulting in a potential loss en if we assume miners would recei a higher subsidy said another way i'm assuming that although less miners would be entitled to more of the block rewards aka would make it more profitable for them this increase in rewards is offset by the large increase in cost to sol the block removing any additional profitability and keeping them in a loss positionthis then leads me to a few question what the title is asking is the mining difficulty adjustment calculation weighted more towards the near term and would it help sol this issue after slowly solving the remaining blocks well abo the desired arage minute blocktime i'd appreciate any good resources on learning about the difficulty adjustment can something like this be mitigated is it crucially important for the arage block to be sold ery minutes what happens if me one block per hour or worse than that i would think this is important as it helps preser the security of the network and to keep the costs to attack the network high via double spending or making a longer manipulated chainthat's the extent of my thoughts and questions i'm no expert probably clear to some of you haha but wanted to ask anyway thanks ,can bitcoin fail or face a lot of difficulty if mining difficulty gets too high and miners get priced out due to unprofitability or some other cause ,1.0,1,z29jlz,sigsysigs,0,2022-11-23 00:01:09,1669161685,1669819074,2022-11-23,00:01:09

bitcoin,as online merchants experiment with crypto and start accepting crypto payments they are often intrigued by the idea of accepting multiple cryptocurrencies but as time goes by most of them often realize that there is really no real benefit of doing so and the best crypto to accept is bitcoin it is the only crypto that has the most user base and the only one that is still standing today and will in the future en many crypto payment gateways for some reason also think it's lucrati to offer crypto options for their users but it's actually disadvantageous for online merchants who start accepting shitcoins on their webstores only to see their value drop or go to zero suddenly in the long run the safest bet is bitcoin whener people ask me what's the best route to start accepting crypto my advice is always to start with bitcoin and take it from there and use gateways that are noncustodial and 't ask for kyc if privacy is a concern there are many payment gateways that make it simple for online merchants to start accepting bitcoin on their online stores and 't ask for id docs such as blockonomics gourl and btcpay serr starting simple is always the best way and experimenting with too many altcoins especially without prior knowledge is risky ,with time most online merchants are realizing the benefits of accepting bitcoin in their online stores and dumping other altcoins ,1.0,1,z1t910,primalfabric,0,2022-11-22 13:11:46,1669122723,1669819249,2022-11-22,13:11:46

bitcoin,this is from the book market wizards jim rogers one of the best instors of all time is interviewed the basic problem in the world today is that america is consuming more than it is saving you need to do erything you can to encourage saving and instment eliminate taxation of savings the capital gains tax and dual taxation of dividends bring back the more attracti incentis for iras keoghs and ks at the same time you need to do erything you can to discourage consumption change our tax structure to utilize a value added tax which taxes consumption rather than saving and insting cut gornment spending dramatically and there are lots of ways of doing it without hurting the economy too badly we would ha problems but the problems would not be nearly as bad as when they are forced on us if we 't bite the bullet then we are going to ha a s type collapse with the present cast of jerks in washington it is not going to happen the politicians are going to foul things up they are not going to do what has to be e they are going to be more concerned about keeping their votes and winning the next election that is going to continue until we are forced into solving our problems then it is going to be a disaster initially the politicians will say we' got to bite the bullet and suffer through this this is good for us it will help clean out our system people are going to buy that for a while then it is going to start to hurt then it is really going to start to hurt at that point the politicians are going to gi up and they are going to start to inflate their way out of it but the only way to inflate your way out at that point is to really print money the dollar could entually become like the argentine peso remember the civil war expression i 't gi a damn about a greenback dollar ,our leaders should encourage saving not consuming ,1.0,1,z1qnmv,mektzer,0,2022-11-22 10:56:34,1669114607,1669819275,2022-11-22,10:56:34

bitcoin,you may not see it now but sbf actually showed eryone what ftx was setup to do those invold felt ok doing it right out in the open use it's hard to imagine anyone would suspect what i am about to tell you if ftx was still operating to this day ftx was setup from the beginning as a dark money political slush fund this scheme always had an exit strategy but it was supposed to be years if not decades down the road before they would need to exit they knew there was always a chance someone would start to figure out what was going on but no one suspected this they were going to use ftx to fund erything they could to permanently take control of the us gornment or the next years think of the midterms as a trial run of this setup at sbf funneled million into the midterms making him the second largest democrat ator behind george soros it's ry likely that m was ftxs customer funds or laundered money but it s safe to say at the ry least it was not sbfs money the reason it seems like eryone is caught with pants down hoping if they hold still no one will notice is use they honestly t know what to do they are exposed so badly that for now the safest thing to do is nothing sam knew from the beginning it was all fake and no matter how much success or fame he gained from ftx that his fate would ultimately end with the ents we saw the other day i can only speculate on this part but i think as time went on he really belied that if it weren t for those who orchestrated erything that he would be a successful ceo of an exchange like ftx or time he started to belie his actions were why ftx was at the top of the world and he resented the fact he would ner get credit for it resentment grew and he accelerated the process by taking actions he wasn t supposed to which led to the end of ftx to be clear i am saying the democrats and other powerful political entities set up ftx with the intention of using it to fund whater they needed to expand their reach and stay in power they were going to continue operating as long as possible and they had a plan b that they saw as a win win the exit strategy all along was to blow up ftx in such a fashion that the sec would ha what it needed to force regulation of the crypto space it would also help cor their tracks of their political operations the large media companies were also invold in running cor for this operation i m not sure how much they knew about what was really going on but i suspect they didn t know much they ha operated essentially as a wing of the democrat party for years now and are likely comfortable doing this sort of thing without knowing why this is likely why they weren t worried about orselling smb and ftx to an absurd degree they likely wouldn t ha been so obvious about it if they known what they were invold in coring up gt please note that some of the packaging includes parts small enough to be a choking hazard to anybody under the age of the first step in the assembly process is setting the cartridge labelled 'izyalikeit' to at least a value of centi marks ,i'm from the future here's what ftx actually was and what happened ,1.0,1,z1q359,osxwho,0,2022-11-22 10:21:02,1669112480,1669819280,2022-11-22,10:21:02

bitcoin,for a hyperbitcoinized future to be viable eryone needs to be able to use lightning for the vast majority of their transactions and the chain for massi purchases if on chain is a vault and lightning is the wallet you walk around with easy transition between the two modes without sacrificing the interconnected nature of the ln is critical the loop feature that lightning labs has deloped needs to be standardized and widely available to all or at least a variant of it i suspect that this vision of the future would ha the bulk of on chain activity being loop processing one idea that i' been kicking around that i would like some feedback on is for lightning nodes to be able to both cooperatily close and open a lightning channel in a single transaction the two parties would essentially be refreshing the channel but more importantly one or both of them could ha additional inputs to increase the size of the channel or additional outputs for moving off the channel this same functionality could allow a service provider that manages multiple nodes with well connected channels to ha an arbitrary number of single signer inputs sign funds into the refreshed channel and then routed back to them a loop in and multiple outputs that come from lightning payments to be sent back out a loop out the orall size of the channel then would ha a net change of the amount looped in vs out this should be possible to code without changing anything on chain merely an addition or change to the bolt specification to allow for this kind of refresh thoughts ,loop needs to be a standard on the lightning network,1.0,1,z1aecv,seeker0003,0,2022-11-21 21:11:52,1669065123,1669819435,2022-11-21,21:11:52

bitcoin,first of all i belie in the future of bitcoin and dca weekly as an instment hower there seems to be huge weaknesses that i'd like to learn more about from this community to satisfy my naite storage it's complicated 't hold your coins in an exchange not your keys not your coins etc if the goal is world adoption then i feel like the barrier of entry is pretty high for people to safely store coins they ha to buy on a trusted exchange then transfer them to a hardware wallet where they are difficult to spend when the user is ready to many this process is confusing and expensi is there something i'm missing here loss of coins there will only er be million coins hower any user that is safely storing off an exchange risks total loss if they forget lose their keys that is a huge risk sure less coins in circulation may increase the value of those that remain but on a long enough timescale all could be potentially lost i suppose hiding cash in your mattress until your house burns down is a comparable exle but that seems far less likely than losing your keys ,please address my perceid weaknesses of bitcoin,1.0,1,z18v31,psychedelic_dolphin,0,2022-11-21 20:11:36,1669061514,1669819449,2022-11-21,20:11:36

bitcoin,hi bitcoiners i just wanted to shine light on the grayscale situation i' been following barry around on the internet for around two years now and would just like to say i think eryone is wrong about him barry is not your usual hedge fund manager that lasts half a cycle and then goes bust he tweets in a ry troll cryptic manor if you check back to his tweets where he says things like it's going to be a big week what he actually means is it's going to be a big wick to the downside if you followed barry you would ha made so much money shorting the bear market his signals were amazing and knew exactly when to get in and out of positions and would tweet about them in a troll way before it happened twitter is scared of the current situation of grayscale and worried gs will end up liquidating positions and sending btc to k again i 't belie this is the case as he knew where the market was going in the first place all barry did was sell a product to a bunch of low iq degen hedge funds ac who went bust that's not his problem i'm also of the essence that he has a huge short position under the radar here is a tweet from back in may which is actually a genuine tweet of him giving great advice i think there is a huge misunderstanding here about grayscale and barry i personally 't expect a person of this calibre to go bust in my humble opinion i think he is trolling eryone here are a few troll tweets from himself just do the opposite tweet tweet tweet calls the top ,my view on barry silbert and the grayscale situation,1.0,1,z15a80,monovon,0,2022-11-21 17:54:36,1669053288,1669819493,2022-11-21,17:54:36

bitcoin, disclaimer i'm not an economist so my pov or math might be flawed it baffles me that we rely on a fiat based market cap for bitcoin's value aren't we supposed to be moving away from the fiat system with the help of crypto blockchain tech the lightning network helped speed up the currency adoption but it's still reliant on fiat valuation which not only suffers from extreme volatility scaring away merchants providers to accept btc for payment but in my opinion it's not the best way to think about how to use the bitcoin protocol we should consider how to utilize the bitcoin code's protocol to properly trade goods and services with the network's value measured by the gdp provided by its users without any reliance on fiat market cap hear me out the u s abaned the gold standard in so fiat isn't backed by anything it's merely digits on a screen so the volatility in trade markets is irrelevant since btc should be backed by the bitcoin network's gdp not fiat a suggested fiat to btc anti volatility conrsion rate btc has a m max supply b global population by the year last mined btc btc per person for equal allocation of btc k satoshis excluding lost irretrievable coins now the question is how do we value price and trade with btc per person exle btc k median annual income in usa in btc this would make market rates for goods services as gt btc btc btc k btc k btc k btc m btc m btc m btcdoes this conrsion rate orall idea make sense if so why aren't we putting thought and energy into perfecting this type of utilization with bitcoin or if this idea is not applicable why not looking forward to any input on this thanks for your time ,why do we value btc with fiat vs the gdp of its users ,1.0,1,yxwno2,airicmusic,0,2022-11-17 17:51:40,1668707513,1669820664,2022-11-17,17:51:40

bitcoin,bitcoin is true ownership and represents the only way humans can secure wealth without violence one of the most difficult concepts for people to understand is that other than knowledge you do not own anything in the legacy financial system seeking fiat wealth is completely pointless and just reinforces the current violence based system real estate is taxed and can be confiscated values can be manipulated by gornments and speculators if war breaks out where you li you can't take it with you same goes for durable goods and precious metals but i ha a k stocks bonds savings aren't real unless you direct register aka self custody your stock shares you own an iou en then your accounts can be frozen on a whim of a tyrannical gornment or taxed into oblivion fiat savings are designed to lose value or time due to inflation and money printing this whole system is built on lies and the house always wins altcoins are just get rich quick schemes by those looking to fool people who are late r to the bitcoin party and ha regrets hint there can be an infinite number of altcoins but there will only er be one bitcoin the list goes on bitcoin on the other hand when properly self custodied not on exchanges is yours it cannot be censored or confiscated again if properly self custodied you can take it with you anywhere in the world when your gornment fails you it is the first asset again other than knowledge that you can truly own it represents such a radically different way of thinking that it will take many many years for people to fully understand its implications until then the corrupt legacy financial system will do erything to try and stop it altcoins futures negati media regulations taxes etc will all continue to be deployed against it the good news is that none of it will work no one can make more bitcoin no one can take yours away all they can control is the fiat price humanity wins when price stops being the end point we collectily seek wake up from the fiat nightmare stop caring about price bitcoin is so much better for us all ,price doesn't matter bitcoin offering true ownership does ,1.0,1,yxoek4,apprehensive-log-849,0,2022-11-17 11:58:41,1668686332,1669820752,2022-11-17,11:58:41

bitcoin,please can someone shed some light onto these two concepts private key is the actual access to the control of the address the seed phrase is able to conrt the words into the private key to restore lost access what i 't understand is that the seed phrase can restore access to multiple addresses at once correct one seed phrase from one software wallet can restore access to a multitude of private keys does that mean that if that software wallet provider company goes bankrupt and the app disappears there is no way to use that seed phrase and restore access to the say coins i had in associated with that seed phrase in that wallet can i just use that seed phrase in another companies wallet and it would restore my coins there what if that wallet doesn't support half of those coins is that access lost forer or is the process of conrting the seed phrase into multiple private keys a transparent one and can be run independently of a software wallet and i can just get an output of all the priat keys outside of a wallet and use them independently secondly i keep reading that a private key is digits but when i look at private keys they are much less and not just numbers but also letters is this use letters are a short form of writing certain numbers or how come most private keys are only say characters not digits ,seed phrase vs private key,1.0,1,yu1q4v,32owand61,0,2022-11-13 13:30:12,1668346226,1669822103,2022-11-13,13:30:12

bitcoin,ftx and its shit coins debacle was called by mallardshead months ago bitcoin is not crypto bitcoin is the breakthrough crypto tokens alts all that are only possible use bitcoin showed it was possible bitcoin is a network a protocol and a system of digital money that made one of the biggest breakthroughs in history the inntion of digital scarcity it allowed a digital thing to be tied to the real world through quantifiable expenditure of energy pow bitcoin is a public utility that has no owners no rulers no backing of any state or corporation and a conception that can ner again be repeated in history cryptos are projects that tackle use cases raise funding ha employees ceo's board members foundations and can easily be censored by a state of crypto is created to enrich the creators with retail as exit liquidity all of them will trend to zero against bitcoin bitcoin is an alternati to central banking modern monetary policy run by volunteers and can be used by anyone and eryone it does not discriminate it is a public good like the internet is for moving and storing information the bitcoin network is for moving and storing value crypto is not much different from fintech companies except they use a slow and expensi database and print their own treasuries at the push of a button sure there might be some interesting use cases but literally all of them can be e without a blockchain understanding that bitcoin is not crypto is just the first step the deeper you go into that rabbit hole the more questions you ask the more you put bitcoin under a microscope the more mind blowing it becomes bitcoin is not crypto i see bitcoin the internet remote work and proliferation of english the language composing to distribute away the power centers of nation states banks and corporations not sometime in the distant future either rather around the end of this decade we'll see the eu alliance break dao's form in smaller african nations and palestine's imports match their exports it will become a real challenge for gornment's to levy taxes i think we're starting to see this begin already that means en more aggressi money printing and the militarization of tax agencies it won't work though gornments will ha to incentivize their own citizens to pay taxes and this will require projects of immense value with transparent accounting the prestige politicians ha enjoyed for so long will fade as their powers get distributed to the people and real solutions without symbolic affectation are required to gorn when the lightning network is ready nodes liquidity and user growth is currently parabolic maybe by bitcoin will enter its transaction phase whole coins won't be so much a thing as satoshis or sats the law of diminishing returns will ha arrid gone will be the days of x gains and large volatility the gains will become smaller and slower i expect this to begin at sats which would correlate to a m bitcoin which would gi the network the entire market cap of gold currently t still small and we'll still see large gains until m but they'll be smaller and the dollar peg will fade a robust defi ecosystem will also be built on and around bitcoin that means smart contracts the taproot upgrade will kick this off in earnest which will only augment network effects and utility bitcoin adoption is growing at a faster global pace than the internet did in the s one reason for this is use the infrastructure is already built when open source satellites blanket the world allowing a transaction in patagonia or the arctic as easily as nyc gornment's can do what elon musk suggested they do when he was asked about regulation of starlink or afghanistan they can shake their fist at the sky i posit bitcoin will be man's final money just as artificial intelligence ai will be man's final inntion this is mostly due to the way bitcoin lerages energy as henry ford and thomas edison crudely figured out years ago in what most fail to realize is that the only physical currency in the world is energy see energy is required to ha a standing military to start a small business for nation states to exist for transportation globalization and maybe most importantly to communicate bitcoin then uses energy to guarantee an individual's property btc and secure its network this is much different than the approach pos consensus blockchains take their gornance is a conrsation eryone wants to side step and pivot towards the other two parts of the blockchain trilemma they' sold money has nothing to do with tps throughput or tx cost those are all features of a blockchain many of us grew up under democracy and assume its angelic ideals are best applied erywhere well they're not especially on blockchains aspiring for global adoption the first problem is there's no way to know how many people own how many tokens which makes the allocation of voting power impossible and unfair another problem is there's no way to curtail collusion another is that of the world's population lis in two countries china india and that percentage is only growing another is that voting is a skill and after something is voted on and passed token holders against the change s ha no ability to opt out we won't en bother going into the tokenomics many of these projects boast bitcoin does away with this nonsense by guaranteeing immutable rights having fixed issuance and tethering itself to the physical world by leraging physical infrastructure none more important than energy whether you ha bitcoin or satoshis doesn't matter there's nothing one can do that the other cannot there's no voting no securing the network with staking no special privileges no collusion and on the consensus layer if a proposal is agreed upon by of the hash it's optional wether a miner wants to implement it or not meaning they can opt out bitcoin's first attraction is greed but below it quietly disburses freedom and distributes away the center of power structures bitcoin pollutes the environment from an economy of scale cheap electricity access to capital but below it quietly incentivizes green energy making it competiti regardless of fossil fuel affordability the end result of this trojan horse is going to be fascinating to watch and how fast it degrades nation states or finances sci fi alternati energy projects might surprise some my judgement a warning and if you 't mind a tinfoil hat all of this doesn't happen without manifesting ry real problems during its transition phase but whater you're doing in life currently it should be geared towards acquiring more bitcoin i'd en suggest temporarily taking on a second job for the task now for the tinfoil hat as friction technical difficulty of wallets and hard wallets collapses privacy and ui improments will skyrocket this means the first thing to break will be world gornment's ability to levy taxes effectily which will require an enormous increase in money printing and the militarization of their tax collection agencies the second shoe to drop will be mass municipal bankruptcies as cities are already crushed under the weight of pension debt which they carry in hopes of getting federal bailouts use this debt is unserviceable and staring down the barrel of compound interest with pensions gone fireman police your water teachers parks and recreation will become unstable climate change how will cities finance the infrastructure needed to combat worsening droughts fires and flooding much of the entire state of florida for exle flattest us state has serious flooding issues nobody wants to talk about the entire lower half of the state's coastline needs projects totaling or t to combat sea lel rise effectily this will all lead to migration and people on the mo those global

bitcoin,okay so a little backstory i'm new to cold storage and still trying to familiarize myself with all the details i' used exchanges so far robinhood voyager ftx feels like i' managed to make ery mistake possible but still lucky enough not to ha lost anything to the exchanges earlier today i finally got around to moving my bitcoin from ftx to my ledger i went through the whole process of setting up the ledger and whatnot for the first time it was easier than i thought it would be and i'm glad erything is in cold storage and not on the exchanges anymore i'm feeling pretty relied right now going forward i plan on buying with strike and sending to my ledger i did a test and sent a small amount of bitcoin from strike to ledger about cents worth of bitcoin but then in ledger li the transaction shows there was a fee of about so i'm confused what exactly the fee is i thought with strike there would be no fee i'm assuming the fee is a mining gas fee not really sure if those are the right terms i thought that was avoided use strike uses the lightning network or is it a fee that ledger li is charging me is there a way to avoid or reduce this fee when i send bitcoin from strike to ledger and then in the future if i wanted to mo bitcoin from the ledger back to strike is there going to be another similar fee and can it be avoided right now i just use bitcoin as an instment store of value i 't plan on selling for the foreseeable future in the future if i want to start using it for daily purchases say something small like a drink at the gas station how would you recommend going about that say i get something like the strike card i 't think it's released yet but this is a hypothetical so i use my strike card to pay for a c can of arizona tea is strike going to pass along a gas mining fee to the gas station use i bought the tea anyway i'm trying to get a better understanding of how it all works when it comes to fees hopefully this all makes sense any info you ha that can clear things up for me would be great thanks ,questions about using strike with a ledger nano s and fees ,1.0,1,ypuoe7,neon_meat_dreams,0,2022-11-08 18:38:48,1667932742,1669823612,2022-11-08,18:38:48

bitcoin,when people say we're early or we're late on the subject of cryptocurrencies specifically bitcoin there are two main topics i like to look at first it's the adoption rate and second what should happen to increase that adoption rate if there are no viable ways to increase the adoption rate we are behind schedule if they exist we're early and one of the most talked about topics on this subject is cbdc central bank digital currency in my opinion the reason why cryptocurrencies ha not yet been massily adopted is use many people just 't care about the factors of autonomy freedom and feel perfectly comfortable with the central bank and the gornment managing their financial life hower it is inevitable that cbdc will bring limitations in these aspects that these same people ha ner cared about before and can slowly begin to understand the importance of financial autonomy cbdc is not being created aimlessly be sure of that my logic follows a similar pattern to successful products in the tech industry to be successful you need to sell a product that sols problems that people didn't know they had and cbdc can make people realize that these problems do exist and look for alternatis that they ner cared before anyway this is just my opinion feel free to disagree ,unpopular but optimistic opinion cbdc will only strengthen cryptocurrencies ,1.0,1,ypsrll,rafaelswi,0,2022-11-08 17:26:44,1667928415,1669823633,2022-11-08,17:26:44

bitcoin,i' been following what has been happening in the world and it seems that inequality is getting to a point where there's bound to be a revolution at some point that's just the general feeling i ha i understand that fiat money has made this inequality worse use of credit expansion and asset bubble that follows it i 't want to get all political but i' been following the situation in uk where the new pm is a guy with m net worth let that sink in to my knowledge the policies he is proposing is mostly benefiting the rich small tax cuts for regular people bigger ones for the wealthy i see this same thing happening erywhere where the game which is being played is sort of class warfare against the working people the kind of thing chomsky is raving about i think that once the majority of the population realizes that they' been screwed by the policies and lobbying read corruption there will be calls reforms while i like bitcoin for the idea that it's censorship free and permissionless i also see it as a problem in terms of inequality wealthy people ha the cash flow to scoop up bitcoin and slowly escape to a realm where you can not re distribute the wealth enly amongst people it really does worry me i know the situation right now is bad but it doesn't mean that re distributing wealth amongst people would be impossible i might be in the minority here with these statements and owning btc would mean that i would also benefit from this realm shift but i 't feel as it is morally the correct thing to do anyway take this as you will and would lo to get some feedback on my thoughts here are some of the links if you're interested in the uk situation s a guy from uk that's explaining the situation in layman's terms,is bitcoin an escape hatch for the ,1.0,1,ymfttn,litecoin-ceo,0,2022-11-05 00:58:03,1667609898,1669824834,2022-11-05,00:58:03

bitcoin,i'm at the point where i'm getting a bit more comfortable with self custody cold storage where i'm ready to mo forward with multi sig i see in sparrow where i can create a new wallet but this makes it seem like the private key is then on my computer i'll explain more why i may be missing a key piece of understanding below i also see where i can add the signing devices and the scheme of of etc and saw a video on using psbt exports and imports where those devices become the multi signatures required to mo is there a way to confirm the address shown in sparrow is a multi sig using my umbrel node via mempool in the umbrel this would help reassure me that en if the private key from sparrow is on the pc and backed up that it's not a normal hot wallet since it requires mutli sig to mo is it more like ledger li where sparrow has the wallet but the private keys are on the devices themsels and not on the pc if so do i just set up those other devices like i would if they were regular cold storage of devices with addresses and words backed up as normally e then later essentially link them together in sparrow as of for exle i also see multi sig detail export from sparrow in a few different formats so you can properly reconstruct the multi sig setup if your computer were wiped crashed using words you can backup with steel metal but is there a preferred way to back this multi sig info is that safe for something like cloud storage and an sd card in a safe or something like that to prent a fire taking out your computer and the backup i'm assuming it's alright to back this multi sig file up in multiple less secure places as it's not the actual private keys or gin it's multi sig in sparrow when you create this new address and set it up as a multi sig going back to the standalone word backups for signing devices how would i backup this sparrow address or is there no real backup since it creates no private key and those keys instead reside on the signing devices and they're backed up as you normally would backup a wallet there since you'd ha an address then on each signing device what happens if you send btc to those addresses instead of the sparrow address does it just beha like different addresses where one of the requires multi sig i think i'm somewhat close to understanding this but really would like to get a better grasp of what's happening under the hood so to speak and want to make sure the backup process is sound as well as my understanding of the flowchart of how this works i' tried to find videos but not sure they quite go into the nuances i'm trying to learn or figure out in this perhaps i'm more fundamentally missing something and a piece of information missing would make it click for me thanks for any help trying to clarify some of these gaps in understanding for me and sorry if some of this seems basic but want to understand it a little more before setting it up will still test with small amounts first 't ha many offline i associate with that could assist with this sort of nuanced topic and aren't any meetups in the area unfortunately any help for a fellow pleb trying to secure their setup and learn more how this works under the hood would be appreciated ,multi sig question help,1.0,1,ymcvu8,snoo_32766,0,2022-11-04 22:48:00,1667602091,1669824869,2022-11-04,22:48:00

bitcoin,and the newly introduced satoshi symbol of combining an s and the symbol by bitko yinowsky their symbols were recently shared in a tweet by bitcoin new daily in the following post before i post my idea i'd like to highlight some key factors that affect how powerful a symbol is monetarily and culturally speaking a strong symbol speaks to the meaning of what it represents often in multiple different ways must be distinguishable en if the differences between it and others are subtle ideally especially for a currency symbol it needs to be easily replicable written expressed less is often more k i s s keep it simple stupid of the two ideas put forward by sat symbol and bitko yinowsky i must say i prefer the former as it perfectly marries together the ideas that while satoshis are bountiful abundant plentiful the total number of bitcoin is inexorably approaching the limit unicode character u s having said this a currency symbol imo deris its practicality from how easily quickly it is written i am concerned that nocoiners will find it alien or simply too much effort to write out i know its pedantic but a consideration nonetheless which is why i appreciate bitko yinowsky's symbol as it's already ry familiar looking and legible hower people ha pointed out that the symbol is not expressed consistently in other countries who's cultures may apply different pronunciations attribute different meanings to the symbol which presupposes that the symbol only really clicks with english nati speakers as i said i took inspiration from both ideas as they both ha merit so here's my albeit crude symbol submission satoshi bitcoin's symbol is the capital letter b not to say the satoshi symbol must be comprised of the letter s but it certainly maintains continuity the legible flow of the letter s is in keeping with the stacking sats mantra dca dca dca the diagonal through the middle of the s is similar to the sat symbol 丰 and connects the s together reminiscent of the infinity symbol under hyperbitcoinization erything will be priced in terms of bitcoin m ery minutes billions of satoshis ebb and flow across the network like an infinity stream besides infinity the diagonal also makes the s look like the number as most bitcoiners know satoshis are fractions of a bitcoin expressed to eight decimal places one bitcoin is btc or satoshis the symbol provides a mental anchor point subconsciously reminding users how many decimal places satoshis are expressed in terms of whole bitcoins for countries that use dollars and cents the latter cents comes from the latin centum meaning hundred one dollar is made up of cents with dollars and cents fully expressed to two decimal places e g to nocoiners this symbol is reminiscent to the dollar symbol english speaker or esl english as second language the dollar is entrenched in our collecti international psyche although hower similar it is i hope you agree that it is distinct enough had i had full access to adobe illustrator as i do normally i could' rendered a much higher quality rsion hower for the purposes of sharing the initial idea paint sufficed i hope to encourage critical discussions creati thinking and abo all the idea that nothing is determined for us already we are all clearly so early in the orall bitcoin adoption cycle bitcoin as a protocol is open source and is strong use of it i'd like to think all aspects of bitcoin can remain open and accepting to thoughtful discourse as who knows what new uses bitcoin will address beyond its use as a sov uoa and it's ability to transfer wealth across time and space cheers ,sat symbol idea,1.0,1,ym0oq5,maintenancegold6992,0,2022-11-04 14:35:58,1667572572,1669825003,2022-11-04,14:35:58

bitcoin,if institutions adopt btc as a store of value and it's stolen from them by hackers and they can't get it back then they could collapse if these institutions go begging to gornment for a bail out on the basis that they're ' too big to fail ' and gornment simply gis them tax payer money like they did in this is like hackers stealing money from ery taxpayer consequently it's unlikely that institutions will er adopt btc as a treasury asset use the insurance costs would be prohibiti hower there's another risk here which is being orlooked let's say for a minute that proof of work is designed to allow recory orders of stolen bitcoin such that institutions can get it back if it's stolen then they could use it as a treasury asset but the value of btc would most likely precipitously drop if it's demonstrated that recory orders can work so institutions could still be in the position of going to gornment for a bailout if they adopt it before a recory order has been demonstrated in other words it's a bad idea for institutions to adopt btc as a treasury asset either with or without recory orders being possible on the network ,the problem with the 'too big to fail' argument,1.0,1,ylxryj,short-survey7013,0,2022-11-04 12:30:47,1667565063,1669825031,2022-11-04,12:30:47

bitcoin, bitcoin does not ha any utility bitcoin is money and money does not ha many uses other than being money it's a worthless paper without any other utility or an entry in a database that being said money is one of the most important inntions we er made and modern civilization could not exist without it money is only useful for financial uses that means it is either a medium of exchange a store of value of an unit of account it's boring but ry important money is a gt trillion market and bitcoin can fill some niches within this market and capture a smaller or bigger percentage of it whether people use it as digital modern rsion of gold as a decentralized saving account remittances as an alternati to banking where banking is not available protect themsels against hyperinflation of their local currencies or against corrupt regimes or just add it to their instment portfolio to dirsify all of these are legitimate uses of bitcoin for which there will always be a certain demand bitcoin is a zero sum game therefore it can't be an instment a lot of things people inst in are zero sum instments gold art wines currencies commodities derivatis options futures are all exles of zero sum instments some of which ha existed for hundreds or thousands of years bitcoin does not ha an intrinsic value therefore the market value is zero a lot of things that people inst in 't ha an intrinsic value gold art collectibles and fiat currencies 't ha any intrinsic value and yet they ha a constant value abo zero bitcoin consumes as much energy as an entire country this argument is often used by journalists trying to manipulate their readers why use country but not compare them to the energy consumption of other things video gaming and tumble dryers consume as much energy as bitcoin but no one perceis them as energy wasting country is used use people percei countries as huge but they percei gaming or dryers as small and insignificant sources of energy consumption in reality bitcoin uses only of global energy worldwide a fairly insignificant number cattle farming is estimated to generate of global greenhouse emissions x more than bitcoin and yet some people seem to be feel far more threatened by bitcoiners instead of meat eaters bitcoin can't scale this does also imply that use bitcoin can't scale now it ner will the truth is that while the base layer has a limited tps capacity bitcoin doesn't need to perform all it's transactions on the first layer so claiming that bitcoin as a technology can ner scale would also assume that no building on second layers will er happen which is of course contradicted by the fact that efforts are being made build on second layers as demand for transactions go up there is an incenti to build more capacity on other layers of the network bitcoin is too volatile this does also imply use bitcoin is volatile now it will always be that volatile there is no reason to belie volatility in bitcoin is constant volatility is a reflection of market maturity bitcoin was far more volatile than bitcoin and that trend to lower volatility will continue recently bitcoin was less volatile than the dow jones or nasdaq ,common bitcoin fallacies,1.0,1,ylvf3h,bitcorner22,0,2022-11-04 10:44:59,1667558711,1669825057,2022-11-04,10:44:59

bitcoin,i ha been a bitcoiner for a few years now i am currently in an advanced keynesian macroeconomics class and it has made me question some things if there is a bitcoin monetary standard in the future how will businesses get credit loans to operate their business without credit businesses would innovate much much slower productivity would go way down less employees they can hire etc it would be much harder to get a business off the ground and take so much longer to build up a business than if you had cheap credit i understand the consequences of cheap credit hence there must be bitcoin banks or exchanges that distribute value between sars and borrowers since bitcoin is decentralized and no protection from a central bank i can imagine there would be bank runs all the time the loans to borrowers would be ry illiquid and the liabilities of sars who deposited their bitcoin would be ry liquid this is what happened during the great depression hypothetically all the bitcoin depositors would pull out of the exchange and the exchange would become insolnt therefore lending credit would be pretty much non existent in a bitcoin standard therefore output and productivity would greatly go down therefore standard of living goes down can someone please walk me through this and pro me wrong the keynesians are getting to me ,problems with a bitcoin monetary standard,1.0,1,yldllh,puzzleheaded_yam7132,0,2022-11-03 20:18:46,1667506741,1669825239,2022-11-03,20:18:46

ethereum,i think that en though the future of the economy remains uncertain that shouldn't scare off artists from experimenting and branching out it's exactly this type of approach that will make an artist more likely to succeed in unstable times not less i looked for the numbers and statistics which are not that great the brookings institution estimated that the creati industry was on track to suffer a loss in sales of or billion in the united states alone with the performing and fine arts sectors being hit the hardest many more began to explore in earnest the opportunities waiting for them in the online space web publishing and streaming as well as emerging technologies such as nfts and the metarse provided ways for artists to expand their reach and experiment with new forms i had that feeling that it en seemed like some artists were ready to turn their back on the real world altogether and embrace nfts as their new future what do you think the near future could look like for artists and other creatis i think that nfts will still likely be a focal point just take a look at projects such as reelstar not only do nfts help artists dirsify their sales channels and reach a much broader more tech savvy audience but the blockchain technology undergirding nfts also makes it extremely easy for artists to track resales and collect royalties automatically i en think that more artists will explore the metarse for artists who want to make their future a little more stable insting in a dirse array of channels and projects could be crucial how big a role will the digital world play as the real world recors what do you think should we rely on digital assets ,how big a role will the digital world play as the real world recors ,1.0,1,10f567v,m_a_l_f_o_y,0,2023-01-18 11:32:04,1674041535,1674041536,2023-01-18,11:32:04

ethereum,as i remember it a few months ago there was an incredible amount of interest and speculation for ethereum's merge to the point that people were proud of supporting the cryptocurrency as if they were behind the idea itself it seemed like yesterday when people said that bitcoin was going to reach the k threshold in it seemed like yesterday when people said that large silicon valley companies such as apple were buying large amounts of bitcoin and thus the price was going up but the truth is that the market is full of these moments where no one can see through the smokescreen of the market moreor it is ry difficult to fight the market and en more impossible to defeat it what i'm getting to is inst your money accordingly but not beyond your means 't sacrifice your necessities for some mirage that might or might not come for after so much speculation from the last bull run to ethereum's merge erything seems to remain the same thus so much speculation so much emotion for little to no change ,the infinite mirage,1.0,1,10edt1z,particularathlete831,0,2023-01-17 14:37:46,1673966280,1673966280,2023-01-17,14:37:46

ethereum,the trilemma has haunts ery single blockchain there is no matter what anyone says there is not a single chain that has yet to sol the trilemma at least for now each chain deals with the trilemma in its own way and ethereum chose to prioritize decentralization and security or scalability now although there technically still is no complete solution for vitalik s trilemma there ha been many improments to both the ethereum chain itself and its helping rollup chains known as ls that wont sol the trilemma but will make it less and less of an issue with time until it entually no longer become a nuance there are mainly two reasons why the trilemma on ethereum will grow irrelevant pretty soon modular ls parallel ls mantle network proto danksharding modular ls current ls while much more efficient than ethereum still ha a hard time dealing with massi spikes in activity use they use a monolithic architecture arbitrum optimism loopring what does this mean this means that these ls while fast still need to take care of execution finality and data availability in a serial manner meaning one after the other modular ls take a different approach they basically split these taks into multiple sub layers and work all of them at the same time in parallel rather than in series currently i know of mantle network as the only l with a modular l testnet online they split tasks into three separate layers layer takes care of execution layer takes care of finality layer takes care of data availability the final layer is perhaps the most important of all as data availability is one of the major issues that ethereum has it battle with it makes the chain extremely clunky and orloads it with data most of which will ner be used proto danksharding i been on this subreddit long enough and ha seen many posts explaining what sharding is so i won t make this post any longer to make it short shadring is an ethereum upgrade that will gi a majoe boost for ls throughput is expected to increase anywhere from to times combination of modular architecture and danksharding modular ls alone are great sharding alone is greatbut the combination of both is something else entirely this will gi ethereum compounded scalability something that it has ner seen before i truly belie that when danksharding get introduced and more ls start leaning towards a modular architecture ethereum will be truly unstoppable and vitalik s trilemma while still technology unsold will become irrelevant ,here s why vitalik s trimella is becoming less and less of an issue for ethereum,1.0,1,10e5rd4,futilelydare899,0,2023-01-17 07:07:51,1673939288,1673939288,2023-01-17,07:07:51

ethereum,about creating special timelocked transactions that can recor funds in the ent that you lose access to your keys these transaction backups work by signing but not sending transactions that deploy a contract or appro an address to spend your erc tokens which recors your funds in the ent that you lose your keys these backups ha a few key advantages they are inherently gasless as the transactions do not need to be broadcast with smart contracts we can add constraints such as timing not valid before or not valid after or modify the recipient address at anytime via a publicly deployed contract the key holder still retains full control of the funds and can invalidate the backups whener they want the data is not particularly sensiti meaning it can be stored online you can safely use your exchange deposit address as the recipient making it easy to regain access to your funds and obviating the need to find a guardian recipient address they are trivial to create and you can make multiple rsions of them for free most blockchains support this concept in one way or another for exle ntimelock in bitcoin see the repo for more info you can checkout the repo here and see an exle backup transaction that i broadcast here what do you think about this concept and how would you impro upon it note that you can already create such transactions for ether and erc tokens by using the code abo ,using special transactions to rescue funds from lost keys my project ,1.0,1,10cbx5s,bitman321,0,2023-01-15 05:44:40,1673761496,1673761496,2023-01-15,05:44:40

ethereum,so the sec has decided to sue both gemini exchange and genesis or the gemini earn program the sec says that gemini was operating an unregistered security by allowing customers to be paid interest on their crypto holdings their crypto would be locked up and lent out to genesis to do whater they please with it gemini exchange apparently made some money from this scheme as well as the customer who would be paid interest genesis owes gemini exchange roughly million bucks my question is will the sec attempt to sue other exchanges possibly coinbase or kraken or binance or paying staking interest on locked up ethereum it s not exactly the same as what the gemini earn program did but i m a little bit worried staked eth secures the network by allowing nodes to be created to appro transactions you get paid to keep the network running someone tell me that i ha nothing to worry about i m glad genesis is finally being forced to do something idk if the sec suing them will result in any help for users with their crypto stuck with genesis and gemini earn seems like gensler just wants crypto users to suffer i really hope eth doesn t get regulated by enforcement with this gemini and genesis bs i feel like staking eth to secure the network is totally different than the gemini and genesis shenanigans ,gemini and genesis sued by the sec or lending program does this mean eth and eth staking rewards are in the crosshairs ,1.0,1,10ak1z1,walla_walla_26,0,2023-01-13 03:36:59,1673581031,1673581032,2023-01-13,03:36:59

ethereum,although i ha high hopes for blockchain gaming there are certain evident problems that might limit widespread adoption and gi the pe nft gaming industry more negati publicity i would add to the list some of these issues most people say that nft games are not fun i was one of them until i started checking out coinfantasy or gods unchained it's true that there ha been a ton of game tokens and releases in the nft space recently and many of them look like garbage with ry questionable gameplay it becomes tough to keep gamers engaged when the gameplay is extremely repetiti and there are less than minutes of it people just stop playing the game when they stop making money orall the majority of current pe games feel more like a job with the worst kind of grind would you agree how about a high entry barrier the majority of casual players simply cannot pay the admission cost it causes two related problems first the game is inaccessible to regular users which hinders long term user growth second instors are typically traders rather than gamers the delopers recei little input when the instors 't actually play the game and the game gradually dies poor tokenomics is probably one of the common issues traders buy nfts and hire gamers scholars to play the game using these nfts scholars make money in the form of nati crypto tokens instors and gamers dump the token on new instors hower once new instors stop to join the game there is no exit liquidity for current instors we all know that traditional gamers hate nfts but i belie that one of the problems is that instors ha unrealistic expectations despite the fact that there are many problems with this sort of gaming in general i belie that we should gi it a try use there are many fantastic games what do you think about all of the problems i' mentioned will they soon be resold that in my opinion is the crucial element that will allow games to advance en further ,what are the main problems pe games need to sol to become mainstream ,1.0,1,109c9sd,turtlepajama,0,2023-01-11 18:41:06,1673462476,1673462477,2023-01-11,18:41:06
ethereum,and from this i understand that a transaction between eoaa and a smart contract can trigger transfers of token from the eoaa that sent the transaction to another eoab but this transfer of token between eoaa to eoab is not recorded on the blockchain my question now is if one is interested in tracking and be alerted by all activities on an account how will one do this for exle if i want to be notified when tokens are transfered to eoab gin the fact that the token transfer from eoaa to eoab does not show up in any transaction how can i be notified based on my knowledge one way could be to listen to transfer ents on smart contracts but follow up questions as far as i understand it is possible for a smart contract to implement the transfer methods without emitting the transfer ent not good practice but nothing stopping this from happening which makes me think this approach of listening to the transfer ent might not be fool proof the transfer method and transfer ents are standardized part of erc token but i can imagine that there are other methods and operations peculiar to certain smart contracts not standardized but that will also lead to token transfer from one eoa to another so that means an approach of listening to just the transfer ent will miss these kinds of token moment so again the question how can one track all ents' especially token and eth transfers in and out of an eoa gin the technical drawbacks i listed below are there some knowledge about the workings of ethereum that i do not know about that could make this possible ,how to track for certain all addresses affected by a transaction ,1.0,1,109816k,finlaydotweber,0,2023-01-11 15:54:16,1673452469,1673452470,2023-01-11,15:54:16

ethereum,here we get queries on this subject all the time so i thought i'd clear the air when you dispose of cryptocurrency to pay for a fee you may trigger a capital gain tax cgt ent on the disposal value of the fee itself depending on your tax jurisdiction of course as a result this capital gain loss is realised on the difference between the acquisition and disposal price of the cryptocurrency before paying for the fee as an exle you purchase eth to use for fees at the price of some time later you decide to mint an nft the gas fees for this mint are paid for in eth and you pay a gas fee of eth at the time of the sale the price of eth is now as a result you' actually made a gain on the eth itself which was used as a gas fee the reason why is use the acquisition value of the eth was and the disposal value of the eth is therefore this will trigger a capital gains ent of for the sale of the eth which was used for gas while this may seem obvious to some you'd be surprised how many people forget to account for this in their capital gains calculations hope that clarifies things and feel free to read more on this here ,crypto taxes are eth gas fees taxable ,1.0,1,106ymuu,miker5659,0,2023-01-08 23:58:28,1673222327,1673222327,2023-01-08,23:58:28

ethereum, the truth about cbdcs ominous design realed a digital prison is being built in the shadows massi orreach of central banks underway they are designing a new kind of money allowing them to establish centralized settlement of all payments tie digital identities to all transactions and record them on a central bank ledger forer force built in features such as limits on how much cbdc you can ha in your account negati interest rates account charges in line with regulatory objectis and caps on conrsions and spending create money that is traceable programmable taxable and subject to the monetary whims of central planners st out spending without permission and slowly phase out cash the war on money continues the aim to replace cash with a system of centralized control or all transactions and account balances this report explains exactly what to expect from central bank digital currencies cbdcs it looks at the possible design options what central banks ha decided so far and the likely outcomes the ugly conclusion is that cbdcs are a new form of currency that allows a small group of unelected people control or what we can and cannot do with our own money lt what is going on a lot has been said and written about cbdcs most was speculation but now evidence emerges of what is being built gin that our financial system is complex one cannot just click a button and introduce a cbdc as of now much work has already been e and much is still to be e this report traces the historical path of the delopment of cbdcs we start with looking at what cbdcs are then we look at why we need them as explained by the bank of international settlements bis next we look at how cbdcs are designed as the central regulator of central banks the bis made an inntory of all the different design options for cbdcs it also provided an honest account of the potential benefits and downsides of those choices with this knowledge we can analyze the design choices made so far we obser how the european central bank ecb is going full steam ahead with their cbdc we come to the shocking discory that the most important design choices ha already been made and that there ha en been companies hired to start programming next we analyze what is happening in the us the us federal reser fed is not as far advanced with their cbdc as the ecb hower their frank report reals that their cbdc design choices result in similar control mechanisms as that of the ecb and it en exposes possible sinister motis to put it bluntly what central banks are choosing for design so far tells us all we need to know about where this is heading authorities are downplaying what is going on and pretending that all is open for debate and subjected to the democratic process but the designs they are secretly pushing forward open the door to the dystopian future we all fear lt what are central bank digital currencies before we can continue we ha to define cbdcs after all we already ha digital money but cbdcs and what we currently use as digital money are ry different things what we currently refer to as digital money is not issued by the central bank in the modern financial system the central bank only creates money in the form of cash bills and coins and cash deposits with banks all other money is created by private banks that s right the digital money currently in use is created by private institutions the digital units in your bank account are issued by a private bank cbdcs on the contrary are digital public money issued by the central bank cbdcs are a totally new kind of money with many new features to summarize we go from two types to three types of retail money cash public money current digital money private money current cbdc public money new source ecb digital euro our future money note that cbdcs are essentially just different forms of the same currency one unit of cash is on par with one unit of cbdc they are interchangeable for reasons explained later these forms of money are also intended to exist alongside each other for the foreseeable future to summarize central banks are issuing a new rsion of money which is a liability of the central bank as such cbdcs are not just another form of digital money as public money they are more comparable to the other form of public money cash this begs the question why do we need an addition replacement for cash lt why do we need cbdcs according to central banks there is much debate on why cbdcs are being rolled out to avoid speculation we will stick with what the bis has said about why we need cbdcs this approach helps us to understand the decisions central banks ha taken and what the logical outcome will be financial stability and the reduced role of public moneyor the past few years cash has become less popular this presents a problem use as shown cash is currently the only form of public money used by the public retail and so when cash is phased out so is public money a principal concern of central banks is that if in the future cash were no longer widely accepted or available a sere financial crisis in the private financial system might create further havoc by disrupting day to day business and retail transactions cbdcs would be a way to keep the economy functioning monetary policyanother benefit of cbdcs touted by the bis is that they allow for a more direct influence on monetary policy arguments for issuing a cbdc include potential strengthening of the pass through of the policy rate to money markets and deposit rates and helping to alleviate the zero or effecti lower bound constraint the bis also argues for direct stimulus let s take a look at each benefit strengthening of the pass through of the policy rate means more control or the interest rates charged throughout the financial system central banks wish to bypass private banks and set rates directly from the moment that households consider a cbdc to be an alternati to commercial bank deposits banks will ha less scope for independently setting the interest rate on deposits of the general public the zero lower bound describes the limit of negati interest rates in short in an environment of increasingly lower interest rates on bank accounts people might pull their money out of the bank it is after all better to hold cash than money in an account that charges deep negati interest rates to address this issue the imf circulated a paper called breaking through the zero lower bound it explores the idea of having different interest rates for different forms of money for exle an additional interest rate on cash can ry easily be charged on private banks through what is known as the cash window at the central bank the central bank charges the regular banks for the use of cash and the banks then charge the users through extra fees on withdrawals and deposits this way the use of cash can be made more expensi than digital forms of money this mechanism can be applied to steer the use of different forms of money and en be a stepping stone on the road to a cashless society as you ll see later the imf s idea of different interest rates for different kinds of money is vigorously embraced by central banks for exle the nigerian central bank used this idea to restrict cash shortly after introducing their unpopular cbdc and finally according to the bis cbdcs could facilitate a more direct distribution of fiscal stimulus to those members of the general public who need it this could make such policies more effecti than general helicopter money or distribution through the indirect and imperfect banking channels which ha been used in the past financial inclusionanother buzzword central banks like to use is financial inclusion with a cbdc eryone could ha access to basic financial services this would be especially interesting for people not serd by the current financial system which is a situation more prevalent outside the deloped world but as always like much else in the dirsity and inclusion agenda these rosy goals are mostly a facade one of the most prominent organisations behind financial inclusion is the united nations for whom the financial inclusion agenda allows the unlocking of public and private resources to fund their sustainable delopment goals the un in turn coordinates its policies through the better than cash alliance an ngo acting as a front for the interests of among others the bill melinda gates foundation citi bank mastercard and visa inc in this light inclusi finance can be seen as the conrsion of the unbanked into tax and debt serfs who pay transaction fees and ser as collateral for the financial system financial innovationthe bis is discussing all sorts of other features all made possible by the idea of programmable money as we will see most of this innovation is in the interests of central banks one of the promised benefits of cbdcs is that it can make international payments much more efficient and transparent use these kinds of liabilities are being built from scratch cbdcs are billed as offering a unique opportunity to facilitate easier cross border payments lt cbdc design choicesbefore we continue it is important to note that there ha been few official decisions made as to how to mo forward the introduction of a cbdc requires significant work and central banks are moving slowly in order not to break anything in this next section we look at the orviews the bis has made on designing cbdcs lots of research has been e across academia financial institutions and the central banks and the bis has created a nice summary of the design options it also reals what the benefits and downsides of these design choices are with this knowledge we can then look at the design decisions that ha already been made by the ecb and fed and hence conclude what is happening behind the scenes tokens vs identity basedfirst of all a choice has to be made as to whether the cbdc is to be token based or tied to an identity through an account according to the bis it has to be either one or the other source bis quarterly review march a token based system would work like other crypto currencies those with the private keys can spend the money but the drawbacks according to the bis are sere one is the high risk of losing funds if end users fail to keep their private key secret furthermore it would be challenging to design an effecti regulatory framework for such a system law enforcement agencies would run into difficulties when seeking to identify claim owners or follow money flows just as with cash or bearer securities in addition a token system would nullify the central bank objectis discussed abo the other option is that the use and ownership of a cbdc is accessible through an account tied to an identity similar to how the current banking system operates to make this happen the bis calls for strong identities for all account holders where each individual is tied to one identifier across the entire payment system the disadvantages of an account based system according to a paper of the bis are that you cannot ha anonymity vis a vis the central bank and there cannot be private peer to peer transactions without an intermediary as is currently possible with cash see graph source bis committee on payments and market infrastructures cbdcs direct or indirect liabilities the next question should people ha an account directly with the central bank or through intermediary financial institutions here the considerations are not just about what is desirable but also what is practically feasible currently central banks simply do not ha the infrastructure to hold accounts for hundreds of millions of citizens in addition there are regulatory obligations such as kyc and customer due diligence that central banks do not ha the infrastructure and mandates for the most logical outcome would be for central banks to use the existing financial companies to roll out cbdcs on a more technical lel the question then becomes is the cbdc to be a liability on the balance sheet of the central bank or on the balance sheet of a financial intermediary with the latter option the cbdc would be an indirect liability of the central bank also known as a synthetic cbdc the bis does not like this idea centralized vs decentralizedanother choice needs to be made between using a decentralized settlement system or a centralized one firstly for regulators decentralized does not mean the same thing as it does to the industry they see it as a few regulated entities validating the settlement system moreor regular consensus mechanisms ha too much orhead and are too slow for the large number of transactions needed an issue the bis has with a decentralized cbdc is that it means that a decentralized network makes adjustments to the balance sheet of the central bank this increases the risks to the system according to the bis programmabilityone of the main questions a central bank has to ask itself is whether it is going to create programmable money what is programmable money the us federal reser provides a good definition a digital form of money and a mechanism for specifying the automated behavior of that money through a computer program this mechanism is termed programmability in this note across the pond in individual countries within the eu the need for programmable money is being debated hower as you will see in the following sections programmability is an essential part of cbdcs the ecb has en already released an api for institutions to start programming financial stability requirementsthe fact that cbdcs are going to be exchangeable for digital currencies results in some major risks to the financial system after all cbdcs make it easy to pull your money out of a private institution risk and deposit it with the central bank no risk if cbdcs could be freely traded the moment rumors spread that a bank is having issues all account holders will conrt their account balances to cbdcs guaranteed by the central bank you could ha instant bank runs and collapses in the financial system would happen as quickly as they do in the crypto space in addition adding cbdcs increases the total amount of money in circulation creates en more inflation at a time when people are already having problems paying their bills as a result any cbdc needs a built in mechanism to limit the amount of total cbdc that can be issued and limit how much can be exchanged for digital currency in short a programmable aspect of the cbdc has to come into play we will see later how both the ecb and fed are already committed to using financial stability as an excuse to take full control or how cbdcs can be held charged and exchanged monetary policyone of the main activities of central banks or the last decade has been trying to manage the economy through monetary policy up until now these interntions ha not always been effecti in kick starting the economy cbdcs can gi the central banks when properly designed much more direct tools for implementing monetary policy privacyprivacy is one of the main concerns of regulators or at least it is the main concern for their potential users so this issue has to be addressed in the design of the coin it is worth noting that privacy means something different for central bankers and for end users in the crypto space it means that the technology makes it impossible for anyone to track your purchases from the point of view of central banks privacy means that the organisations monitoring and facilitating your payments are under constraints as to what they can and ha to do with your data moreor central banks compare the privacy of cbdcs with data mining private financial service companies and with transactions being e on public blockchains they argue that in that light public institutions are better at safeguarding privacy for the design of a cbdc a central bank has to make a decision as to what lel of privacy a coin will ha taking into account that full privacy is considered incompatible with other policy objectis such as kyc and aml compliance as we will see there are strong indications that privacy as it is understood by the crypto industry is not going to be built into the cbdc system interoperabilitycentral banks will ha to make certain design choices such as whether foreigners are to be able to hold accounts with the central bank or if there is to be some sort of exchange facility perhaps similar to what the crypto industry calls an atomic swap a coordinated cbdc design effort could take a clean slate perspecti and incorporate cross border payment options right from the start private vs public chainon a final note instors in existing blockchains such as xlm or xrp ha been publicly claiming that cbdcs will be built with their chain as the base layer this is simply not going to happen as previously mentioned cbdcs are liabilities on the balance sheet of the central bank there is no way that they are going to base this on an existing blockchain use it would mean they would ha to take full control or the network now that we understand the different design choices available we can look behind the scenes at how central banks are applying them starting with the ecb lt the digital euro ecb design choicesto understand the process of the creation of the digital euro we ha to recap how the eu works this is well described by todd huizinga a former american diplomat to the eu he explains in detail that the eu is run by elites who wish to create an er closer union regardless of the desires of the populations of individual eu countries as a result the eu has created a culture where policies are presented as still being debated and subject to democratic principles whilst in fact behind closed doors the direction is being agreed upon in backroom deals the same seems to apply to the eu s cbdc the digital euro the design and building of the digital euro is at an advanced stage while officially nothing has been decided the reality hower is that the issuing of the euro and logically also the design of the digital euro is delegated to the european central banking system and as you will see in the remainder of this section the digital euro train left the station a long time ago with funding already secured and companies being hired to build the required infrastructure as it stands now legislation is to be finalized in q and only in q will the decision on the digital euro be formally approd note that by then the design will be finished the design choices of the digital euroin the ecb published their report on the digital euro it sees the future euro as a safe digital asset with advanced functionalities and with profound implications for key areas of central banking for the broader economic and financial system and ultimately for the life of european citizens the digital euro would be first of all another way to supply euros conrtible at par with other forms of the euro a digital euro will be a liability of the eurosystem and therefore by definition risk free central bank money programmabilitythe digital euro should keep pace with state of the art technology at all times in order to best address the needs of the market among required attributes are usability connience speed cost efficiency and programmability it should be made available through front end solutions throughout the entire euro area and should be inter operable with private payment solutions programmability is going to be required for a number of desired features there are going to be controls on how much money can be exchanged between different forms of the euro different interest rates on different forms of the euro and limits on what one can hold and or transact in crisis situations there will likely be a maximum amount of cbdc which can be held by one person at no additional cost in terms of monetary policy the digital euro should be remunerated at interest rate s that the central bank can modify or time and with different interest rates applied in different cases to get an idea of how much digital euros each account owner is allowed to own before being faced with restricti measures such as negati interest rates the dutch central bank suggests that euro should be enough for most dutch citizens as it represents one month s living expenses and a financial buffer for unforeseen expenses next to the account features there is work being e on special payment instructions such as payments e between machines in short the digital euro is going to be programmable and not in a way that impros financial freedom account based access and the digital identitythe bis report taught us that central banks can issue a token or an account based system the ecb indeed discusses both as possible options a pure bearer token system as exemplified by regular crypto currencies would take away the control of the ecb thus according to the ecb such a system can only be allowed when both users are uniquely identified for exle with biometrics e g fingerprint and iris recognition the account based system on the other hand would be operated in the same way as the current banking system this is the preferred system of the ecb where they operate the back end while existing supervised intermediaries operate the front end as we see shortly financial service providers ha already been hired to build this system as we speak the infrastructure for the digital euro is being built along with an eu wide digital id this digital id gorned by the eidas regulation aims to help business citizens and public authorities carry out electronic interactions this digital id will contain your relevant data such as name address biometrics drir s licence medical data and will be used to facilitate transactions open bank accounts online shopping financial services such as insurance and god knows what else this digital id was approd in early december but like the cbdc was already being built and funded long before that central or decentralized controlthe ecb s report repeats the bis s options of having a decentralized settlement system hower the ecb is not going for this model they state that the central bank will control the back end and has control or all the units that are to be created other possible featuresother design options are discussed such as the possibility for hardware wearables virtual cards with additional features such as shorter expiration date and spending limits and a pan european merchant solution privacy only for low value transactions the abo statement is from a more recent letter by fabio panetta the driving force behind the digital euro according to him the ecb will explore if they can allow some anonymity in the system the ecb is addressing privacy in response to a public consultation where the ecb asked european citizens what they thought of a european cbdc it receid an avalanche of negati responses and privacy was the most cited worry but the statements of the ecb on privacy are contradictory in public officials tout it as an important feature but if you then look at their most recent internal presentation on privacy they explain that user anonymity is not a desirable feature as this would make it impossible to control the amount in circulation and to prent money laundering the truth is that a gradual shift to digital payments implies less privacy by default the ecb suggests that the digital euro should be designed so that the eurosystem should only be able to see the minimum transaction data hower they are settling the transaction and will need to know who is paying what to whom it is quite clear that privacy is not built into the system the ecb suggests that some privacy can be allowed for certain low value payments and offline functionality hower higher value transactions would remain subject to standard controls lt programming the european cbdc ecb software packageon the th of december the ecb published a package for financial intermediaries to start building applications for the digital euro the publication contained cor letters confirming the design choices discussed abo but also a software package with the application programming interface api a set of defined rules that explain how the computers of banks are to communicate with those of the central bank source ecb website digital euro api package this package provides a programming standard for banks and payment providers that ser the general public it allow them to process payments digitally while the eurosystem settles the payments the ecb is testing a system where intermediaries get to program different kinds of transactions fi companies ha been selected to build software integrations on a settlement layer hosted by the ecb each will test a different type of transaction as an annex to the article one can download the code of the actual api from the source code a number of additional conclusions can be drawn about the model currently being pursued the digital euro will ha intermediaries deal with clients and the ecb ultimately settling all the transactions the intermediary creates the payment the eurosystem appros and then a callback confirms the details of the transaction with details on the time and date it settled despite the non stop bashing of bitcoin by the ecb the current proposal uses the same technology utxo pub private signatures and en the same security model secpk as bitcoin the ecb is literally creating a bitcoin rip off and may en be re using open source bitcoin code the ecb will respond to ery payment request with either settled or failed meaning that it has the ultimate control or what payments do and do not get approval it is unclear what conditions would result in a failed payment gin the large number of transactions the ecb will ha to process and the risk of running complex software at a settlement layer it is hard to imagine the ecb programming payment conditions for specific cases hower running a payment through a sanctions list or a list with basic conditions might be feasible moreor it seems likely that programming features will be enforced at the layers abo the settlement layer for exle the ecb is working on a dedicated programmability platform layer between the settlement layer and the intermediary layers source ecb programmable payments in digital euro the documentation explains how intermediaries create wallet addresses on behalf of their clients it is only this address the ecb sees the more sensiti account details are kept with the financial service provider this is explained as safeguarding privacy hower a permanent record of all transactions is stored all the ecb needs to do is match a name to each address and it sees erything it is as of yet unclear how monetary and financial stability objectis are going to be coded into this system it also is not clear how the ecb aims to reconcile the contradiction of limits on account balance and their privacy goals the latest ecb progress update does not alleviate these worries it states that for online payments the eurosystem itself will record transactions and perform associated rification tasks and it happens to be that online payments are the category of payments with the broadest set of high lel use cases now ask yourself how large a share of payments in a digital currency will be e online in any case it is safe to assume there is not going to be real privacy in this system use with this design either the central bank or the intermediary knows the identity of the users behind each transaction us federal reser design of the digital dollarcompared to the ecb the american central bank the federal reser is not as far advanced with designing their cbdc hower in january the fed did release their report money and payments the u s dollar in the age of digital transformation in the opening paragraphs the fed repeats the familiar take that cbdcs are a different kind of money compared to existing forms and states that in their opinion a cbdc is a digital liability of the federal reser that is widely available to the general public it would be the safest digital asset available to the general public with no associated credit or liquidity risk the report points to the fact that the federal reser act does not allow direct federal reser accounts for individuals the fed will therefore ha to adopt an intermediary model where the private sector would offer accounts or digital wallets to facilitate the management of cbdc holdings and payments just as with the ecb you will not ha an account directly with the fed but although commercial banks and non banks would offer these services to individuals the cbdc itself would be a liability of the federal reser further on the fed argues that a future cbdc should be intermediated widely transferable and identity rified while at the same time being privacy protected these are again contradicting objectis as a use case the fed notes that gornments could use a cbdc to collect taxes or make benefit payments directly to citizens additionally a cbdc could potentially be programmed to for exle delir payments at certain times again programmable money additionally a cbdc could potentially be used to carry out micro payments and streamline cross border payments by using new technologies crucially the fed recaps the risk unlimited use of cbdcs poses to the stability of the financial system as such the fed also proposes the variation of interest rates on different kinds of money and limits on the amount an end user could hold moreor to prent a flight to safety it proposes limits to the amount a user could accumulate in a short period of time and last but not least the fed discusses its monetary policy and the need to expand its balance sheet to accommodate cbdc growth part of this could be mitigated by shifting away from existing non reser liabilities yes the fed is suggesting withdrawing cash to make room for cbdcs new york fed testing of wholesale cbdcsthere were a number of recent headlines reporting that the new york fed had started a week test of their first cdbc hower this project is mostly about exploring the concept of a wholesale cbdc this is a form of cbdc that is only used to settle the liabilities of regulated financial institutions although interesting it does not tell us much about the future of retail cbdcs which are the main subject of this report fednow payment systemfednow is another project under delopment by the fed that is sometimes confused with a cbdc this facility will enable individuals and businesses to send instant payments between accounts while the idea of instant settlement reminds us of crypto currency what is settled are not central bank liabilities as such fednow is not a cbdc system lt conclusion the cbdc prison being builtcentral banks around the world ha started building cbdcs these need to be designed and each design has consequences when looking at the design choices made so far we can see where things are headed and it doesn t look good as of now no formal decisions ha been made in the jurisdictions discussed regardless the eu s direction seems clear perhaps the us congress still has a say in the future of money we shall see what we see in the works is a system where small groups of unelected people get to appro all payments there will be no privacy it has purposefully designed features that control how much money you can hold and what kind of charges and negati interest rates apply a system of constant surillance and the centralization of sensiti information and then we han t en talked about all the other policies increasingly being enforced through the financial system such as a personal co budget or other social credit systems the re directing of private resources towards public policy goals blended finance and the exclusions of political undesirables cbdcs replace cash with a kind of money you ner legally own you can directly be charged interest and fees on and cannot spend without permission do you want this sources this posts is larger than characters so i remod the footnotes from this post full list of footnotes can be found here download this article in pdffor a pdf rsion of this article to store or share click tldr cbdcs are liabilities directly with the central bank they are a new kind of money next to cash and digital money currently held in private banks the bank of international settlements made an orview of all research into cbdcs it shows that each design has consequences the ecb has chose for a design where intermediaries deal with the clients but the ecb settles all payments there is no real privacy in the system to ensure financial stability the ecb wishes to maintain control or account balances apply variable interest charges and monetary policy stimulus the digital euro is in a far stage of delopment the federal reser act forces the fed to go through intermediaries as well the digital usd will be programmable and identity rified to ensure financial stability the fed wishes to maintain controls on interest charges and maximum account balances the fed also argues that cbdcs might ha to replace cash to maintain a healthy balance sheet the digital usd appears to not be in a far stage of delopment , the truth about cbdcs design choices by ecb fed analysed both are aiming at tight control or accounts interest and spending a digital prison is being built in the shadows due diligence ,1.0,1,105sexf,decentralizedlaw,0,2023-01-07 16:02:25,1673107356,1673107356,2023-01-07,16:02:25

ethereum,i'm looking for a command line tool that will allow me to use a separate offline computer for signing and rifying transactions and then use my normal online computer for submitting the raw transactions to the rest of the world i want to manage my own keys and keep the dependencies used as simple as possible i'd really to be able to do operations maketransaction this would take three inputs the fromaddressinhex the toaddressinhex and the amount and output an unsignedtransactioninhex submittransaction this would take an input of a signedtransactioninhex and output details on which block it was included in printtransaction this would take either an unsignedtransactioninhex or a signedtransactioninhex as input and output a human readable ascii rsion of all transaction fields signtransaction this wold take a unsignedtransactionhex and a privatekeyhex as inputs and output a hexsignedtransaction operations and need to be able to run disconnected from the internet operation and need the internet the former so it can look up the correct nounce and choose parameters related to gas prices for the transaction i'm looking for a solution that will keep my funds safe en if the code i'm running is malicious as long as i rify the transaction being signed is the intended one and keep my offline computer disconnected in the past it seems like web js from a node console would ha been the solution but now that the web js api has been promisified that seems more error prone i bought a ledger hardware wallet but am concerned about the risk of the manufacturer being hacked and shipping out malicious firmware and libraries so ha decided to go the offline pc route ,recommend command line tool for offline signing ethereum transactions ,1.0,1,102fnqd,1f9,0,2023-01-03 18:37:30,1672771067,1672771068,2023-01-03,18:37:30

ethereum,hi i ha this particular use case and would like to share it so people can recommend any solution besides building the solution myself so here it is i want to keep some usdc or busd under a multi sign wallet which requires signatures to spend the funds of signatures but i can see a couple of issues with only having parties and needing signatures to perform anything with any funds in that multi sign first death second separation of the parties invold and a need to return funds to each party death if one of the two parties dies during the duration of this trust of funds the remaining party needs to go through and recor the other party's wallet to do anything with the funds which is an annoyance at best separation let's say any of the invold parties want to stop putting money into this trust fund again is that the name of this thing and lea with their corresponding share of the money but the other party doesn't want to sign anything which freezes the funds until the dispute is settled and worst case scenario none of the parties does what the other part asks and a judge gets invold to resol the conflict then some solutions come to mind solving both particular edge cases at the same time involving a third party that plays the role of arbitrator it could be a lawyer who represents both parties but these cost money and you need to trust the lawyer to do the right thing to me what comes to mind is a smart contract is cheaper than a lawyer and you can write one if you know what you are doing to do the right thing but a smart contract can control of the funds and do whater n of m signatures requests right i wonder if a smart contract can be a signer party in a multi sign wallet my reasoning for that is that the n of m smart contract signers control of the funds if someone smarter than the person writing the contract want to exploit a bug the attacker won't get anything of value use he still needs other signers to participate in the hack of the signers in this case okay so the question is there something like this out there in ethereum that can be used for cheap and with a frontend that won't banish suddenly or do i need to build it myself ,a piggy bank with stablecoins in ethereum using multi signature wallets ,1.0,1,zzlf83,shackra,0,2022-12-31 04:33:31,1672461226,1672461226,2022-12-31,04:33:31

ethereum,hi all a little or a week ago i tried to purchase some eth via the top up interface on the torus wallet website using the moonpay option as you can see in both the drop down menu well as the left sidebar the crypto currency options to choose from with moonpay as presented on the torus website are eth matic and usdc as this is my first time making such a purchase i was extra thorough in checking ery confirmation page email i was presented with to make sure that the currency selected is eth as i had wanted to make sure i didn t accidentally purchase matic which made it all the more shocking to me when moonpay seems ha sent me weth weth wasn t en an option to choose from via the methods interface i used so i fail to see how this could ha en been user my error here is the polyscan link to the transaction i submitted a support request on moonpay s website and receid no reply after days i did recei an automated email immediately after submitting the support request saying they typically respond within hours excluding holidays etc if you want to read it here is the message i submitted to moonpay support along with many of the screenshots in this post no new information i han t already mentioned abo though so you can probably skip or reading it so after days i sent a dm to u moonpaysupport on twitter and got this reply note that was to this day still is my first only crypto currency related transaction i er e with that wallet or any other wallet that is in fact the first crypto wallet i er had so it s quite literally impossible that i had e anything else in the past with my account wallet history that was against their terms conditions i ha literally ner had any crypto currency in my possession ownership until that weth they seem to ha mistakenly sent me instead of the eth i had purchased from them with all that said thank you sincerely if you read through this far my questions are am i correct in understanding that i should ha receid eth and not weth there actually is an issue here right gin that u moonpaysupport said this decision is final and we won't be able to provide any further assistance on this matter it seems i ha zero course of action to take in regards to getting the eth i paid for from them any recommendations for where i can reliably safely purchase some eth ideally not from an exchange where i need to submit a bunch of documents to open an account i am canadian credit card has canadian address if that makes a difference my resistance towards submitting documents to open an account with an exchange isn t use i am trying to remain anonymous or anything but use all i want right now is enough eth to pay for some gas fees to transfer some nfts out of my torus wallet and opening an account with an exchange seems so excessi so much work yet here i am typing out this long ass post thank you so much for any help insight any of you can provide ,help please i am confused i bought eth from moonpay but receid weth instead i asked support what happened and they responded only by disabling my moonpay account with no specific reason provided refuse further communication my questions for this subreddit are at bottom of the post ,1.0,1,zyd0wf,pkennethv,0,2022-12-29 18:52:28,1672339961,1672339962,2022-12-29,18:52:28
ethereum,i ha this question in my mind as i hear fear of eth being more centralized as one of the reason being few validators control majority of staked eth coinbase binance etc as ethereum network being merged to pos many long term hodlers are adding eth to stake them m staked i do notice that there is a strong need for being self validator rather in dec cen pools like lido coinbace etc and its not easy rather simple to become validator and stake with eth there fore i ha a suggestion or proposal to bring it to ethereum devs try to bring a mobile mini hard dri device preconfigured and could be become single or multiple validator node's with extension to mobile app to control this device with the size of an iphone connects with wifi lan bluetooth usb charging etc reduce collateral limit from eth to eth or less this way more young instors will start there own validator nodes i am not sure if there is any device available but this would bring ethereum network security to be more decentralized this is my opinion and i wish this to happen soon if its not already there ,would there be a time when eth hold stake them self on simple to use device ,1.0,1,zyb6p2,prestigious_owl4418,0,2022-12-29 17:39:06,1672335560,1672335561,2022-12-29,17:39:06

ethereum,ha you heard about visa's most recent relation that it is working to implement auto payments on ethereum through the delopment of a nol wallet type a procedure dubbed account abstraction by the company according to what i' heard visa did in fact issue a technical paper in which it looked into the idea of creating an automatic payment mechanism for ethereum self custodial wallets i find it amazing what we can all do with the help of modern technologies cryptocurrencies and other things in addition to the payment systems the ticketing industry and other things blockchain may also prent the production of free clean energy i also think that the energy sector will use blockchain in the near future the amount of electricity needed to meet the world's energy needs as well as the effects of the global community on the climate and the cost of energy might be greatly reduced thanks to this cutting edge technology claims elan future enabling auto payments for self custodial wallets is difficult in light of the recent visa and eth news as doing so may require granting access to one's private keys to a smart contract that will be making the payments on their behalf in essence auto payments ha the potential to jeopardize the security offered by self custody the process of confirming a transaction on the blockchain would apparently become more flexible as a result of all of this in my opinion visa for exle belies it would permit multi owner accounts through multi sig and public accounts from which anybody may do business ,visa is looking at ways it can help the ethereum ecosystem delop,1.0,1,zwl0wc,combtimee,0,2022-12-27 17:31:58,1672162334,1672162335,2022-12-27,17:31:58

ethereum,i ha been thinking a lot lately about key management and fund recory it occurred to me that we could create a system that allows us to recor funds from lost keys by signing time bound transactions which can sweep our funds in the ent that we lose access in a nutshell this works by signing a transaction that deploys a contract which sends funds to another address this could be a friend family member or en your exchange and setting time constraints such as not valid before and or not valid after you can also sign many of these transactions with multiple nonce values so that you still ha a valid transaction in the ent that you make future transactions since this signed transaction is constrained to the recipient and certain time criteria it is not sensiti and can be stored anywhere including on the cloud as a user you ha the power to invalidate the transactions at anytime by either spending the funds or using up all the nonces i ha started creating a prototype here let me know what you think of the concept and how you would impro it merry christmas ,idea how we could create timelocked transaction backups to recor ether from lost keys,1.0,1,zu2vvy,bitman321,0,2022-12-24 05:39:21,1671860376,1671860376,2022-12-24,05:39:21

ethereum,eof is the biggest upgrade in the evm's history coming in the shanghai fork in march eof will completely change how ethereum works here's a summary eip the first upgrade in eof changes how instructions to the evm are structured specifically it establishes a structure where one didn t really exist before it splits bytecode into two strings of characters one containing code and the other containing data this eip also makes it easier to upgrade the evm it creates a system to distinguish new contracts and what features each is using the evm executes each program based on the rsion of the evm it was released in so new upgrades can be delired more easily eip this introduces the concept of code validation specifically when a smart contract is deployed contracts today aren t validated by the ethereum network before they re deployed they get validated as they re executed by people validating contracts upon deployment sas significantly on execution costs programs are validated once upon deployment and any necessary data for operation is made available in the data section of the bytecode eip quick tangent stack machines can be imagined as glass containers tall and thin they execute instructions and store data in these glass containers the first piece of data is placed at the bottom and erything afterwards gets placed on top in a stack stack machines ha pointers that can mo between pieces of data to read them the way ethereum shift its pointer today is with a jump which requires a destination or a jumpdest eip 's new opcodes enables the ethereum stack machine to shift its pointer far more efficiently this results in cheaper gas fees both for deploying a contract as well as for interacting with one it also makes on chain analysis easier eip this introduces functions that the stack itself can perform functions are instructions that need to be performed more than once in a program writing such instructions once as a function makes programs more efficient leading to cost savings on ethereum currently functions t exist at the bytecode lel that the stack machine executes on ethereum to repeat instructions the jump and jumpdest opcodes are instead used to shift the pointer to where an instruction is when it needs to be executed eip this eip focuses on validating contracts upon deployment but by looking for errors the stack machine might encounter called stack orflows or underflows stack orflow when a stack is out of space stack underflow retrieving data from an empty stackdespite stack orflows and underflows being basic errors they can occur on ethereum today the checks to prent them are introduced with this eip eof is a suite of eips together making evm execution more efficient more consistent and more easily upgradeable eof itself is first upgrade in the evm's history and can be expected in the shanghai hard fork in march if you'd like to learn more read the full write up on my free newsletter below ,a simple explanation of eof evm object format,1.0,1,ztso6h,phillistine,0,2022-12-23 21:07:55,1671829689,1671829690,2022-12-23,21:07:55

ethereum,there has been a lot of talk about using blockchain for storing medical records but i fail to understand what's the need of a distributed ledger in this case like we can use any db which restricts updating the records for maintaining consistency also it's more secure as it's not exposed to the public and as far as having the data in one's control wouldn't the hospital in case of en a small medical problem can get access to all the patients data which may not be important for the gin emergency thereby posing the same risk of privacy it makes sense in finance cause we need to rify transactions but what are we exactly rifying in case of medical records can anyone explain what's the need of blockchain instead of a normal db ,medical record management system using blockchain,1.0,1,zsoydm,aditmo,0,2022-12-22 15:39:29,1671723585,1671723585,2022-12-22,15:39:29

ethereum,or the past few months ethereum's censorship issue has gotten worse as some validators in charge of maintaining the blockchain's ledger ignore specific transactions in order to adhere to rules purists of crypto's anti censorship moment though may ha cause for optimism i' read somewhere that like of blocks added to the ethereum blockchain in the last day were ofac compliant excluding transactions involving individuals or organizations blacklisted by the office of foreign assets control of the u s treasury department ery week there are various concerns regarding cryptocurrencies the bear market solana's problems the ftx scandal and now this i miss the days when the only issue was high gas fees which we quickly resold with metis polygon or any of these l protocols what s the problem with mev boost since september when we experienced ethereum merge the majority of blocks that are added to the blockchain go through mev boost a piece of middleware that enables validators those who add and appro blocks of transactions to ethereum's ledger to request already made blocks from a community of builders initially the purpose of mev boost was to aid validators in obtaining mev or maximum extractible value which refers to the extra renue that blocks builders and validators can earn by carefully rearranging or inserting transactions within a block as i heard others attribute the decline in censorship to the fact that validators are more willing to connect to relays that are not flashbots now that they ha become more comfortable with the mev boost space what do you think how will sol and do we need to worry about this ,should we be concerned about the censorship issue with ethereum ,1.0,1,zrpc30,finley_dz,0,2022-12-21 14:59:20,1671634771,1671634772,2022-12-21,14:59:20

ethereum,i wanted to share a thought i had about how putting stocks on the blockchain could help stock exchanges in less liquid markets attract instments and impro the lis of those in the region and the best part is it could all be e while encouraging transparency and giving liquidity providers a new way to inst in the stock market so what do i mean by less liquid markets these are stock exchanges in regions or countries where there isn't as much trading activity this can make it difficult for companies to raise the capital they need to grow and succeed and it can also make it hard for instors to find good opportunities but by putting stocks on the blockchain these exchanges can potentially attract more instment from around the world the transparency and security of the blockchain can make it easier for instors to feel confident about putting their money into these markets and for the companies listed on these exchanges it can provide a new source of funding and a way to tap into a global instor base but it's not just about attracting more instment by bringing more activity to these exchanges we can also help to impro the lis of those in the region when companies are able to raise the capital they need they can create jobs dri economic growth and contribute to the orall well being of the community and for automatic market maker liquidity providers this could be a fun and exciting new way to inst in the stock market instead of just being limited to the major exchanges they can now potentially access a whole new world of opportunities and help to dri liquidity in these less liquid markets ,putting stocks on the blockchain from less liquid exchanges,1.0,1,zqux41,godking99,0,2022-12-20 17:56:33,1671559007,1671559007,2022-12-20,17:56:33

ethereum,why is a sizable number of people ignoring ethereum dexes in favor of cexes rumors about binance being insolnt are floating around ct and regardless of the fact that these rumors are probably just that rumors binance or any other centralized exchange should ha ner had this much power or the market binance is technically controlled by a single man cz meaning that one person has the power to make or break the crypto market this is far from what vitalik and satoshi planned for satoshi wanted to get rid of gornment control or monetary supply and vitalik wanted to create an ecosystem that will end up helping us self gorn through defi and daos we already ha dexs uniswap pancakeswap and there are ethereum based organizations like bitdao insting hundreds of millions of dollars into new dexs like apex so there s really no shortage of any sort of decentralized exchanges out there on the market the fact that we re being lazy and purposely relying on centralized exchanges is the problem this is exactly why exchanges like binance pose a huge threat for the market use in a scenario where it fails though unlikely the entire market could go down with itstart using dexes instead of cexes,these cexs only hold as much power as we gi them ,1.0,1,zleo35,deliciousnectarine8,0,2022-12-14 02:20:18,1670984429,1670984430,2022-12-14,02:20:18

ethereum,i think that beyond monetizing time instment in a game freely trading nfts and true ownership of assets there is another benefit that is less discussed which one would you single out as the most important benefit of these games there is real potential to democratize the ability to earn money from gaming shifting the focus away from high lel competiti pro gaming tournaments and toward eryday amateur gamers competing at a grassroots lel this trend is becoming more prevalent in the most recent blockchain gaming models such as win to earn and kill to earn arena shooters this reminded me of wam which has a plethora of tournaments that you can participate in depending on the type of games you prefer my favorites are sports tournaments and each and ery one of them is bringing in really nice profits what game would you recommend as one of the best for making money while also having fun since we're discussing advantages what would you say is a disadvantage of blockchain games ,what do you think are some of the most significant benefits that blockchain games offer to players ,1.0,1,zewwrs,the_phallus_of_joy,0,2022-12-07 09:34:20,1670405670,1670405671,2022-12-07,09:34:20
ethereum,i'm an idiot no doubts about that for more than a decade in crypto i managed to survi without losing a dime to multiple hacks scams losses thefts on friday they caught me off guard here is how it happened so you can avoid it if the same happens to you i was traling together with a family away from my laptop and with my mind focused on other things and priorities a trusted friend who knows me well sends me a telegram message with the following hey isn't this the airdrop you told me you were looking forward to gt link to a tweet he was talking about zksync which i was looking forward to i was aware that no airdrop had been announced and that multiple scam attempts were around a few weeks earlier i used my main eth hot wallet to perform a whole bunch of actions to interact with zksync and just to play around with it so as i was in the car and since i was anxious to know if that was the real airdrop i opened the tweet which btw is still online as of now days later gt i read the tweet and on a quick first look it seemed ry legit it came from what seemed to be a dev blue checkmark fu elon twitter account account joined in k followers retweets fomo kicked in fuck me this must be it erything checks a trusted friend sent it to me and the twitter account is real i already performed most of the actions required to participate the airdrop interact with zksync in different ways all i ha to do is just go to the website connect with metamask and join the whitelist i wanted to get it e as fast as i possibly could so i could forget about it and go on with my family trip no need to check further took me off guard told you so i went on the website if i only paid more attention to the url and connected my metamask mobile wallet to it he asked me to sign something to join the white list then nothing happened ok i made it my wallet was fully loaded as i was gathering liquidity to start a minipool on the next week hour later i recei an alert from a watched wallet on etherscan and i could see my whole eth balance leaving my wallet using the function securityupdate going out to i knew what happened immediately reported the tweet reported the address on etherscan and watch my ultrasound money flying along with thousands of other incoming transactions from other people this person group is making millions as i type and it seems unstoppable to see his funds moving out he is using some sort of internal transactions gt so i ha one important question now should i burn my ethereum address now and ner use it again if i mo ether on it will he she be able to steel it from me again of was just a one off bundle tx he signed he didn't take my nfts nor my ens he didn't take my erc tokens not much fml 't fomo 't interact with web from a smartphone 't keep funds on a hotwallet that you can access from a smartphone 't trust twitter followers retweets creation date and 't trust the blue checkmark ,anatomy of a scam and how i felt for it what to do now people are still falling for it days later ,1.0,1,zeu0f6,adv4nced,0,2022-12-07 06:22:50,1670394187,1670394188,2022-12-07,06:22:50

ethereum,ls ha made major gains in the recent year and ha deloped new tech and upped their throughput ethereum as well has pushing into upgrading the chain in a way that boosts l throughput dank sharding towards the end of hower regardless of how fast a chain l can process transactions there will always be the issue of dependencies what are dependencies dependencies are the result of blockchains and in extension ls processing transactions in a sequential manner dependency is when ery transaction relies on the one before it in order for it to get executed this means that while a blockchain l might ha great processing power all of that power is being focused on one transaction at a time regardless of how significant said transaction really is this put a massi restraint on the capabilities that a blockchain l is capable of performing think of it as you buying a new packaging machine for your factory this packaging machine has slots to handle multiple packages at the same time hower your factory only has one conyor belt meaning so you can technically work packages at a time but practically you re restrained by the sequential order you re forced to follow how are ls trying to sol this issue one way of solving this issue is implementing a parallel evm engine aptos labs deloped a block stm engine and to make it short and uncomplicated for the arage reader what this does is it executes a bunch of transactions in parallel it does that under the assumption that none of the transactions conflict one l polygon adopted a similar approach to their evm in order to scale ethereum but it came with its own set of complications use polygon processes a massi volume of transactions the system that aptos came up with won't work use in a hugely adopted system like the polygon pos acting as if there were no dependencies anywhere in any block won t work it would be taking a theoretical idea too farwhat polygon did instead was write transactions in a data structure called dag if you want you can expand your knowledge on this but in order to sa time and not make things complicated what this does is take dependencies into consideration and then execute transactions before validating so that the metadata with deduced dependencies can be easily executed what does this mean for ethereum while there still aren t any parallel evm chains right now as we saw certain ls like polygon are working on deloping one and hopefully this pushes other ls to follow suitthis is definitely an added value for ethereum in ethereum s new roadmap the chain will rely solely on ls for scalability so this will be major news considering that a delopment like this one will most likely double the throughput that any l is currently putting out all of which will benefit ethereum since its main issue has always been scalability restraints ,here s how ls are planning on moving from fast to en faster ,1.0,1,zejwnz,pihip2,0,2022-12-06 22:18:08,1670365103,1670365104,2022-12-06,22:18:08

ethereum,been researching and adding up my stake in xmr and bch but eth is catching my eye a bit more hower the previous two coins are proof of work which i think i understand the pros and cons of well enough proof of stake on the other hand has me getting pretty mixed feedback and i'm not sure what to think as there appears to still be much uncertainty about the pros cons of pos vs pow from what i gather some thoughts are pros more energy efficient not inherently a bad thing to use a lot of energy but a lot of energy was mined in china which uses less clean sources such as coal or natgas faster lower time complexity and all that more scalable as less computation power is required that means it can run much more smoothly as eth is something of an instment rather than something backed by computation cons more beneficial to centralization and the rich by the model though i will note this arguably applies to pow as any oligarch who wanted to take or could pay someone with technical expertise to set up their own rigs and pay them a commission or something like that allowing potentially for censorship and coopting whether by force or by a attack less secure validators could be bribed more threatened by censorship than pow coins i for one think gornment has no role to play in the creation or regulation of money and that no man should ha control or it in other words i support the separation of state and money for the good of the masses mixed neutral still has high gas fees use case is defi rather than outright cash though in theory perhaps it could be used for that as well bch is trying to get into defi as well from my understanding so perhaps eth could do something in the other direction is this correct are the cons orstated i know less about pos and eth defi in general than i do pow or the coins mentioned abo all feedback appreciated ,how has the transition to pos gone so far ,1.0,1,ze4vr4,lordigorbogdanoff,0,2022-12-06 12:04:19,1670328270,1670328270,2022-12-06,12:04:19

ethereum,hey eryone i had an idea for a pp exchange like bisq for uk and eu but uses open banking ob to get around many of the shortcomings that bisq has i want to get feedback on this preamble recently you may or may not know that stripe released its own r in the us as has moonpay etc i used the moonpay one a few times to buy small amounts of eth for quick tests when i t want to use my main wallet on a transaction i was charged and stripe also takes a ridiculous cut obviously its possible to go through cexs but its not easy to integrate a low fee r onto a defi website and from a cex and people dislike cex s for a variety of good reasons it s incredibly frustrating seeing large fees or complex processes to get tokens into my wallet from fiat bisq has two major flaws in my opinion besides the fact its in the us im from the uk which i would say is more forward facing on the fintech side there is little control or order sizes its not super liquid the payment methods are dodgy on the fiat side most importantly require proof of transaction which is difficulti propose an exchange that combines bisq s framework with open banking and some inspiration from uniswap that should allow virtually free pp trustless flexible ring a seller puts their erc token in a liquidity pool smart contract and signs a hash with the block number which is communicated to the buyer a buyer enters the amount they wish to buy and the price is determined by an amm or gets the spot prices from uniswap binance an algorithm figures out eryone they need to pay and generates a qr to pay eryone you can bank transfer multiple people at the same time in the uk for free and instantly using ob called pisp the hash is in the reference hashed with the buyer address an algorithm scans the sellers data to look for the hash and once it is there uses the hash to unlock the contract using some zk proof and can generate the address from the signed hash of the seller or scans the buyers bank data to ensure the transaction has been made once the contract receis this proof it sends the buyer address the stored token this is the simple rsion i thought alot about the associated problems including being unable to rify account data etc to what extent does this rely on a centralized entity etc the conclusion i reached is that this should feels completely seamless for the buyer thanks to open banking i e scanning qr code i belie in interoperability not competition between good cefi innovations and defi it is completely non custodial at all stages there is actually no cost in this entire process except that of transferring the tokens to sell to a contract i think the concept of liquidity providers earning some fee like as on uniswap can fix potential liquidity problems grateful for any feedback ,idea for pp exchange that runs faster and more smoothly than a cex,1.0,1,zds8t7,bm13131,0,2022-12-06 02:25:07,1670293517,1670293518,2022-12-06,02:25:07

ethereum,a mining pool is a joint group of cryptocurrency miners who combine their computational resources or a network to strengthen the probability of finding a block or otherwise successfully mining for cryptocurrency there are different shades of mining a miner can mine by oneself gt though she would recei all the rewards without having to pay anyone else the approach is usually impractical in reality for casual miners with a mining rig or two the difficulty in popular blockchains like ethereum has become so high that finding a block would take years joining a mining pool gt a miner could join a mining pool by adding her hash power to the power of the group when anyone in the pool finds a valid block the reward is shared among the miners proportional to the work they ha submitted joining a cloud mining gt instead of owning the hardware required to mine herself either individually or in a pool the miner could rent time from existing miners who operate the hardware ,mining pool,1.0,1,z2l4s1,classic-register6841,0,2022-11-23 09:58:09,1669197500,1669818958,2022-11-23,09:58:09

ethereum,why do you play or do you avoid blockchain games what is there to like or dislike i' been wondering since there are not as enough players as there should be how can crypto gaming ecosystems become more resilient some critics say blockchain games aren't fun to play use they focus on monetization too much would you agree with that that is certainly true for some of the first generation blockchain games where delopers were clearly more concerned with the crypto earning aspect than with actual gameplay value since then delopers ha realized that maintaining a sustainable blockchain gaming ecosystem necessitates more than just the ability to earn it necessitates an engaging core game design and gameplay mechanics that can keep players hooked and spending time on the game in addition to a simple desire to earn i played numerous of these games use i'm a huge fan of video games and i'm always eager to try something new there are only a few that made me entertained splinterlands wam tournaments and axie but only at the beginning some pay to win games are based on unsustainable tokenomics another common criticism leled at the earlier generation of play to earn games is that they attract players based on ponzinomics in which the earnings of players who joined the game earlier are dependent on the ability to sell nfts or tokens to new players how do devs expect them to ha more gamefi players when most people are not familiar with basic crypto terms ,some critics say blockchain games aren't fun to play use they focus on monetization too much,1.0,1,z12pno,the_phallus_of_joy,0,2022-11-21 16:08:17,1669046911,1669819518,2022-11-21,16:08:17

ethereum,what are your thoughts on having eth still staked on coinbase should i wrap it and sell it and then buy back into eth and mo to my trezor the price difference to wrap and sell plus the fee would be about an automatic loss which i guess really isn't too big of a deal when looking at how far eth has fallen this year in the bear market still has held up reasonable well compared to the past should i just forget about the loss to do this and get off the exchange asap it's the only thing left on coinbase besides my little bit of algo which i'm about to mo as well ,staked eth,1.0,1,z0ge6d,ritopl3s,0,2022-11-20 21:49:20,1668980978,1669819740,2022-11-20,21:49:20

ethereum,hear me out before burning me at the stake here there are many assumptions taken in this post os clients fallback clients etc and en more edge cases that refute my thoughts this post is intended to shed light on a general case that may apply to many validators if not most gin it would seem to affect vanilla validator configurations validator uptime is a publicly discernable attribute through missed attestations and as anybody running a validator should know critical node maintenance like security updates oftentimes require a system restart that would result in publicly viewable downtime if i was a malicious actor that wanted to attempt to gain access to validator keys by compromising these nodes then this uptime metric could provide me a fast and easy short list of validators that likely ha not gone through this maintenance effort i could en rank my list depending on how long the validator has been online targeting nodes that potentially ha not been restarted in months or years with the assumption that security exploits are more effecti on these nodes missing a few attestations is relatily painless from a financial perspecti if a node operator is hellbent on not performing maintenance on their system for whater reason would it make sense to pay a few cents each month and create a script that would cut network activity to the node for a few hours at the end of ery month if it were me i think i would pay this low cost to avoid being placed on the malicious actors short list then again if it were me i would just update my node instead ,is validator uptime actually a vulnerability signal ,1.0,1,z086ku,pretentiouspickle,0,2022-11-20 16:21:18,1668961295,1669819833,2022-11-20,16:21:18

ethereum,prior to the merge update and the continuous reduction in issuance ethereum like any cryptocurrency network on the market was the unprofitable blockchain hower things ha changed it's important to note that a blockchain's profitability is not the same as a company's profitability in traditional finance technically subtracting new issuance from fee burns allows us to determine whether or not the network is profitable so as far as i can tell the blockchain's profitability benefits neither its holders nor new instors deflation on the other hand has the potential to be a significant speculati growth factor for cryptocurrency in the future hower while the rallying ethereum will benefit instors and traders dapps users and delopers will be forced to make transactions with higher fees and possible network congestion unfortunately during high network loads ethereum requires users to pay up to per network operation i remember at the beginning it was quite chaos dealing with transactions and gas fees i started using metis from the start and the discory of l solutions was the greatest discory for me as far as i can tell lol various foundations and projects hower are constantly working on ethereum's scalability by offering new mechanisms for processing transactions or alternati layer networks that take some of the load off the main network offering higher throughput shorter processing times and low fees ,ethereum turns into first profitable blockchain from top of crypto market,1.0,1,yxtllm,rainmateriall,0,2022-11-17 15:47:42,1668700080,1669820703,2022-11-17,15:47:42

ethereum,according to coinmarketcap the world now has nearly cryptocurrencies this makes determining which ones will be profitable in the long run difficult for instors but my personal favorite is ethereum which is also the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization there are numerous advantages such as nfts use ethereum is the major blockchain where most of the top known nonfungible tokens are launched people are excited about ethereum use the market for nfts is expected to reach more than billion in sales by with a percent annual growth rate this suggests that ethereum will be in high demand use it is required to pay fees when producing or purchasing tokens on decentralized platforms like opensea nfts can now be used to accomplish a wide range of tasks as we all know nfts offer some people the opportunity to make large sums of money hower only some people who deal with them become a millionaire eryone is unique and eryone's risk reward tolerance varies as a result depending on one's perspecti nfts can be viewed as either a lottery or an instment in some cases regarding nfts in lottery systems the lottery industry accounts for of global gambling renue this type of gaming is rumored to be coming soon to platforms like billionair which is powered by a robust token based economy the airb utility token and nft based tickets these can be used to participate in raffles bet wager on and win the best skill and chance games like the crypto scene evols so quickly there are more and more opportunities for ethereum and nft holders what is the most significant advantage of ethereum in your opinion ,what do you consider the biggest advantage of ethereum ,1.0,1,yud14k,the_phallus_of_joy,0,2022-11-13 20:25:43,1668371156,1669821987,2022-11-13,20:25:43

ethereum,do you think that most cryptocurrency games today lack the mechanics to keep players interested for en a short period of time i read one interesting article about this and made me think why han t more top tier games introduced real world rewards into their games i'm referring to titles in which of gamers are not professional esports athletes and recei no monetary compensation for thousands of hours spent playing their favorite games the possibility of introducing monetary incentis has always been on the table why hasn't it been games need to avoid injecting monetary rewards into an experience that is designed to be intrinsically rewarding the gameplay should be most important use that's the thing that keeps players attracted to the game and entertained ha you seen how awesome wam tournaments are well that's the exact reason i'm captivated by that game it's insane and we need more games that are fun and worth playing the fact is that nobody will inst hundreds of hours in an activity that isn't fun unless it pays a lot of money and you can only pay out a large sum of money if a large number of users collaborate to create a significant amount of value this quickly becomes a death spiral for nascent crypto games as the games are unable to generate enough value to adequately reward players for spending hours inside an unrewarding game loop instead of starting with economics or haphazardly adding crypto to a working game loop delopers should create games that people want to play a play to earn mechanism could destroy the retention of en a fantastic game with high retention numbers what are your thoughts ,crypto gaming needs to be fun to be successful money doesn't matter do you agree ,1.0,1,ytdlz1,the_phallus_of_joy,0,2022-11-12 17:41:47,1668274922,1669822336,2022-11-12,17:41:47

ethereum, definitionthe blockchain is operated based on a plurality of nodes configured in a pp method countless transactions are submitted moment by moment from clients all or the world towards countless nodes spread all or the world the results of these transactions are recorded on all nodes and in particular the contents should be the same orall in order to realize this the rule that all nodes must follow is the consensus algorithm to describe it more conceptually it can be defined as a method in which a specific node is selected by a certain rule especially by the decentralization principle the selection and execution order of transactions is determined by the selected node and other good willed nodes independently rify and execute the contents of individual transactions and store them in their database as such consensus algorithms can be clearly defined hower many people are misunderstanding this definition the subject of consensusthere is a serious misunderstanding about it of the general public misunderstands this point and most of the dapp programmers who ha not built the mainnet themsels are misunderstood or ambiguous this is en shown on ethereum's official website there is no understanding of the definition of the consensus algorithm mentioned abo or it is ambiguous the fundamental cause of this problem is the illusion about the subject of consensus in short en though the content of the transaction that's the authenticity of the author is not a subject of consensus it is often mistaken the only subjects of the consensus are the selection of transactions and the order in which they are implemented a the contents of the transaction exactly the authenticity of the author the transaction that a sends eth to b is electronically signed with a private key and deployed to the blockchain network the authenticity of the transaction creator is judged by each of all pp nodes it doesn't get help from anyone outside and it doesn't ask anyone outside hower most ordinary people and surprisingly many dapp programmers mistake the authenticity of the content or the author's authenticity as the subject of consensus hower this is not the subject of consensus but of anti consensus a famous pharase about this is the following do not trust rify as a result en if all other nodes in ethereum conspired to forge the transaction and store it in the database the honest node does not care about it at all and rifies the transaction by itself and stores it in its own database and new nodes joining afterwards will follow the honest node b selection and execution order of transactionsthese are the genuine subjects of consensus no more no less not all transactions submitted to the blockchain are selected and the selected transactions are not executed in the order in which they are submitted this is use it is theoretically impossible as long as the concept of a block of finite capacity is premised therefore there arises a problem of deciding how many transactions to accept in one block and in what order to execute them it is the problem of the consensus algorithm and in itself this becomes the definition of it i selection of transactionsfor exle assuming that suddenly one billion transactions are pushed in one second it becomes impossible to put them in one block therefore we ha no choice but to choose some of them in this case most mainnets collect transactions in the order of high gas prices and put them in blocks therefore en transactions submitted first in time may not be included in the block if the gas price is low they also run later than other transactions with high gas prices en if they are contained in blocks for reference the existing centralized system sols this problem by creating a queue so en if a billion transactions suddenly hit in a second it can theoretically accept and process the whole transactions ii order of execution of transactionsthis is also usually determined based on gas prices maybe all the mainnets are doing that and i' ner heard of that exception in this case it is natural that the possibility of manipulation occurs the answers of existing blockchain protocols to this are as follows code is law it means that you are responsible for not checking the law in advance this is simply an irresponsible attitude for exle if an incompetent legislator incorrectly entered the amount of parking fines and added another zero the legislator is not at fault and you are an idiot for not checking the law this is the current state of the blockchain in the dao crisis the law was entually forced to be revised now it should be law is code the order of execution of transactions must be in the order in which they were submitted at least they should try to do that hower the existing mainstream platforms insist that the current gas price auction system is the right way offering only poor excuses of course eryone knows that it is a lazism the birth of the block conceptas described abo the current consensus algorithms ha a fundamental problem nertheless the reason satoshi and buterin adopted this method was to make centralized manipulation impossible in the selection and execution order of transactions that's they sacrificed the general principle of pre submissionism to pursue decentralization by the way in order to pursue decentralization in the satoshi sense the order of selection and execution of transactions must be determined by a node rather than a specific node hower if countless clients submit their transactions to a myriad of nodes the unity of the orall database will be broken if the transactions are executed in the order submitted for each node therefore he was forced to seek ways to select and order transactions by any random node and to allow other nodes to accept them to this end it is needed to establish rules on who will make decisions on selection and who will follow them as selected by a duly elected selection decision maker other nodes follow it and execute each transaction and store it in their own database thereby maintaining the orall database uniformity it was the pow that satoshi came up with as a way to determine who has the authority to make the abo selection decision that means that the person who sols the high lel math problem the fastest will be gin the right to decide on the selection of transactions hower in order to do this you need time to sol math problems and during that period the transaction queue is accumulated at this point satoshi came up with the concept of the ry block it is the miner who succeeds in solving the math problem satoshi established a rule that the miner selects all or some of the transactions accumulated during the period of solving mathematical problems puts them in one block and executes them and all other nodes follow the rules the block concept of blockchain was born in this con limitations of the meaning of decentralization in blockchainas such the block concept emerged as a methodical element to make it impossible to manipulate in the adoption and order of execution of transactions it was the best way within the limits of satoshi's intelligence the reason satoshi adopted the block concept was of course to achie the idea of decentralization despite innumerable problems such as the execution delay of transactions during the block generation time the rersal of the transaction execution order and uncertainty of being selected in the block satoshi belied that decentralization would be guaranteed if a node was selected from among the innumerable good willed nodes spread around the world and those nodes determined the selection and execution order of transactions and he thought that if only the decentralization was guaranteed he could endure a number of problems caused by block generation if so it is necessary to calmly examine the advantages of the decentralization compared to the centralization system at the expense of such considerable costs for this it is good to make a comparison in other words it is assumed that there is one centralized node and that this node determines the selection and execution order of transactions and other nodes follow suit next the decentralization system is compared with this first there is no difference in the content of the transaction whether it is a centralization method or a decentralization method this is use forgery is impossible thus the transaction in which a transfers bitcoin to b works exactly the same on these two systems and is also stored in the database in the same way it is also impossible for the centralization system operator to produce the abo manipulated transaction from the beginning and both systems are the same in this respect hower there are differences between the two systems in the selection of transactions and in determining the order of execution the problem is that it is necessary to examine whether the difference is essential or relati speaking from the conclusion the difference is only a relati difference and in particular in terms of fairness that is prention of manipulation it can be said that there is nothing better than a centralized system in a decentralized system let's look at this in detail the manager x of the centralized system can arbitrarily manipulate the selection and execution order of the first transaction in which a transfers bitcoin to b and the second transaction in which a transfers bitcoin to c so if x hates b los c and a's current balance is bitcoin x can make the bitcoin which is normal to be transferred to b be transferred to c by manipulating the order of transactions or omitting the first transaction at all satoshi was aware of the abo problems and as a countermeasure he studied how to empower random node operators to decide the selection and order of execution of transactions the result of the study was mining and the concept that arose as an inevitable result of the mining was the block finally at first it seemed that satoshi's idea could be realized without obstacles if there are innumerable nodes and an arbitrary or random node operator determines the selection and execution order of the transaction it can be admitted that virtually no one can manipulate it hower the reality did not go as satoshi thought the first typical situation was the emergence of the mining king in china he was able to exert the power of the operator of a centralized node to some extent based on the enormous hash power and most of all the critical scene was the dao incident ethereum foundation and a series of sympathizers ha artificially manipulated the selection and execution order of the transactions to generate an artificial fork since then countless artificial forks ha been implemented in the blockchain ecosystem as a result satoshi's logic of decentralization has virtually collapsed as an inevitable result the block concept has now fallen into a relati rather than an absolute concept in the blockchain in fact en if it was not the chinese mining king or the dao crisis there was always a possibility of manipulation by arbitrary node operators that is the case when a node operator is preparing to manipulate at that time in case he succeeds in mining if he prepares manipulated codes and allows the codes to be executed when he succeeds in mining or is selected as a validator he can manipulate them for exle with simple code manipulation it is possible to change the selection and order of execution of transactions in a low rather than high order of gas prices as such decentralization through mining and blocks was originally an incomplete method it was not a digital but an analog concept that is on a different lel from the absolute concept of the impossibility of forgery by electronic signature and this result applies equally to pos whether the stake is large or small a node operator can manipulate the selection and execution order of transactions as long as he is selected as a validator but the problems 't end here it's time to ask a more fundamental question is it reasonable to fundamentally determine the selection and order of execution of transactions based on gas prices to say the conclusion in advance it is a manipulation in itself it's nothing more and nothing less than to benefit someone who has offered more bribes let's look at it in detail in general it is right to execute the transaction receid first for exle no matter how much remittance fees are offered to a bank it ner changes the remittance order use it is a principle of nature to process remittances in chronological order there is no reason to treat this principle differently in blockchain therefore if the order is to be rersed a corresponding unavoidable reason must be presented satoshi's answer to this is as follows by extracting transactions in the order of higher gas prices the platform can prent infinite repetiti attacks this is not a reasonable presentation this is a simple security issue and a topic unrelated to decentralization that's it is not an issue to be considered in the stage of building the core of the blockchain that should be considered once the essential structure of the blockchain is completed in other words in the core stage it is right to complete the basic structure so that the transactions are executed in chronological order therefore the infinite repetition attack problem should be considered in the process of considering various secondary problems of the basic structure that has been completed primarily in the process it is the right programming mindset to devise and install a new appropriate additional device separately also such a device is easily conceivable for exle you can find a lot of great methods en at the lel of common sense such as conducting transactions in chronological order receiving costs in terms of security rather than gas and returning them if there are no problems later unfortunately it is assumed that satoshi did not ha time to come up with such an idea as a result the gas costs were forcibly inserted into the core part of the blockchain under the wrong name that's the security costs were inserted under the name of gas costs the aftereffects of satoshi's decision on subsequent blockchains were sere in conclusion satoshi's decentralized method could not achie its original purpose the selection and execution order of transactions could be manipulated and more fundamentally determining them based on the gas prices is just manipulation in itself the gas cost priority policy is an unusual manipulation against the common sense that the transaction receid first should be implemented first and the reason for that manipulation was also poor in conclusion it is inevitable to raise fundamental questions about satoshi's decentralization method that is the block method itself this is not just an issue for bitcoin but a problem for ethereum and all other blockchains disappearance of the blockif all transactions can continue from beginning to end without manipulation and the database can be stored equally on all nodes the purpose of the blockchain is achied a curious result emerges here that is the fact that the concept of a block is not necessary to achie that purpose in addition the fact that none of the existing blockchains achied the essential purpose of the blockchains mentioned abo perfectly at least satisfactorily makes us surprised that means that the block is a failed concept as shown by the comparison of the two systems abo it cannot be guaranteed that the decentralized pp system of satoshi or ethereum has special advantages or the centralized pp system instead by adopting a centralized system but strengthening the devices that control the central main node to prent abuse of authority it is possible to make a more fair and unmanipulatable system than the existing decentralized system for exle a main node temporarily monopolizes the selection and execution of transactions and is forced to select and execute transactions in chronological order then the other nodes monitor it constantly and if it operates against principles disqualify it and appoint one of the other standby nodes as the main node in any case both centralized pp and decentralized pp cannot manipulate the contents of a transaction that's both methods already ha sold the byzantine general problem the remaining issues are of what to select and how to set execution order but rather a centralized system can operate them more fairly the transaction submited first is executed first and the gas costs may not be receid at last we come to a final conclusion the concept of the block is remod as long as the transactions are executed in the order submitted there is no reason to divide and put them in blocks this is no different from executing transactions in chronological order receid by banks or credit card companies they no longer need the concept of blocks the concept of the block was only satoshi's desperate measure and it is by no means a logically necessary concept to achie the purpose of the block chain and the most important fact is that it is desirable to remo the concept of a block as much as possible therefore it comes to the conclusion that the block concept will entually disappear the only thing that remains is the transaction chain now the blockchain must be renamed the transaction chain which will revolutionize the blockchain ecosystem the appearance of nonblockchainat least it is possible to remo the concept of blocks while maintaining the current lel of fairness of decentralization in bitcoin or ethereum more precisely it means that there are theoretically infinite ways to eliminate the concept of the block to impro the selection and execution order of transactions while securing fairness beyond the current lel of the fairness of decentralization in bitcoin or ethereum then what will the consensus algorithm look like if the block concept is actually remod first of all the chain is made up of only transactions this transaction chain also has no fear of forgery at least in the content of the transaction as long as pp is the premise there is no fear of forgery or falsification of the contents of a transaction whether it is on a centralized or decentralized system if so the only thing left is the selection and order of transactions who will decide them this means going back to the point when satoshi created bitcoin based on experience or the past years satoshi has failed on this issue for now therefore we must return to satoshi's initial starting point en if we 't like that and we ha to start or from scratch what needs to be obserd here is one thing and that is enough that's the lel of fairness must be abo the current lel of bitcoin or ethereum complete fairness is impossible it's not impossible in theory but it's practically impossible unless an innovati new technology like rsa emerges the easiest thing to think about is appointing a main node in appointing the main node the status may be endowed permanently or only temporarily the most appropriate answer will be somewhere in the middle of the two it is virtually impossible to appoint and replace the main node only temporarily i e only once for each transaction satoshi was confronted with this ry problem at that time satoshi imagined the concept of block and from this blockchain was born and years later it was confirmed that the concept of block was a failure in this case the most common sense that can be thought of is to appoint a main node under a certain standard and constantly monitor it as a method you may use the platform's own code or you may use a smartcontract and if manipulation or laziness of the main node is detected a method of replacing the main node automatically or by poll is introduced en at this lel the fairness is not inferior to the former chinese mining king or specific foundation led artificial fork creation abo all this method has the advantage of being able to set the operating standards in advance in a smartcontract as a result arbitrary fork generation is fundamentally blocked this is use the fork generation principle itself that other nodes follow the longest blockchain has been remod then it can be said that it is relatily more fair than the existing decentralization system in the end that can be called proof of democracy pod decentralization which is less fair than pod is no longer decentralized entually the religion of decentralization also collapses many people still belie in this myth it is superstition use there is no technical basis the trustlessness has a technical basis called a electronic signature hower there is no such definite technique for the permissionlessness an essential element of decentralization as demonstrated abo the block failed the decentralization has failed in both theoretical and practical ways therefore in this situation calling for decentralization is nothing more than calling for it as a simple ideology it is no more than a cry for th century anarchism decentralization without technical support is nothing more than a mere cry of ideology in reality pow and pos are also fundamentally operated under the control of pod they are no longer decentralized things let's look more specifically pow is not a mining certification method but a mining manipulation method as can be seen from china's mining king pos is also only a method that can be manipulated by stakeholders there is currently no technology or method to prent the manipulations the dao crisis and the numerous forks that ha been conniently attempted since then only pro that the blockchain is accepting democracy its ultimate bastion that is it may be seen that the pow or pos is only a kind of pod at present in other words all existing consensus algorithms are pods pure decentralization independent of democracy does not currently exist therefore the method of selection and ordering of transactions can only be explored based on pod at present advantages of nonblockchain satoshi's block ended in failure hower it has since become the standard for all blockchains most blockchains fundamentally do not deviate from satoshi's basic framework entually all of them disappear or remain only for museum use personally bitcoin's block will survi forer on the other hand ethereum is ry unstable there is absolutely no reason to maintain the block concept in the ethereum c ethereum's attempt to maintain the current block concept is an obvious long term impossibility nonblockchain has many advantages once you can stick to the principle that is transactions may be executed in the order of reception or submission as in the previous exle if the tree method with the main node as the top is applied transactions can be executed in the order receid by the main node furthermore all transactions can be accepted without omission this is the same as the queue concept in a general computer os there is nothing special the nonblockchain would normally adopt a tree structure of course in preliminary the horizontal pp method of the current blockchain may be adopted as an auxiliary method it depends on the mainnet deloper's choice anyway if the tree structure is adopted it can boast the fastest speed theoretically there can no longer be a rapid structure the nonblockchain does not require a concept such as gas price to determine eligibility to be included in a block use the concept of a block does not exist in the first place it is enough to accept and implement in fact the gas costs of existing blockchains are virtually irrelevant to the node's operating costs this is use the execution of transactions and the storage of data are performed in all nodes but the gas costs are only probabilistically paid to miners or validators to be exact gas costs should be distributed fairly to all nodes in this respect the existing gas cost system is extremely unreasonable instead it is desirable to institutionalize a separate method of payment of operating expenses newly and that is possible but that will not be specifically mentioned here the real purpose of existing blockchains collecting gas costs is not for operating expenses the mining rewards are sufficient to pay operating expenses in fact the real purpose of the gas costs was security costs this is being confessed by ethereum's official site in short gas fees help keep the ethereum network secure by requiring a fee for ery computation executed on the network we prent bad actors from spamming the network the nonblockchain collects security costs not gas costs if malicious intent is not positily recognized due to the review the collected gas costs will be returned in this way the security cost may be set high enough without resistance entually by returning the gas costs they become zero as described abo the advantages of the nonblockchain are considerable and there are no theoretical or practical obstacles to its adoption so of course the existing block concept must be discarded and a system consisting only of a pure transaction chain will inevitably emerge the nonblockchain consensus algorithm is bound to be pod for the time being for now we ha no choice but to wait for the emergence of consensus algorithms that can achie decentralization in the true sense by a genius who will appear someday until then it will only be in the form of a pod conclusionthe block was just satoshi's impromptu idea the necessity for hashes to be contiguous is only between transactions not between blocks as a result the name of the blockchain itself is meaningless the blockchain is only one method proposed by satoshi to realize the ideology of the transactionchain the block is not the truth the block concept was only one of the myriad ways to realize the transactionchain and it has now reached the point of disposal the byzantine general problem was not sold by satoshi but was just a problem that had already been sold by cryptography it was the electronic signature looking inside the blockchain at the current stage there are no particularly remarkable technologies other than the electronic signature other technologies are only those that ha already existed or can be deloped by ordinary programmers it is absurd to try to achie decentralization with only such poor equipment in other words the crypto world at this stage does not ha the ability to realize the ideals of blockchain as an inevitable result the consensus algorithm cannot go beyond pod this is the reality of today's blockchain but the spirit of commercialism wants to hide these limitations on the other hand glorify the block to this end they feature the emperor's new clothes the representati clothes are ethereum's future plans the complexity of this plan is indescribable the complexity was all caused by the concept of the block these are temporary complications that will all disappear when the block concept is remod or at least a fundamental platform that heals the problems appears for the time being of course they are successful in dazzling people ,the fictitiousness of the consensus algorithm the failure of decentralization and the emergence of nonblockchain the content is ry long pre scrolling is recommended

ethereum,is there any legal guidance available for us solo staking validators needing to censor ofac blacklisted ethereum addresses my understanding is there is no way to do this in the default vanilla configuration instead you would need to use third party software by flashbots called mev boost and then select relayers that state they will be censoring ofac blacklisted addresses i am unable to find much in the way of formal legal guidance re this obligation there is some factual evidence for us based validators not needing to censor ofac transaction but they are all circumstantial such evidence includes few if any bitcoin miners currently censor ofac transactions ethereum miners prior to pos mostly did not censor ofac transactions the only exception to this was ethermine and they did not start censoring ofac transactions until after tornado cash was added a few weeks prior to the merge there is no indication they censored before tornado cash was added to the ofac list en now many large us based validators are running vanilla configuration without censoring such as coinbase kraken and staked us persumably they would not do so if they thought this was against ofac regulations i am wondering if anyone has any access to any real legal analysis in this regard my concern would be treasury ofac is a dept of the treasury would be more likely to target solo validators to make an exle out of them since they would not ha the resoucres to defend themsels than a large exchange or other centralized entity such as coinbase or kraken then they could use any settlement or conviction as precedent to then go after the larger centralized actors ,legal guidance for us ethereum stakers re ofac compliance,1.0,1,ynj33r,stablerare,0,2022-11-06 06:51:37,1667717510,1669824459,2022-11-06,06:51:37

ethereum,the clash card is a p strategy card based battle game inspired by mediaeval war cultures the game revols around rival encounters in different forts where the commanders align their combat personals in different manners by strategy to launch an attack or defense depending on their cards the core challenge of the game is the design and arrangement of the deck the clash cards game is launched on the bnb smart chain to ensure lower gas fee and higher scalability that is inherent to the bnb chain the game is a decentralized rsion of the centralized game clash royal inspired by the latter the former is designed on the blockchain network to add higher security immutability and play to earn mechanics the blockchain based clash cards is purely an incenti based game where your rewards and earnings can be easily conrted into crypto assets not only the game mechanics drin by the clash tokens but the cards in the game are also nfts deloped on the erc token standard blockchain based gaming by utilizing blockchain technology all in game assets are the player s sole and eternal property use of the security and transparency that blockchain technology provides for their data players can ha more confidence when playing games in a decentralized system players require a certain degree of discretion gin that blockchain technology is based on a distributed ledger the decentralized nodes connected to a blockchain network can create permanent storage for the decentralized gaming environments use the records are stored on chain players can replay previous games for an extended period of time game features the community has a decentralized game economy to distribute authority among different central points it is transferred from the game team to the players and other community members via a gornance model and an invisible hand drin free market gornance currently the clash cards game offers a multi layered gornance model dispersed on different social mediums where our community can easily interact and express their ideas and then vote for new implementations marketplace moreor the game also has its off line marketplace that holds all game inntory for players as the players progress in the game different items are unlocked for their perusal the core purpose of the marketplace is to ensure individuality and freedom of expression to each player gameplay the gameplay revols around collecting and minting new characters or improving the combat abilities of previous characters hence each player has his own experience of the game tokenomics the economy of the clash card game is drin by the clash tokens the clash tokens are deflationary in nature the supply of the tokens will be maintained by the project team to ensure price stability game structure game engine unityd is used to delop the game engine which is a powerful cross platform d engine that ensures a user friendly delopment environment website created on node js which is best for implementing iot delopment projects feature integration it is e through the moralis serr crypting language is c it has following underlying features that makes the use of this crypting language more useful object oriented language automatic garbage collection cross platform backward compatibility better integrity and interoperability our mission our mission is to create a completely decentralized game that provides all features of defi we ha exclusily tried to transform the entire gaming mechanics into a play to earn model thereby incentivizing all activities in the game solely for the purpose of entertainment and earning we belie that entertainment and earning can be two sides of the same coin and with the integration of suitable features one can achie both social media website discord instagram s reddit s ,introduction of clash card strategy trading card game subscription sale li on pinksale th nov utc nfts utility safu audit,1.0,1,yn9nvj,jerriehilger,0,2022-11-05 23:14:29,1667690080,1669824553,2022-11-05,23:14:29

ethereum,ethereum is notorious for being prohibitily slow and costly at the height of cryptocurrency's most recent hype cycle something as simple as exchanging one token for another on the blockchain could ha cost upwards of it's no surprise that l protocols ha grown in popularity so there are layer rollups for those who want to keep their transactions within the ethereum ecosystem and there's a reason why metis and other l solutions ha become so popular layer rollups ha special systems in place to ensure that transactions aren't spoofed or altered before being sent back to ethereum's main chain which is pretty cool in what l protocol do you belie the most and what fascinates you about it did you know that the total value locked in ethereum's layer networks has surpassed billion ethereum's layer ecosystem is undeniably growing although the ethereum merge was the second most anticipated blockchain update this year ethereum supporters ha long hoped that layer growth will help the ecosystem achie mass adoption by lowering costs and making the network more accessible while ethereum mainnet continues to hold the majority of the crypto ecosystem's capital with just under billion locked up layer appears to be catching up quickly ,ethereum's layer ecosystem is undeniably growing,1.0,1,ymrerz,finley_dz,0,2022-11-05 11:32:25,1667647956,1669824737,2022-11-05,11:32:25

ethereum,while many ethereum supporters blindly celebrate meta instagram s mo to launch nfts on polygon they ha been tricked and ignore that polygon is no l and does not benefit ethereum in its current form polygon matic token has launched a vire attack on gullible ethereum users instors by falsely labelling it as an layer solution and piggy backing off most of its infrastructure and hype associated with ls the marketing or better disinformation caign of polygon was well e and convinced many ethereum instors that they are a l when the concept was ry new while this mo is brilliant it is also malicious unlike arbitrum or optimism polygon is in fact a side chain and therefore as much an l to ethereum as solana or other ls like avax are evm compatible chains the latter also tried to position as a spoon a friendly fork they barely burn a few s a day in eth gas fees eth in hours vs gt eth by uniswap alone polygon pos claims that the side chain architecture is temporary and that it will transition into a roll up e g polygon zkevm gt polygon hermez but this remains highly questionable and potentially is another false flag roll ups currently accrue little value and once they become big enough they likely try to create their own ls there is no incenti for them to do this mo there is no such thing as symbiotic relationship between ethereum and polygon as of today and in fact they soak up its economic bandwidth renue it is nothing but a big trojan horse and should be instigated ry suspiciously by the ethereum community going forward ,polygon matic is not beneficial to ethereum and acts as a parasitic side chain soaking up its economic bandwidth ,1.0,1,yme67l,antana18,0,2022-11-04 23:43:06,1667605401,1669824855,2022-11-04,23:43:06

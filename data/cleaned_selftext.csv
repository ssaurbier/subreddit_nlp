0,why ftx u president left tweet thread unrolled from brett harrison's latest tweet an hour ago spilling the bean many have asked question about my time at ftx u and why i left when i did a i indicated earlier this week i m happy to begin sharing my experience and perspective publicly i worked at ftx u for seveeen mohs when my resignation s made public those unfamiliar with my plan were surprised and some questid whether i d been fired it seemed a though i d left a dream job abruptly after a very short tenure the truth s that ftx u hadn t felt to me the dream job it appeared to the industry and medium for some time and my departure s not abrupt my relationship with sam bankman fried and his deputy had reached a poi of total deterioration after mohs of dispute over manageme practice at ftx and a a group of my friend meors and investor knew then i d felt such a strong conviction to found my own company that it sn t worth keeping a dream job no matter the prestige or upside no matter the risk it posed to my reputation in departing so early sam asked me to join ftx u casually over text in late march he s my former colleague at jane street and i had fond memory of his presence there we d barely stayed in touch over the year but i d occasionally read news about ftx s growth i s happy to hear from him and ierested to learn more about how thing were going at ftx i d n sam to be a conscieious junior trader at jane street who d e well in the programming for trader course i taught there in which he d been my stude in manager meeting about sam s performance the senior trader on his desk indicated he had promise beyond that he seemed a sensitive and iellectually curious person who cared about animal and that endeared him to me my negotiation to join ftx u moved quickly a welcome corast to the mohs they d taken for every move i d made in traditional finance i d built softre for jane street s crypto desk in but hadn t worked on crypto since i s excited to dive back in my first few mohs at ftx u were wonderful i worked largely independely of sam to grow a u based team and foster a professional environme prepared for regulated business i made plan with the ledgerx team built out legal compliance and operation departmes with first in class lateral hire and began setting up and building a u regulated retail stock brokerage ftx u s spot exchange s growing in market share the team s dedicated and productive customer feedback s positive i s excited about the future but from the start i noticed that while sam s rarely engaged on the u business decision impacting the u would come without rning from the bahamas six mohs io my time at the company pronounced crack began to form in my own relationship with sam around then i began advocating strongly for establishing separation and independence for the executive legal and developer team of ftx u and sam disagreed i saw in that early conflict his total insecurity and iransigence when his decision were questid his spitefulness and the volatility of his temperame i realized he sn t who i remembered i sn t sure what accoued for the dramatic change i saw in sam many of u i have family and friend who live with addiction and meal health problem and i ve seen how these problem often manifest without much rning in early adulthood i thought that might be a coributing factor and initially felt sympathetic but i didn t sam well enough personally or have any real time to reflect on the question i s in a business relationship with him and he s making a number of decision about running a business that i disagreed with there s tremendous pressure not to disagree with sam but i did so anyy at that time and for all of my time at ftx u his influence over the medium ftx s partner the veure capital industry and the traditional finance industry s pervasive and unyielding standing up to an insecure prideful manager is hard under any circumstance but it s nearly impossible when every day every major voice of culture and commerce deafens you with a narrative that implies if you disagree with your manager you clearly must be wrong i sn t the only at ftx u who disagreed with sam and member of his inner circle ftx u s staffed with experienced professional from u finance firm law firm and regulated exchange our collective experience and professional acumen were frequely treated a though they were irreleva and valueless it s extremely frustrating for all of u over the ensuing mohs i further argued for enacting a sensible hiring policy for staffing ftx u with a c suite of experienced officer for transpare communication between sam and ftx u leadership for gary ng s and nishad singh s softre developme responsibility to be formally ideified and shared across a larger group for the delegation of managerial responsibility and corols beyond sam and bahamas based executive and other importa matter sam s uncomfortable with conflict he responded at time with dysregulated hostility at time with gaslighting and manipulation but ultimately chose to isolate me from communication on key decision making it felt terrible i sought out information about decision that had been made behind my back desperate but trying hard not to show it in early april my eleveh moh i made last try i made a written formal complai about what i saw to be the largest organizational problem inhibiting ftx s future success i wrote that i would resign if the problem weren t addressed in response i s threatened on sam s behalf that i would be fired and that sam would destroy my professional reputation i s instructed to formally retract what i d written and to deliver an apology to sam that had been drafted for me that eve solidified my decision to leave i knew an abrupt departure would be harmful to the company and my ftx u report and i ed to best position the company for future success after i left so i gradually wound down finished building and releasing the u stock brokerage and saw ftx u employee through their mid year review and with that i shifted my focus to the future and to my own company the information that is now in the public record from indictmes complais guilty plea or otherwise show fact that even now after mohs are difficult for me to assimilate io reality i raised concern at the company believing that the manageme and organizational issue i saw were typical of growing start ups and that my role a an experienced financial service executive s to correct them and unlock the next stage of the company s growth i never could have guessed that underlying these kind of issue which i d seen at other more mature firm in my career and believed not to be fatal to business success s multi billion dollar fraud it s clear from what ha been made public that the scheme s held closely by sam and his inner circle at ftx com and alameda which i s not a part of nor were other executive at ftx u i understand now why they carefully concealed their criminal activity from u we have extensive professional network our own line of communication with u regulator and our own authority to speak to u medium if any of u had suspected let al learned the truth we would have reported them immediately over my seveeen mohs at ftx u my colleague and i dedicated everything to serving the need of our customer and growing real business we believed offered consumer a y to more equitably access financial service that are ceral to their life ancie form of greed and dishsty destroy trust and corrupt progress the scale of this particular instance of this lesson is difficult to comprehend but far from exceptional in the twelve year of my professional experience in finance it s a strange dissonance after i left ftx u and up uil november nearly every conversation i had with a veure capitalist about my new company eveually came around to the same kind of question is ftx investing is sam okay with you doing this do you mind if we confirm with him after that many conversation eveually came around to the same kind of apology we you weren t involved in what sam and others did but we can t take on the pr risk of associating ourselves with ftx no matter how capable you are or compelling your idea is the last few mohs have provided me with a valuable character study of the industry some treated me an eirely differe person overnight some immediately offered sympathy and support it will be a difficult experience to forget it will also be difficult to forget the frenzied and baseless accusation leveled against me on social medium for emple that my resignation could only mean i had ledge of a criminal scheme even though there s no evidence of that and available information show the scheme s run by a small number of people in another coury and began year before i joined ftx u or that i m seeking a plea deal even though i haven t been accd of wrongdoing and am not a target in any investigation or that while at ftx u i colluded with citadel to manipulate tokenized stock price yes people are actually saying this i m grateful from the bottom of my heart to those who showed me unvering trust and support through the turbulence of the last two mohs they helped me cut through the noise and remain focd on the future even a they themselves had been harmed by the tragedy of ftx s collapse i credit them along with my family with getting me through the most devastating and destabilizing eve of my professional life i m extremely honored to have them a partner the path ahead of me is clear now and i m excited to move forrd together with them source

0,my personal thought and feeling about bitcoin being ideology bitcoin represes differe thing for every but in such a polarized world i find refreshing that people can stand side by side for something that they believe even though their reason to believe it is differe some people here for having the option to keep their saving out of the hand of any institution some just believe the number will rise some actually this will free people and provide every a better future a good thing about bitcoin that it aligns inceives and since the inceives are all aligned even if some here for the altruistic reason or selfish reason it doesn t really matter and that s a good thing and i feel hope real hope for the future maybe for the first time of my life that we can still unite and build something together slowly but surely i have difficult time to understand why people care about it so much and feel the need to talk badly about it if they believe it will go to zero dollar i t understand the hate or frustration behind it a a couer argume can say the bitcoiners show a similar attitude tords shitcoins but i the real frustration there is not related to the pricing of other coin the frustration is there beca bitcoin represeed and understood by lot of people under the umbrella of cryptocurrencies and the scammer using their fabricated and corolled currency is damaging to what bitcoin is trying to achieve this is a long road and i myself still very new to this ecosystem and when you about it and everything started from people and now couries discussing it some accepting some refusing energy company starting mining it feel difficult for me to go back to zero but a i said at the beginning apart from the price perspective it is really refreshing for me to be able to believe in something and do something for it it s something that i can feel lacking for my generation so i m happy to be be here and be a part of this journey

0,multi vendor multi sig sparrow wallet one of if not the best self sovereign solution to self custody there is a lot of fear around setting up a multi sig whether it's the setup itself or the fear of restoring the from scratch it can be iimidating to move from single sig io the wonderful world of multi sig but it's worth it a your stack grows to be a more and more substaial part of your wealth so will the fear of losing your stack via a single poi of failure with single sig i that there are y to create redundancy and security with single sig e g sd card backup multiple seedphrase location passphrases but i would argue that if you are willing to create redundancy and extra security with single sig you already have the motivation and ly the technical expertise to move to multi sig so eer multi vendor multi sig sparrow first why multi sig in general there are two major compelling reason for multi sig redundancy from single key loss or theft this is obvious plausible deniability in a wrench attack this second s the main that made me move to multi sig in the ever increasing world of data leak and kyc it ha become almost impossible to stay incognito a a bitcoiner having multi sig make the effort to physically coerce you so much more difficult if an attacker ha to transport you to another location especially if it's a public place a bank security deposit box and a multi sig becomes the norm then physically coercive attack become le tempting a a whole in the space second sparrow make multi sig setup a breeze to start it's open source the ui is so much more r friendly than electrum and it automatically prompt super importa step downloading the backup script to restore the it ha been formatted to work seamlessly with almost all the major hardre s finally why multi vendor multi sig why not just coldcards in a of setup or trezors in a of setup by creating a setup where no vendor ha a quorum of key e g coldcards bitboxes trezor you remove that tiny little worry that of the company could be malicious and ha somehow gotten your key either via a usb connection or incomplete eropy at key generation or that you've been the target of a supply chain attack technically you should even be able to trust closed source hardre s e g ledger in a setup this still recommending open source though a a matter of principle in the bitcoin space however if you go down this route these are the absolute imperative to setting up a multi sig you must backup your and store a copy of all the xpubs preferably in both electronic and physical form if you need to restore your from scratch you will need the xpubs of all the key not just a quorum this is by far the biggest pitfall of multi sig luckily sparrow prompt you to create this backup at the time of creation at least preferably all of your hardre s need to be able to verify the multi sig including the xpubs of all signer on the device i won't go io too much detail but malre could insert additional cosigner at the time of creation so you need an external validation of the setup hardre s that i can do this from personal experience are bitbox coldcard and foundation passport i'm sure there are others but i can't speak to those this applies to both single and multi sig but you should alys verify send and receive address on the hardre device itself i will plug for foundation passport on this they make receive address verification via qr code very streamlined there's a lot more to the actual of multisig including using psbts with certain hardre s but these actually 't differ from single sig other than having to do it multiple time rather than just once per transaction i could go on and on about other aspect of v of storage location of key seedless setup but this post is getting long if you are ierested in seeing sparrow in action with multi sig here's a great video that finally prompted me to go with sparrow s multisig start at

0,exponential growth understanding and the lack there of a it relates to btc in which i s speculating on btc s usd price to exceed k in and eveually become the global reserve currency within year let get io it human being have a hard time understanding expial growth for a number of reason of the main reason is that our brain are wired to in linear term we are d to thing growing or changing at a steady rate and expial growth doe not follow this pattern expial growth is characterized by a rapid increase in which the rate of increase itself increase this mean that the growth becomes faster and faster over time a common emple of expial growth is the concept of compound ierest if you invest a certain amou of my at a certain rate of ierest the amou of my you earn will increase over time however the rate of increase will also increase so the longer you leave the my invested the more it will grow this can be hard for people to wrap their head around beca it go against our natural instinct we are d to ing about thing in term of how much they increase by a certain amou over a certain period of time expial growth on the other hand increase by a certain perceage over a certain period of time which mean that the rate of increase itself increase another reason why human have a hard time understanding expial growth is that it is difficult to visualize when we about growth we tend to about it in term of physical object or quaities that we can see and touch however expial growth is not something that we can easily observe in the physical world it is a mathematical concept that is difficult to visualize which make it harder for u to understand a further reason why expial growth can be hard to understand is that it is often coueriuitive for emple if you start with a small number and double it repeatedly the resulting number may not seem very significa at first however if you keep doubling the number it will eveually become much larger than you might have expected this is beca each time you double the number you are adding a much larger amou than you did the time before finally human have a hard time understanding expial growth beca it can lead to seemingly impossible or unbelievable outcome for emple if a virus were to double in size every day it would seem impossible that it could take over the world in just a few short week however this is ectly what can happen with expial growth it may start off small but it can quickly become much larger than any could have predicted if you are still with me and are having a hard time connecting the concept of expial growth to bitcoin let me explain bitcoin a deceralized digital currency ha seen expial growth since it creation in of the main reason for this is that bitcoin ha a limited supply there will only ever be million bitcoins in existence and a more and more people become are of and ierested in bitcoin the demand for it increase this limited supply combined with increasing demand ha led to the price of bitcoin experiencing expial growth over time however this expial growth ha also made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin beca of it non linear growth it is difficult to traditional financial model to forecast the price of bitcoin this ha led to a great deal of speculation and uncertaiy surrounding the future of the currency another factor coributing to the difficulty in understanding the expial growth of bitcoin is the fact that it is a relatively new and highly complex technology the of blockchain a deceralized ledger that record all bitcoin transaction add an additional layer of complexity to the currency this complexity can make it difficult for people to fully understand how bitcoin work and how it is valued the expial growth of bitcoin ha been driven by a combination of limited supply increasing demand and the complexity of the technology behind it this growth ha made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin but ha also attracted a great deal of ierest due to the poteial for significa return on investme in conclusion human have a hard time understanding expial growth beca it go against our natural linear ing is difficult to visualize is often coueriuitive and can lead to seemingly impossible outcome it is importa for people to understand this concept however beca it can have significa implication in many differe area including economics population growth and the spread of disease tldr expial growth is difficult for people to conceptualize beca it go against our natural linear ing is often coueriuitive and can lead to seemingly impossible outcome btc ha already experienced expial growth multiple time and is still in it infancy dca and hodl

0,bitcoin exchange standard bitcoin maxi love the idea of bitcoin becoming a widely d a a deflationary currency and it is often compared to gold a a store of value let s look at the history of the gold standard a a comparison specifically the departure from the gold standard leading up to and after wwii the gold standard s spped for the bretton wood system uil it s erased by nixon in the early s executive order enacted under fdr required all american to submit their gold to the federal reserve bank after the r the bretton wood agreeme signified a change in the global system in which all couries in the agreeme were required to guaraee convertibility of their currency io u s dollar with the dollar convertible to gold bullion for foreign governmes and ceral bank at per troy oz wikipedia this mean all couries exchange for u s dollar backed by redeemable gold but that gold is only redeemable by bank and governmes not your average citizen now my question is highly theortecial what if the u s enacted a similar order for bitcoin in the ke of a collapsing global market and it s made illegal for citizen to hold bitcoin the governme pinning the value of the dollar at a certain number of satoshis there would be a branch of the federal reserve devoted to mining rogue mining operation would be highly illegal and other couries would compete for maximum mining output this would have dramatic effect on the developme of the cryptocurrency industry and on the world there would be many negative and positive what do you i t actually this will happen but it an ieresting scenario keep hodling

0,i have big question about bitcoin transaction i'm trying to understand some thing about bitcoin and i've been searching for day tching video reading article n of them have explained it to my absolute understanding it's frustrating question transaction input where ectly do the input come from i lear they are utxo's unspe transaction output from previous transaction which transaction and to whom doe every payme that come to me generate a new utxo so for emple if people have recely se me btc to a single address i own do i have separate utxo's to spend a input for my next transaction that s my reasoning and it seemed to be making sense uil i came across info that said the input can come from differe address huh okay look they have a poi though beca when i check the block explorer for transaction i actually see distinct address a input and output it should mean that every address can rather only have utxo at a time right and multiple utxo's should definitely come from differe address but if multiple address are d a input shouldn't all of them be owned by the sender beca only the sender should authorise a transaction now if that's the case how is that e beca with the s i've d trust and binance i 't see an option to select multiple address i own and combine their value when i'm sending btc so what's happening can multiple input only be achieved using low level coding or something when i search for how to send bitcoin from multiple address or similar i 't find anything that answer my question it's a if that's not possible i'm just not getting it for the output i understand but the input haven't really been explained to me can some who understands this from a to z spell it out for me without leaving anything out i'd be really grateful question block confirmation and reversibility many source say that transaction that have or more confirmation can be considered irreversible okay logically that should mean that with le than confirmation the transaction can be reversed now what i about block confirmation is that it's the number of block that have been added to the blockchain after the that coains the transaction in question so that mean even with or two confirmation the block is actually on the public blockchain right so if the transaction can be reversed how is that e will it be pulled down from the blockchain funny question what would happen to the block after it meanwhile if you search for can bitcoin transaction be reversed all the answer you get are no so what's really the poi here

0,the basic economics of why bitcoin ha value i've been seeing a lot of new people that seem to have no grasp on the basic of economics regarding currency what give it value etc i posted this a a comme in another thread that didn't get much atteion so i thought i would post it again a it own post to help those who are new to bitcoin or 't have much understanding of the fundameal value proposition of bitcoin a a currency first you need to ask yourself why the dollar ha any value learn a bit about the history of my the first currency were commodity my they derived their value from their irinsic but they were cumbersome to so we inveed paper my that s backed by commodity such a gold which could be exchanged for it and gave it value in the u fed stopped allowing dollar to be exchanged for gold making our my fiat my with no backing fiat mean command it is created out of nothing by an issuing authority now about what the federal reserve ha been doing and the effect their action have had on the economy they previously lowered ierest rate to ierest rate are the cost of obtaining my my that ha no cost to obtain ha no value and an unlimited supply the my supply ha been increased by more than over the last year and much more than that over the previous ceury you can view the fed's own data here the value of the dollar over the long term is trending tord zero along with every other fiat currency look at this chart and see how much value it ha lost over time s most my is already digital it's just a database in your bank's server that ha name associated with amous le than of the my supply exists a cash it would be impossible for every to convert their electronic deposit io cash bank actually create extra my in the my supply when they make loan reserve requiremes were suspended in the covid era meaning bank could create unlimited amous of loan with no reserve at all this is stuff you would all learn in an iro economics class but it's very fundameal to understanding why any currency ha value or loses it value my derives it value from being something that is fungible durable divisible portable and limited in supply the more of these property it ha the better it is a my it must serve a a unit of accou a medium of exchange and a store of value the better it is at these thing the better it is a my bitcoin ha all of these quality making it ful a my it's much more divisible than the dollar much more portable and more limited in supply so far the bitcoin network ha never had a major outage or hack it is free and open source with out a ceral authority so far it value ha only g up over the long term despite it high volatility in the short term limited supply is esseial a currency's poteial a a long term store of value many couries have hyperinflated their currency with disastrous result right now around the world many couries are experiencing extremely high amous of inflation learn about what ha happened in argeina venezuela zimbabwe hungary and many more couries due to hyperinflation it's a crisis around the world almost all the world's couries fiat currency now many people in these couries face authoritarian governmes or do not have access to a stable currency bitcoin ha obvious fulness to these people a well a any else who s an alternative to fiat my that will do nothing but lose value over time

0,assuming bitcoin will need a smaller unit than sat eventually how doe that look from a technical point of view due to bitcoin's hard cap if bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency and all thing become naturally priced in bitcoin this would mean that each bitcoin and each sat will become more and more valuable a the economy grows i assuming the economy will grow indefinitely is not a trivial a i'm making it sound but let's just assume it'll be the case for this thought experime so basically thing will cost le and le bitcoin and we will reach a poi when a single gummy bear will be worth le than sat at this poi we'll need a smaller unit in order to pay for everyday stuff even a cup of coffee will be worth le than sat eveually hell you could say that about almost anything if you go far enough in the future assuming the human race survives till the universe end so my question are what's the code change needed to make this a reality is it just changing some value on a line of code in github and then of course the majority of the node accepting the change if so where is that line why sn't bitcoin made infinitely divisible in the first place are there some technical issue that would arise if this s the case what's the reasoning behind choosing million per bitcoin a the lower limit and not million or billion

0,bitcoin in the far future the only thing i is missing about bitcoin technology is a y to really slowly recycle itself let me explain imagine in thé far future when all bitcoins will be mined or almost the biggest bitcoin source available will be old storage from our time old accou lost bitcoins etc they will probably be an industry trying to found them back in a y or another the amou of lost bitcoin will be massive and compared to thé mining production they will be a time where finding only a single hard from our time could be worth of multiple year of mining production this is not a sane balance for an economy the non lost bitcoins will be d for thé economy but if they are btc holder who are too big they will own a too big of thé total amou of my to exist let s say a familly for exemple that inherited bitcoin from generation to generation they could or own stupid amou of thing or acting by themselves a a modifier of bitcoin value order of magnitude too high probably with the ability to make price triple or divide by easily if a my this exist in far future propose who are not privilegied by it will legitimately look ay for other solition and probably create other cryptos collectively and decide to them instead what would be a imo sane thing to do is adding a evaporating rate to bitcoin let me explain to avoid that few people could own too massive proportion of bitcoins and keep the currency viable and fair enough to let people coinue to it we could maybe add a system who could make a small évaporation raté happen so for exemple each year of the btc you own evaporate and go back to the mineable bitcoin pool number can vary this will also allow a reneble and consta suply of new btc this is the most equal option every have the same evapotax we could also balance this in a more fair y evaporzting bitcoin faster for biggest bitcoin holder above some cap to avoid people to squeeze this by dividing their wealth io multiple accou we will need them to be or nominated to a single person or to a single family and a y to make sure it is not squeezable then let s say that for each time you own x more than the average accou balance to let this method grow with increasing of decreasing population you pay twice more so per year evaporate of your btc above time the average balance above time the average above time the average k m time thé average etc etc evaporate per year at million time the average at million time at a billion time etc that also add an inceive to make thé average people wealthier so it will be really hard to own more than a billion time the average person wealth who seem a minimum to keep thing somehow balanced of course that s random number that could be adjusted up or down that will keep the economy somewhat balanced and allow more evaporation to happen and at the same time still allow for big fortune to exist but without having too much inequality capped in this exemple at billion time the average beca after that evaporate per year so basically all of it we could maybe even imagine a system where the under average balance get a small perceage of wealth evaporated from big we could say that half evaporation go to mining and half to slightly lower inequality could be a modest redistributive and fair economical system we need also a y to make people who die inherit their fortune to their kid to avoid the death people accous to cou among the total number of active accous and if not possible redistributed to the mining pool this y we could have a mtary system bitcoin with a fix amou of currency a y to slowly get back poteial lost bitcoins trough evaporation a y to slowly give back bitcoin to the mining pool and keep the suply running a y to avoid too much inequality but still allowing fortune to exist without allowing too indece s or monopoles to a y poteially to redistribute a part of the wealth to the le fortunate trough a part of the evaporation we could call this condensation on lower than average or average balanced accou this will be a low amou in any case beca lower than average accou and average accou will be much more in number than the above s who pay for it and that s how you keep a currency system sane stable and fiable for extremely long period of time and make it automatically adjusted to total population number change up or down allowing humanity to eveually becaume a multi planetary specie a we should be if we are not filtered out of existence before and that s how you also assure people to be able to keep a stable deceralised predictible non inflationist currency who evaporate or not at all or reaaaly slowly depending on how rich you are also putting a smaaaaal pressure on people to spend or invest and keep the my moving in the economy being rich is this world would only mean owning a bigger part of the cake who evaporate faster and of nothing is e or if badly d or lost will go back to average with time trough evaporation who go half to the le fortunate half for the miner who keep the thing working a bitcoin made on this kind of system could be much more viable long term and even becaume a ultimate and universal currency aly adjusting itself to any situation to go back to the society wealth distribution programated in some year and still of course remunerating miner and mining who make the system work and coinue to that s an ieresting topic imo and could be the solution to a lot of issue that today currency have or even cryptos have or even deceralised cryptos have exc my bad english

0,bitcoin is a social construct not crypto since bitcoin had a price people have tried to recreate it but with twist the owner of this get a huge chunk of supply then supply get released when mining or this ha this cool developme team or technology behind it therefore better than bitcoin these recreation all focd on the idea of bitcoin a a technology when in fact even the technology d to run bitcoin is subject to change at the whim of social consensus take robux for a minute robux is a popular digital asset issued by the robux corporation it ha exchange though mostly underground for fear of reprisal from the robux corporation what is the functional difference between robux using an sql database between their server and robux using a private blockchain where only robux server can create the proof of work for transfer it still permissid robux still ha full say over whether transfer even happen between accous and robux is still sold by the robux corporation crypto is much more akin to robux in this y crypto is not subject to the whim of it rbase it is only subject to the corporation behind it bitcoin doe not work in this y bitcoin is a social construct the bitcoin core devs have e a pretty good job at making sure nothing that would upset the people who run the softre get through but what would happen if they did new rule block size will now be gb instead of mb the first problem they'd run io is that the new softre is not compatible with the softre every else is running people who run the softre would be pretty upset at hard drive space filling up rapidly and fork the project io a new repository you now have two chain but which chain is bitcoin so that's what i mean when i say bitcoin is a social construct any argume you'd make over which get to be bitcoin is you enforcing that social construct the curre construct around what is bitcoin is that the chain that is compatible with the older softre get to be bitcoin it but the original bitcoin github repo get to be bitcoin i hear you scream so let talk about the next problem the original repo would encouer from ignoring the people who run bitcoin when you a bitcoin and you 't run your own node you the node that softre default to now maybe that softre enforces the idea that bitcoin is the core repo but it could just a well decide to enforce the social construct that bitcoin is whatever is compatible with an older version of the softre in fact it probably would do this by default via not noticing that a new clie s even released i mean i can't help but notice that this very sub ha a link to download version of core even though version s released miner and price i can't talk about the role that miner would play io this without also including how the price of each chain would effect the miner if r prefer to chain over the other it price will go up which make miner to mine that chain instead of the other this mean the chain that go against the r wish is vulnerable to the hashpower of the chain that support r decision being part of the domina mtary network ha it perk the domina mtary network is evidence of the strenh of the social construct at hand right now the strongest social construct for my is that governme issued paper is my bitcoin is here to challenge that social construct with it own

0,lntip this post is for those who have been tipped maybe the tipper linked this post to help you or you to learn more about lip on the bitcoin sub r lipbot for more official information non you can start right now without set up you just need some to tip you i recely discovered there is a tip bot that you can in the bitcoin sub and i others the great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning and then withdraw your tip or your own lightning to add sat to your personal tip jar you 't need to if some tip you sat then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your rname and add in sat to it that's the minimum tip then you can the same command in a message and tip some else no need to even set up a you can sat all you just from your own tip get them and pas them on side note you can send private message to the bot and it will give your balance or a code to send sat to or receive sat via lightning just using the link on the bot reply to tip type lip or any number higher than it will tip the person you are replying to if you 't have the fund available in your accou for the tip then the bot creates a lightning invoice that you can pay using lightning with a setting up a lightning and adding sat to the bot a great guide from double lr tip him if he post in commes i muun too so you are in luck it work a very small bit differe than you i am on a ph so this is what i just did to transfer sat from the tipbot balance to my muun very easy you ll see prior to doing this you must have the fully set up get your seed phrase word aka your key and write them down and keep them safe then do the rescue emergency pdf thing too it s pretty easy and worth the hassle of figuring it out after that open muun and select receive at the top there are two option button select lightning and the screen will change to a lightning address at the bottom you will see invoice setting select that and you will see a button to add an amou and an expiry time for the invoice press add and eer the amou you to withdraw from the tipbot balance press confirm and the invoice will change again to the address that represes what you just created an invoice for the amou of sat you eered press copy and the invoice will be copied to your clipboard in your ph open reddit and find a tipbot message it ha the blue link in it you see it every time a tip is given press withdraw and it will create the dm format for you once you learn the format very simple you can create it from scratch a normal dm but the blue link doe this for you uil you learn the format well enough to create it on your own on the dm page created by the blue link there is a spot that say put_invoice_here delete only that simple phrase and then paste in to the same spot and your invoice you copied earlier will appear the line that say withdraw need to stay where it is press send open muun a fast a you can and see if you can beat the withdral to your from reddit enjoy fellow redditor it seems a lot but i m reality step will become step for you and step will also become step for you so once you learn it it s basically two step lightning is badass enjoy fellow redditor

network it allows you to send sat super fast and cheap what is a bot an automated service to help you 't worry about sending message to it a long a you 't change the word it's just sending a command to a computer and it will return your answer privately do i need a perhaps not you can be given tip and then check your balance here on reddit and only tip others using your tip a great little circular community but then i do need a yes when you either have so many tip on your reddit ln bot accou that you to withdraw them fully or them in the real world then you will need a or if you have no tip and to tip then you will need a what's a reddit ln bot accou the clever people who made this tip bot made it so you automatically get a little just for with the bot only attached to your rname that the bot can to track your tip and balance smart what's a lightning a lightning probably an app that you can install the app allows transfer of bitcoin sat to any other s great for buying stuff in

0,catalyst for bitcoin so from what i've gathered there's multiple catalyst for bitcoin price next year despite a looming recession which is a fact at this poi first is the halvening obvious by the end of there should be the peak and preceding that hopefully a long uprd trend tords a minimum of k per bitcoin according to model that have a historical price accuracy of bitcoins value should peak at around m per bitcoin in average recession last for around mohs so by the time this will be over bitcoins price should be around k at the end of next year beginning of second is the gaap accouing standard next year this law will be improved so that company that hold digital asset on their balance sheet will be able to write them at their fair value currely if the price go down in value but jump back up again company have to write down the value of the digital asset and can't mark it up starting from next year it will be differe which apparely ha been a deal breaker for institutional investor in the past third is the capital inflow of traditional investor investme bank pension fund ceral bank small big couries and differe fund currely holding digital asset in their portfolio is considered to be risky due to the absence of regulation transparency public disclosings from the beginning of next year january the united state congress will be having a session where the sec and congress will both fight over which eity get to set the rule they both seem to be in a hurry to be the first s which is a positive for crypto investor a the institution feel safer to invest the capital inflow should be somewhere around trillion usd for the price to reach k at the end of next year curre price would have to quadruple so approximately trillion usd would be sufficie total amou of asset held by mutual fund in the u is trillion usd germany ha trillion and uk brazil and switzerland collectively own trillion usd that's close to trillion if of this would go to bitcoin it price would quadruple another scenario would be where we would consider the multiplier effect x of investing in the stock market in which only billion of capital inflow from institutional investor would be necessary to reach a trillion market cap x billion usd trillion i included switzerland beca it ceral bank ha said it's ierested in acquiring bitcoin there's a few other poteial catalyst in the future that might shape the perception of cryptocurrencies to a positive in the coming year big couries iran russia adopting cryptocurrencies to evade sanction and the pilot of cbdcs also ukraine is of the largest bitcoin holder so there are multiple concrete thing to look forrd to in next year and especially the year after despite the coming recession the biggest factor for a long bear phase are imo rising oil price and ierest rate uil the end of next year in addition to that revolving and non revolving credit are at an all time high while the saving rate of american is at an all time low if the recession will last around mohs it should be a relatively sound timing for the price to shoot up to k per bitcoin during the third picture is metcalf's law which predicts the value to be minimum k by it's not a delicious a the other two model but still dece considering the fact that it would be the minimum value according to this model the value would be minimum m usd during and hover above m uil it reach during next decade these are just some thought thing i've gathered hope some find it ful cheer

0,what's lnurl and bolt a you might the lightning network started back in march and serf a payme layer to scale the transaction speed of the bitcoin network and reduce the cost per transaction at the same time due to the lack of liquidity it s really hard to actually send paymes at the beginning while it became easier to participate in the network there are still challenge to solve in order to make it accessible for the broader mass of the main problem is the need to create an invoice each time you to receive a payme from a ux perspective this is absolutely horrible lnurl and bolt try to solve some of these issue which i will try to explain in the following part lnurl what ectly is that lnurl is a stack of simple protocol for coordinating information needed to make paymes over the lightning network using the full list of lnurl protocol piece can be found here but i'm just going to go io a few core s that overlap with bolt the three core feature of the lnurl protocol are defined a lnurl auth where a public key can be d to log in to a service lnurl pay where a can ping a server through a static qr code and retrieve an invoice lnurl withdraw where a can ping a server and request that the server pay an invoice provided by the for using the autheication protocol the server provides a randomly generated number which the r's sign with a newly generated key after the server retrieves the signed randomly generated number the key get saved and can be d for future logins the invoice request functionality is a y to provide information to a r about a payme they wish to make in a format that is not an invoice this provides a description of the payme the minimum and maximum amou the service expects to be paid and a url for the from which to request an actual invoice from here the display this information to the r allowing them to set a final amou and request an invoice after sending the invoice request and receiving back from the server the verifies that the amous match what the r set and pay the invoice note this feature is already available if you're using phoenix of satoshi or blue muun doe not support it a of now december the withdral request work by pinging the service and receiving in response a description a url to send an invoice to a random string and a minimum amou and maximum amou that can be withdrawn after filling in the appropriate value the return an invoice to the server and if it is valid and within the amou parameter the service pay the invoice the lnurl autheicate protocol can be d in addition to this to ensure that only the iended r can successfully withdraw using the lnurl link common case would be if you to withdraw your sat from a lightning service such a the lipbot here on reddit or the lot on telegram bolt why do we need it the term bolt is the acronym for b asis o f l ightning t echnology you can compare these to the bips bitcoin improveme proposal which are design documes for iroducing feature or information to bitcoin the bip a amended ha since become the standard y of formally communicating idea about poteial bitcoin improvemes a meid at the beginning of this post there are some ux flaw which need to be addressed to understand the problem bolt attempt to solve it is mandatory to have a look at the curre standard which is d to create invoice bolt invoice generated by the bolt standard consist of three main comp the destination where the payme is supposed to be se to public key of the node the amou which is about to be transferred a hash which represes the payme secret the main problem of bolt invoice is that they can only be d once and therefore need to be created in realtime the creation of the invoice lead to the publishing of the payme secret and is therefore unsecure if you would create an invoice with the same secret some could fraudulely request my due to the fact that the secret is n this make the usage of qr code invoice for ations or other case impossible what is bolt bolt offer an attempt to achieve some of the core functionality that lnurl provides without requiring the of a web server an offer encodes the data necessary to reach a node to request an invoice to make a payme either a node _id or a blinded path the last few hop in an onion route pre computed and encrypted to that node using onion message it also can encode a minimum amou for a payme the currency being paid in an expiry time and minimum maximum quaity number for purchasing multiple item this is all of the information necessary to fetch an actual invoice from the node that issued the offer some who s to pay an invoice doe so over onion message of the core feature of bolt it allows node to make a direct end to end encrypted connection between each other that doe not involve a lightning channel just lightning paymes these can be d to onion route message after obtaining an offer a payer will the information encoded in it to send an invoice _request message the creator of the offer will then respond back with an actual invoice there is also support for generating unique per r offer that allow the receiver to request a payme from the creator of the offer similar to lnurl's withdral request feature bolt invoice commit to a unique payer key this can be d in the case of issuing refund to prove you are the person who actually paid the invoice this can also be d in combination with the withdral offer to guaraee that only the correct person can succeed in getting an invoice paid by the creator a opposed to whoever is able to get a copy of the offer what's best both lnurl and bolt enable a more r friendly y for paying or getting paid on the lightning network while lnurl sits on the application level bolt provides a solution on proctocol level where the new offer do neither require a web server tl certificate nor a domain and provide a higher level of protection than lnurl using blinded path the bolt offer allow the confideiality of the node id which additionally enriches the privacy it's importa to say both solution can exist simultaneously while online shop and other service provider operate a web server anyy lnurl is a good add on bolt mostly

0,bitcoin security budget hi all any here is a bit worried about the bitcoin security budget i am a bitcoin lover and i feel it ha the poteial to change the world economy and society anyy recely i heard about the risk that could happen in the future about bitcoin stability it is an issue linked to the miner and their profit right now they get btc per block plus the transaction fee wich is something btc next halving should not be a problem since it will be btc and so the halving after with a rerd of btc miner right now can easily pay off the electricity and hardre to mine bitcoin and they will do it without any problem in the coming year with profit but what about in the next or year you would answer that the price of btc would be so high that even the smallest amou of satoshi could be enough for the miner to do their job but we t that for sure 't we plus bitcoin is influenced by the nasdaq and sp and by the governme and ceral bank decision and ultimately by the world economy and it stability imagine a period of a big recession statistically ly to happen in the next decade what happens if the price of btc drop below the minum price which will make miner stop doing their job since they get le and le btc every year that minimum price is going to raise i'm sorry for my english i'm italian btw i 't to fud this thread i just you to explain to me why i can stay relaxed and keep to stack satoshi

0,how i think i know bitcoin will at some point gain mass adoption there is distinguish characteristic i believe that every non bitcoiner posse and that is a lack of a deep dive io bitcoin ill informed parroting surface level detraction of bitcoin the asset and network bitcoiners on the other hand have e the research and to a certain degree understand the poteial of bitcoinam i wrong have any of you had a real discussion with a non bitcoiner where you can tell they have researched bitcoin in depth they have resarched it and say i this ha no chance of gaining mass adoption becuase that's the conclusion you must come to to not own some bitcoin the value of bitcoin if mass adoption were to happen would be massive so even if there is an infinitesimal chance mass adoption will occur you would still logically own some bitcoin to not own bitcoin you need more than reasonable doubt that it won't work if there is any reasonable doubt than you got to own at least a little bitcoin to me and this could be wrong and more a reflection of confirmation bias but the well informed i would assume would be right more often than those who 't even take the time to understand a topic

0,impact of more halvings i seem to remember every halving being approached with some trepidation a to how the miner would adapt historically price go up and more hash power get turned on can this happen another time in my simple understanding each halving will double the cost of production for most commodity the price will reach equilibrium near the cost or production assuming more halvings assuming a curre cost of about per btc which i is a low estimate this put the bitcoin cost of production at x or over t per btc in this seems kind of absurd especially since it assumes the difficulty and hash rate stay consta to what they are today in given the trajectory of hash rate it should be safe to assume the difficulty will be much higher in than in this would mean the cost of production is even higher than t and the market price would need to be higher than t btc to support this that would put the market cap at m x t or quiillion again an absurd number a this is in t odays dollar inflation would make this even higher another possibility is that the hash rate reach a maximum and then start to drop off if the difficulty is too high miner will have to drop out of the race and reduce the difficulty and cost to be under the market price this would lead to ceralization or at least a reduction in the number of eities corolling the mining hash rate i understand that at some poi most of the block rerds will be in transaction fee but how doe this impact the overall economics of cost of production the fee are currely running around of the block rerd though when the network is busy it ha spiked to from what i can tell the fee will stay relatively the same in absolute btc earned but the coinbase rerd get reduced with the halvings this seems it would put a cap on cost of mining a block thats something x what it is today so this would put cost of block around m and since that's for btc today that would cap it around m cap to btc more realistic but not sure the math hold up

0,a block reward diminish how will the network be incentivized to remain secure a possibly stupid question about mining inceive and how it relates to future network security if the following are true the overall strenh of the network can be computed in dollar term by determining the cost to acquire of the network hashrate the more costly it is to obtain network hashrate the more secure it is the network hashrate will be proportional roughly to the profitability of mining time some coefficie for how efficie the prese day hardre is eg if btc per day are rerded now then it's worth investing x per th s on mining equipme then in the future a block rerds approach zero won't it becoming increasingly le profitable to mine and thus won't network hashrate stall or dip and thus won't it becoming increasingly cheap to acquire network hashrate a an extreme emple if the rerd is only btc day mining hardre would become quite cheap and it'd be easy to buy half of the hashrate it seems that in the future a block rerds diminish in order for the network hashrate to be prohibitively expensive btc would need to have astronomically high price or transaction fee would need to be astronomically high it seems a though through virtue of halving block rerds bitcoin is naturally pushed tords becoming a le secure over time or b expially expensive to both of these tendency would seem to perpetuate a death spiral in the utility a le secure le valuable and b expensive to transact le utility what am i missing a this relates to ceralization of mining here's another aside seemingly bitmain could right now probably single handedly manufacture enough hashrate to own the network in relatively short order they are more inceivized to sell hardre for now however in the future when mining hardre is unable to be profitably sold beca the block rerds are not valuable it seems a though their inceive could shift tords simply owning the network and cashing out

0,best counterargument available to the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard i'm not sure how ectly i began down this bitcoin austrian economics rabbit hole but about a week ago it led me to two faastic yet very distressing book the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard both written by saifedean ammous i'm kind of assuming that these book are well n amongst the bitcoin community i apologize if that's not actually the case the gist is basically fiat my trash bitcoin hard my good although it obviously go io a lot more depth than that frankly i have felt very out of my depth reading these book and trying to about economics this past week or so i am able to read the argumes preseed and find them compelling and see the logic in them but i am left somewhat frazzled by them i 't what to make of them ammous doe a good job of putting thing simply for a bitcoin neophyte myself but for some reason i still struggle to fully comprehend everything i find nothing wrong with ammous' core argumes and hstly i'm kind of alarmed by that is this every's response to reading these book what do mainstream economist who read them have to say about them for me to be okay he's right and go about my life i have to pretty much every in governme is clueless which isn't that crazy i suppose but i still feel a need to seek out some sort of couerargume to these book before i make that conclusion anyys i've been looking with not much success for some sort of response from the mainstream pov to the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard preferably preseing couerargumes to ammous' various poi any suggestion

0,the use for bitcoin mining in stabilizing energy market is very interesting what we are beginning to see with energy production in place kazakhstan and te is using bitcoin mining a a sort of financial battery to store the value of produced energy digitally and then to this value to trade between energy producer based on need this will make energy market more efficie and make energy grid more resilie you can produce at below peak time and then buy at peak time with the bitcoin mined at other time you can produce a sellable asset with ste energy and energy resource to offset the cost of production this is faastic but a le talked about subseque effect of this that i possibly naively foresee is the increasing competition for energy by consumer v bitcoin miner often the energy producer themselves a time will come if this coinues when an energy producer will ask what's more profitable mining or selling the energy to consumer and when that happens the price of energy will begin to be dictated by the price of bitcoin how much you pay for electricity will be tightly correlated with how much bitcoin can be harvested with that energy and how much in fiat it can be sold for once this happens bitcoin then becomes a sort of de facto reserve currency for bitcoin market the price of energy will become volatile a the price of bitcoin and it would make sense then to price energy directly in bitcoin bitcoin will become the unit of accou in energy market once this happens i expect bitcoin to grow out of just the energy industry a a unit of accou over time and begin to be d a a unit of accou for more and more market since energy cost are so fundameal to the cost of most other thing this phenomenon we are seeing now the of bitcoin mining to extract value from ste energy will directly lead to bitcoin being d a a unit of accou worldwide perhaps i'm missing something but i 't so

0,possibility of 'bad actors' mining btc at a loss i promise this is not fud trying to have an hst discussion here and i the term 'bad actors' very loosely here i just got e tching the latest 'what bitcoin did' podcast and part of it really stuck out in my head why is the btc hash rate at literal all time high when price is so low and miner are reaching a poi where they are not profitable there s meion of 'concern that maybe nation state are starting to turn on machine and mine at whatever it cost to get around sanctions' for emple russia mining with their close to free natural gas so i started to what if this s to actually happen there s some inceive either to simply just mine at a loss to get any amou of btc or to possibly attempt to attack the network could be for many reason to flat out mine at a loss this would lead to hst mining company turning off their machine beca it s not profitable to run them differe place pay differe energy cost so obviously this would impact some couries more than others i assume maybe wrongly that the u would be the first to be non profitable should the hash rate coinue to climb while btc price coinues to fall i at least i thought a lot of the design of bitcoin is based on game theory that miner will coinue to join the network a adoption and price increase what happens to this game theory in this case when a 'bad actor' could possibly have close to free energy what would happen in this scenario when some eity is mining even if there is no financial inceive to do so would the network difficulty drop enough for 'hst' miner to keep mining to secure the network in this case i assume place kazakhstan have very cheap energy that would allow hst miner there to coinue to mine well after place the u have turned off their miner how would this realistically play out

0,a question around the future of self custody hey y'all long time lurker around these and other crypto related part of reddit i figured this would be the best community to ask an hst question i have regarding self custody and it idealized future with the rece collapse of ftx the greater crypto community ha been beating the drum of returning to the fundameals and the importance of not your key not your crypto i s listening to an ierview on the breakdown with jesse powell of kraken this evening and he seemed to imply that the idea of keeping cash in a shoebox under your bed s some sort of perfect model for how people kept my in the past he s drawing the comparison to keeping cash under your bed in a shoebox in the old day and it felt he s romaicizing it the implication is that keeping your crypto in cold storage on a hardre is what every should be doing i do this i've e this since i understood the importance of it when i first got io crypto in early i i'm a baby i sn't affected at all by the collapse of ftx even though i'd purchased from them in the past self custody make sense to me it's certainly of the value i ideify with and understand a importa to the space simply put we 't some ceralized organization able to freeze our asset corol how we spend our my or in anyy affect our decision surrounding it with all that being said here's my question if the idealized future of self custody is realized how doe that look for the normal person and will it ever include the same convenience assurance that large ceralized bank offer the idea of keeping cash under my bed is frankly ridiculous there's so many thing that can go wrong my ho could be broken io and my shoebox taken i could lose the shoebox the shoebox could be taken by a family member if i ever to spend that my i have to go home and physically get the cash to spend it somewhere the list go on virtually all the same problem exist today with cryptocurrency but to some degree they're even worse to spend some of my crypto i'd better have my physical hardre on me or i'd at least better have transferred some of it to a location that i can access it from the iernet what happens if my ho burn down maybe i stored my seed phrase in another location but that's kind of a lot to ask isn't it what happens if my hardre malfunction what happens if the company that owns the hardre push a bad firmre softre update sure i can alys restore that with my seed phrase but holy shit what a painful process not to meion the learning curve on all of it is certainly non trivial i'm a softre engineer a lot of the ieractions iuitively make some sense to me i won't get too much io how the expectation of asking some non technical year old person is fairly ridiculous i imagine a lot of that will be ird out over the year a we find a more seamless y to set s up and ieract with them i my question to focus around is there a world where self custody is ever a convenie a trusting some ceralized agency with a massive infrastructure and the motivation for people to spend my is convenience and to a certain degree security fraud protection insurance etc simply a trade off of having direct corol over your my or doe crypto have some long term solution for that i'm just too close minded to imagine will i alys have to carry my hardre around with me just curious to hear from others thanks

1,crypto tax are eth gas fee taxable here we get query on this subject all the time so i thought i'd clear the air when you dispose of cryptocurrency to pay for a fee you may trigger a capital gain tax c eve on the disposal value of the fee itself depending on your tax jurisdiction of course a a result this capital gain loss is realised on the difference between the acquisition and disposal price of the cryptocurrency before paying for the fee a an emple you purchase eth to for fee at the price of some time later you decide to mi an nft the gas fee for this mi are paid for in eth and you pay a gas fee of eth at the time of the sale the price of eth is now a a result you've actually made a gain on the eth itself which s d a a gas fee the reason why is beca the acquisition value of the eth s and the disposal value of the eth is therefore this will trigger a capital gain eve of for the sale of the eth which s d for gas while this may seem obvious to some you'd be surprised how many people forget to accou for this in their capital gain calculation hope that clarifies thing and feel free to read more on this here

1,the truth about cbdcs design choice by ecb amp fed analysed both are aiming at tight control over account interest and spending a digital prison is being built in the shadow due diligence the truth about cbdcs ominous design revealed a digital prison is being built in the shadow massive overreach of ceral bank undery they are designing a new kind of my allowing them to establish ceralized settleme of all paymes tie digital ideities to all transaction and record them on a ceral bank ledger forever force built in feature such a limit on how much cbdc you can have in your accou negative ierest rate accou charge in line with regulatory objective and cap on conversion and spending create my that is traceable programmable table and subject to the mtary whim of ceral planner st out spending without permission and slowly phase out cash the r on my coinues the aim to replace cash with a system of ceralized corol over all transaction and accou balance this report explains ectly what to expect from ceral bank digital currency cbdcs it look at the possible design option what ceral bank have decided so far and the ly outcome the ugly conclusion is that cbdcs are a new form of currency that allows a small group of unelected people corol over what we can and cannot do with our own my lt what is going on _a lot ha been said and written about cbdcs most s speculation but now evidence emerges of what is being built given that our financial system is complex cannot just click a button and iroduce a cbdc a of now much work ha already been e and much is still to be e this report trace the historical path of the developme of cbdcs we start with looking at what cbdcs are then we look at why we need them a explained by the bank of iernational settlemes bi next we look at how cbdcs are designed a the ceral regulator of ceral bank the bi made an inveory of all the differe design option for cbdcs it also provided an hst accou of the poteial benefit and downside of those choice with this ledge we can analyze the design choice made so far we observe how the european ceral bank ecb is going full steam ahead with their cbdc we come to the shocking discovery that the most importa design choice have already been made and that there have even been company hired to start programming next we analyze what is happening in the u the u federal reserve fed is not a far advanced with their cbdc a the ecb however their frank report reveals that their cbdc design choice result in similar corol mechanism a that of the ecb and it even expose possible sinister motif to put it bluly what ceral bank are choosing for design so far tell u all we need to about where this is heading authority are downplaying what is going on and pretending that all is open for debate and subjected to the democratic process but the design they are secretly pushing forrd open the door to the dystopian future we all fear lt what are ceral bank digital currency _before we can coinue we have to define cbdcs after all we already have digital my but cbdcs and what we currely a digital my are very differe thing what we currely refer to a digital my is not issued by the ceral bank in the modern financial system the ceral bank only creates my in the form of cash bill and coin and cash deposit with bank all other my is created by private bank that s right the digital my currely in is created by private institution the digital unit in your bank accou are issued by a private bank cbdcs on the corary are digital public my issued by the ceral bank cbdcs are a totally new kind of my with many new feature to summarize we go from two type to three type of retail my cash public my curre digital my private my curre cbdc public my new source ecb digital euro our future my note that cbdcs are esseially just differe form of the same currency unit of cash is on par with unit of cbdc they are ierchangeable for reason explained later these form of my are also iended to exist alongside each other for the foreseeable future to summarize ceral bank are issuing a new version of my which is a liability of the ceral bank a such cbdcs are not just another form of digital my a public my they are more comparable to the other form of public my cash this begs the question why do we need an addition replaceme for cash lt why do we need cbdcs according to ceral bank _there is much debate on why cbdcs are being rolled out to avoid speculation we will stick with what the bi ha said about why we need cbdcs this approach help u to understand the decision ceral bank have taken and what the logical outcome will be financial stability and the reduced role of public myover the past few year cash ha become le popular this preses a problem beca a shown cash is currely the only form of public my d by the public retail and so when cash is phased out so is public my a principal concern of ceral bank is that if in the future cash were no longer widely accepted or available a severe financial crisis in the private financial system might create further havoc by disrupting day to day business and retail transaction cbdcs would be a y to keep the economy functioning mtary policyanother benefit of cbdcs touted by the bi is that they allow for a more direct influence on mtary policy argumes for issuing a cbdc include poteial strenhening of the pas through of the policy rate to my market and deposit rate and helping to alleviate the zero or effective lower bound constrai the bi also argues for direct stimulus let s take a look at each benefit strenhening of the pas through of the policy rate mean more corol over the ierest rate charged throughout the financial system ceral bank wish to bypass private bank and set rate directly from the mome that hoholds consider a cbdc to be an alternative to commercial bank deposit bank will have le scope for independely setting the ierest rate on deposit of the general public the zero lower bound describes the limit of negative ierest rate in short in an environme of increasingly lower ierest rate on bank accous people might pull their my out of the bank it is after all better to hold cash than my in an accou that charge deep negative ierest rate to address this issue the imf circulated a paper called breaking through the zero lower bound it explores the idea of having differe ierest rate for differe form of my for emple an additional ierest rate on cash can very easily be charged on private bank through what is n a the cash window at the ceral bank the ceral bank charge the regular bank for the of cash and the bank then charge the r through extra fee on withdrals and deposit this y the of cash can be made more expensive than digital form of my this mechanism can be applied to steer the of differe form of my and even be a stepping st on the road to a cashless society a you ll see later the imf s idea of differe ierest rate for differe kind of my is vigorously embraced by ceral bank for emple the nigerian ceral bank d this idea to restrict cash shortly after iroducing their unpopular cbdc and finally according to the bi cbdcs could facilitate a more direct distribution of fiscal stimulus to those member of the general public who need it this could make such policy more effective than general helicopter my or distribution through the indirect and imperfect banking channel which have been d in the past financial inclusionanother buzzword ceral bank to is financial inclusion with a cbdc every could have access to basic financial service this would be especially ieresting for people not served by the curre financial system which is a situation more prevale outside the developed world but a alys much else in the diversity and inclusion agenda these rosy goal are mostly a facade of the most promine organisation behind financial inclusion is the united nation for whom the financial inclusion agenda allows the unlocking of public and private resource to fund their sustainable developme goal the un in turn coordinate it policy through the better than cash alliance an ngo acting a a fro for the ierests of among others the bill melinda gate foundation citi bank mastercard and visa inc in this light inclusive finance can be seen a the conversion of the unbanked io tax and debt serf who pay transaction fee and serve a collateral for the financial system financial innovatiohe bi is discussing all sort of other feature all made possible by the idea of programmable my a we will see most of this innovation is in the ierests of ceral bank of the promised benefit of cbdcs is that it can make iernational paymes much more efficie and transpare beca these kind of liability are being built from scratch cbdcs are billed a offering a unique opportunity to facilitate easier cross border paymes lt cbdc design choices_before we coinue it is importa to note that there have been few official decision made a to how to move forrd the iroduction of a cbdc requires significa work and ceral bank are moving slowly in order not to break anything in this next section we look at the overview the bi ha made on designing cbdcs lot of research ha been e across academia financial institution and the ceral bank and the bi ha created a nice summary of the design option it also reveals what the benefit and downside of these design choice are with this ledge we can then look at the design decision that have already been made by the ecb and fed and hence conclude what is happening behind the scene token v ideity basedfirst of all a choice ha to be made a to whether the cbdc is to be token based or tied to an ideity through an accou according to the bi it ha to be either or the other source bi quarterly review march a token based system would work other crypto currency those with the private key can spend the my but the drawback according to the bi are severe is the high risk of losing fund if end r fail to keep their private key secret furthermore it would be challenging to design an effective regulatory framework for such a system law enforceme agency would run io difficulty when seeking to ideify claim owner or follow my flow just a with cash or bearer security in addition a token system would nullify the ceral bank objective discussed above the other option is that the and ownership of a cbdc is accessible through an accou tied to an ideity similar to how the curre banking system operates to make this happen the bi call for strong ideities for all accou holder where each individual is tied to ideifier across the eire payme system the disadvaages of an accou based system according to a paper of the bi are that you cannot have anonymity vi a vi the ceral bank and there cannot be private peer to peer transaction without an iermediary a is currely possible with cash see graph source bi committee on paymes and market infrastructure cbdcs direct or indirect liability the next question should people have an accou directly with the ceral bank or through iermediary financial institution here the consideration are not just about what is desirable but also what is practically feasible currely ceral bank simply do not have the infrastructure to hold accous for hundred of million of citizen in addition there are regulatory obligation such a kyc and customer due diligence that ceral bank do not have the infrastructure and mandate for the most logical outcome would be for ceral bank to the existing financial company to roll out cbdcs on a more technical level the question then becomes is the cbdc to be a liability on the balance sheet of the ceral bank or on the balance sheet of a financial iermediary with the latter option the cbdc would be an indirect liability of the ceral bank also n a a syhetic cbdc the bi doe not this idea ceralized v deceralizedanother choice need to be made between using a deceralized settleme system or a ceralized firstly for regulator deceralized doe not mean the same thing a it doe to the industry they see it a a few regulated eities validating the settleme system moreover regular consensus mechanism have too much overhead and are too slow for the large number of transaction needed an issue the bi ha with a deceralized cbdc is that it mean that a deceralized network make adjustmes to the balance sheet of the ceral bank this increase the risk to the system according to the bi programmability of the main question a ceral bank ha to ask itself is whether it is going to create programmable my what is programmable my the u federal reserve provides a good definition a digital form of my and a mechanism for specifying the automated behavior of that my through a computer program this mechanism is termed programmability in this note across the pond in individual couries within the eu the need for programmable my is being debated however a you will see in the following section programmability is an esseial part of cbdcs the ecb ha even already released an api for institution to start programming financial stability requiremesthe fact that cbdcs are going to be exchangeable for digital currency result in some major risk to the financial system after all cbdcs make it easy to pull your my out of a private institution risk and deposit it with the ceral bank no risk if cbdcs could be freely traded the mome rumor spread that a bank is having issue all accou holder will convert their accou balance to cbdcs guaraeed by the ceral bank you could have insta bank run and collapse in the financial system would happen a quickly a they do in the crypto space in addition adding cbdcs increase the total amou of my in circulation creates even more inflation at a time when people are already having problem paying their bill a a result any cbdc need a built in mechanism to limit the amou of total cbdc that can be issued and limit how much can be exchanged for digital currency in short a programmable aspect of the cbdc ha to come io play we will see later how both the ecb and fed are already committed to using financial stability a an exc to take full corol over how cbdcs can be held charged and exchanged mtary policy of the main activity of ceral bank over the last decade ha been trying to manage the economy through mtary policy up uil now these ierveions have not alys been effective in kick starting the economy cbdcs can give the ceral bank when properly designed much more direct tool for implemeing mtary policy privacyprivacy is of the main concern of regulator or at least it is the main concern for their poteial r so this issue ha to be addressed in the design of the coin it is worth noting that privacy mean something differe for ceral banker and for end r in the crypto space it mean that the technology make it impossible for any to track your purchase from the poi of view of ceral bank privacy mean that the organisation monitoring and facilitating your paymes are under constrais a to what they can and have to do with your data moreover ceral bank compare the privacy of cbdcs with data mining private financial service company and with transaction being e on public blockchains they argue that in that light public institution are better at safeguarding privacy for the design of a cbdc a ceral bank ha to make a decision a to what level of privacy a coin will have taking io accou that full privacy is considered incompatible with other policy objective such a kyc and aml compliance a we will see there are strong indication that privacy a it is understood by the crypto industry is not going to be built io the cbdc system ieroperabilityceral bank will have to make certain design choice such a whether foreigner are to be able to hold accous with the ceral bank or if there is to be some sort of exchange facility perhaps similar to what the crypto industry call an atomic sp a coordinated cbdc design effort could take a clean slate perspective and incorporate cross border payme option right from the start private v public chainon a final note investor in existing blockchains such a xlm or xrp have been publicly claiming that cbdcs will be built with their chain a the base layer this is simply not going to happen a previously meid cbdcs are liability on the balance sheet of the ceral bank there is no y that they are going to base this on an existing blockchain beca it would mean they would have to take full corol over the network now that we understand the differe design choice available we can look behind the scene at how ceral bank are applying them starting with the ecb lt the digital euro ecb design choices_to understand the process of the creation of the digital euro we have to recap how the eu work this is well described by todd huizinga a former american diplomat to the eu he explains in detail that the eu is run by elite who wish to create an ever closer union regardless of the desire of the population of individual eu couries a a result the eu ha created a culture where policy are preseed a still being debated and subject to democratic principle whilst in fact behind closed door the direction is being agreed upon in backroom deal the same seems to apply to the eu s cbdc the digital euro the design and building of the digital euro is at an advanced stage while officially nothing ha been decided the reality however is that the issuing of the euro and logically also the design of the digital euro is delegated to the european ceral banking system and a you will see in the remainder of this section the digital euro train left the station a long time ago with funding already secured and company being hired to build the required infrastructure a it stand now legislation is to be finalized in q and only in q will the decision on the digital euro be formally approved note that by then the design will be finished the design choice of the digital euroin the ecb published their report on the digital euro it see the future euro a a safe digital asset with advanced functionality and with profound implication for key area of ceral banking for the broader economic and financial system and ultimately for the life of european citizen the digital euro would be first of all another y to supply euro convertible at par with other form of the euro a digital euro will be a liability of the eurosystem and therefore by definition risk free ceral bank my programmabilitythe digital euro should keep pace with state of the art technology at all time in order to best address the need of the market among required attribute are usability convenience speed cost efficiency and programmability it should be made available through fro end solution throughout the eire euro area and should be ier operable with private payme solution programmability is going to be required for a number of desired feature there are going to be corols on how much my can be exchanged between differe form of the euro differe ierest rate on differe form of the euro and limit on what can hold and or transact in crisis situation there will ly be a maximum amou of cbdc which can be held by person at no additional cost in term of mtary policy the digital euro should be remunerated at ierest rate s that the ceral bank can modify over time and with differe ierest rate applied in differe case to get an idea of how much digital euro each accou owner is allowed to own before being faced with restrictive measure such a negative ierest rate the dutch ceral bank suggests that euro should be enough for most dutch citizen a it represes moh s living expense and a financial buffer for unforeseen expense next to the accou feature there is work being e on special payme instruction such a paymes e between machine in short the digital euro is going to be programmable and not in a y that improves financial freedom accou based access and the digital ideitythe bi report taught u that ceral bank can issue a token or an accou based system the ecb indeed discus both a possible option a pure bearer token system a exemplified by regular crypto currency would take ay the corol of the ecb thus according to the ecb such a system can only be allowed when both r are uniquely ideified for emple with biometrics e g fingerpri and iris recognition the accou based system on the other hand would be operated in the same y a the curre banking system this is the preferred system of the ecb where they operate the back end while existing supervised iermediaries operate the fro end a we see shortly financial service provider have already been hired to build this system a we speak the infrastructure for the digital euro is being built along with an eu wide digital id this digital id governed by the eidas regulation aim to help business citizen and public authority carry out electronic ieractions this digital id will coain your releva data such a name address biometrics driver s licence medical data and will be d to facilitate transaction open bank accous online shopping financial service such a insurance and god s what else this digital id s approved in early december but the cbdc s already being built and funded long before that ceral or deceralized corolthe ecb s report repeat the bi s option of having a deceralized settleme system however the ecb is not going for this model they state that the ceral bank will corol the back end and ha corol over all the unit that are to be created other possible featuresother design option are discussed such a the possibility for hardre wearable virtual card with additional feature such a shorter expiration date and spending limit and a pan european mercha solution privacy only for low value transaction the above stateme is from a more rece letter by fabio panetta the driving force behind the digital euro according to him the ecb will explore if they can allow some anonymity in the system the ecb is addressing privacy in response to a public consultation where the ecb asked european citizen what they thought of a european cbdc it received an avalanche of negative response and privacy s the most cited worry but the statemes of the ecb on privacy are coradictory in public official tout it a an importa feature but if you then look at their most rece iernal preseation on privacy they explain that r anonymity is not a desirable feature a this would make it impossible to corol the amou in circulation and to preve my laundering the truth is that a gradual shift to digital paymes implies le privacy by default the ecb suggests that the digital euro should be designed so that the eurosystem should only be able to see the minimum transaction data however they are settling the transaction and will need to who is paying what to whom it is quite clear that privacy is not built io the system the ecb suggests that some privacy can be allowed for certain low value paymes and offline functionality however higher value transaction would remain subject to standard corols lt programming the european cbdc ecb softre package_on the th of december the ecb published a package for financial iermediaries to start building application for the digital euro the publication coained cover letter confirming the design choice discussed above but also a softre package with the application programming ierface api a set of defined rule that explain how the computer of bank are to communicate with those of the ceral bank source ecb website digital euro api package this package provides a programming standard for bank and payme provider that serve the general public it allow them to process paymes digitally while the eurosystem settle the paymes the ecb is testing a system where iermediaries get to program differe kind of transaction five company have been selected to build softre iegrations on a settleme layer hosted by the ecb each will test a differe type of transaction a an annex to the article can download the code of the actual api from the source code a number of additional conclusion can be drawn about the model currely being pursued the digital euro will have iermediaries deal with clies and the ecb ultimately settling all the transaction the iermediary creates the payme the eurosystem approves and then a callback confirms the detail of the transaction with detail on the time and date it settled despite the non stop bashing of bitcoin by the ecb the curre proposal s the same technology utxo pub private signature and even the same security model secpk a bitcoin the ecb is literally creating a bitcoin rip off and may even be re using open source bitcoin code the ecb will respond to every payme request with either settled or failed meaning that it ha the ultimate corol over what paymes do and do not get approval it is unclear what condition would result in a failed payme given the large number of transaction the ecb will have to process and the risk of running complex softre at a settleme layer it is hard to imagine the ecb programming payme condition for specific case however running a payme through a sanction list or a list with basic condition might be feasible moreover it seems ly that programming feature will be enforced at the layer above the settleme layer for emple the ecb is working on a dedicated programmability platform layer between the settleme layer and the iermediary layer source ecb programmable paymes in digital euro the documeation explains how iermediaries create address on behalf of their clies it is only this address the ecb see the more sensitive accou detail are kept with the financial service provider this is explained a safeguarding privacy however a permane record of all transaction is stored all the ecb need to do is match a name to each address and it see everything it is a of yet unclear how mtary and financial stability objective are going to be coded io this system it also is not clear how the ecb aim to reconcile the coradiction of limit on accou balance and their privacy goal the latest ecb progress update doe not alleviate these worry it state that for online paymes the eurosystem itself will record transaction and perform associated verification task and it happens to be that online paymes are the category of paymes with the broadest set of high level case now ask yourself how large a share of paymes in a digital currency will be e online in any case it is safe to assume there is not going to be real privacy in this system beca with this design either the ceral bank or the iermediary s the ideity of the r behind each transaction u federal reserve design of the digital dollar_compared to the ecb the american ceral bank the federal reserve is not a far advanced with designing their cbdc however in january the fed did release their report my and paymes the u s dollar in the age of digital transformation in the opening paragraph the fed repeat the familiar take that cbdcs are a differe kind of my compared to existing form and state that in their opinion a cbdc is a digital liability of the federal reserve that is widely available to the general public it would be the safest digital asset available to the general public with no associated credit or liquidity risk the report poi to the fact that the federal reserve act doe not allow direct federal reserve accous for individual the fed will therefore have to adopt an iermediary model where the private sector would offer accous or digital s to facilitate the manageme of cbdc holding and paymes just a with the ecb you will not have an accou directly with the fed but although commercial bank and non bank would offer these service to individual the cbdc itself would be a liability of the federal reserve further on the fed argues that a future cbdc should be iermediated widely transferable and ideity verified while at the same time being privacy protected these are again coradicting objective a a case the fed note that governmes could a cbdc to collect tax or make benefit paymes directly to citizen additionally a cbdc could poteially be programmed to for emple deliver paymes at certain time again programmable my additionally a cbdc could poteially be d to carry out micro paymes and streamline cross border paymes by using new technology crucially the fed recap the risk unlimited of cbdcs pose to the stability of the financial system a such the fed also proposes the variation of ierest rate on differe kind of my and limit on the amou an end r could hold moreover to preve a flight to safety it proposes limit to the amou a r could accumulate in a short period of time and last but not least the fed discus it mtary policy and the need to expand it balance sheet to accommodate cbdc growth part of this could be mitigated by shifting ay from existing non reserve liability yes the fed is suggesting withdrawing cash to make room for cbdcs new york fed testing of wholesale cbdcsthere were a number of rece headline reporting that the new york fed had started a week test of their first cdbc however this project is mostly about exploring the concept of a wholesale cbdc this is a form of cbdc that is only d to settle the liability of regulated financial institution although ieresting it doe not tell u much about the future of retail cbdcs which are the main subject of this report fednow payme systemfednow is another project under developme by the fed that is sometimes confd with a cbdc this facility will enable individual and business to send insta paymes between accous while the idea of insta settleme reminds u of crypto currency what is settled are not ceral bank liability a such fednow is not a cbdc system lt conclusion the cbdc prison being built_ceral bank around the world have started building cbdcs these need to be designed and each design ha consequence when looking at the design choice made so far we can see where thing are headed and it doesn t look good a of now no formal decision have been made in the jurisdiction discussed regardless the eu s direction seems clear perhaps the u congress still ha a say in the future of my we shall see what we see in the work is a system where small group of unelected people get to approve all paymes there will be no privacy it ha purposefully designed feature that corol how much my you can hold and what kind of charge and negative ierest rate apply a system of consta surveillance and the ceralization of sensitive information and then we haven t even talked about all the other policy increasingly being enforced through the financial system such a a personal co budget or other social credit system the re directing of private resource tords public policy goal blended finance and the exclusion of political undesirable cbdcs replace cash with a kind of my you never legally own you can directly be charged ierest and fee on and cannot spend without permission do you this source this post is larger than character so i removed the footnote from this post full list of footnote can be found here download this article in pdffor a pdf version of this article to store or share click tldr cbdcs are liability directly with the ceral bank they are a new kind of my next to cash and digital my currely held in private bank the bank of iernational settlemes made an overview of all research io cbdcs it show that each design ha consequence the ecb ha chose for a design where iermediaries deal with the clies but the ecb settle all paymes there is no real privacy in the system to ensure financial stability the ecb wish to maiain corol over accou balance apply variable ierest charge and mtary policy stimulus the digital euro is in a far stage of developme the federal reserve act force the fed to go through iermediaries a well the digital usd will be programmable and ideity verified to ensure financial stability the fed wish to maiain corols on ierest charge and maximum accou balance the fed also argues that cbdcs might have to replace cash to maiain a healthy balance sheet the digital usd appears to not be in a far stage of developme

1,a piggy bank with stablecoins in ethereum using multi signature wallet hi i have this particular case and would to share it so people can recommend any solution besides building the solution myself so here it is i to keep some usdc or busd under a multi sign which requires signature to spend the fund of signature but i can see a couple of issue with only having party and needing signature to perform anything with any fund in that multi sign first death second separation of the party involved and a need to return fund to each party death if of the two party dy during the duration of this trust of fund the remaining party need to go through and recover the other party's to do anything with the fund which is an annoyance at best separation let's say any of the involved party to stop putting my io this trust fund again is that the name of this thing and leave with their corresponding share of the my but the other party doesn't to sign anything which freeze the fund uil the dispute is settled and worst case scenario n of the party doe what the other part asks and a judge get involved to resolve the conflict then some solution come to mind solving both particular edge case at the same time involving a third party that play the role of arbitrator it could be a lawyer who represes both party but these cost my and you need to trust the lawyer to do the right thing to me what come to mind is a smart coract is cheaper than a lawyer and you can write if you what you are doing to do the right thing but a smart coract can corol of the fund and do whatever n of m signature request right i wonder if a smart coract can be a signer party in a multi sign my reasoning for that is that the n of m smart coract signer corol of the fund if some smarter than the person writing the coract to exploit a bug the attacker won't get anything of value beca he still need other signer to participate in the hack of the signer in this case okay so the question is there something this out there in ethereum that can be d for cheap and with a froend that won't banish suddenly or do i need to build it myself

1,how eips are approved on ethereum a simple explanation an eip can be submitted by any and becomes the responsibility of the author once they re created the author informs other developer of their proposal gather support to build and launch it and documes work throughout the process the majority of eips are standard track eips proposal that change the ethereum protocol itself broadly anything that technically change ethereum is a standard track eip there are several sub type under the standard track core network ierface erc core eips core eips are change drastic enough to require a fork in the blockchain fork are when the blockchain split in two beca of a major decision with path following the old rule and the new path following the new s networking eips networking eips are improvemes to node communication and transaction are transmitted on ethereum transaction are encrypted when se when i send you fund i'm encrypting a message that only you can decrypt change to these aspect are networking eips ierface eips ierface eips are improvemes for how application ieract with ethereum they standardize the api d for communication with the blockchain an emple is eip which changed an opcode on ethereum from suicide to self destruct for meal health reason erc eipsfinally erc eips establish new standard on ethereum often for smart coracts these standard are responsible for token on ethereum erc and non fungible token erc and many more without these standard token wouldn t be easily tradeable additional eip typesstandard track eips the s listed above are the most common the le freque meta eip cover non technical change in process how developme overall is managed finally instead of proposing new feature informational eips elaborate on existing design detail the eip approval process eip eips can be proposed by any but often require the work of multiple people depending on their impact eip editor review eips that are submitted and multiple developer are usually required to build a feature the effort to rerd ratio factor greatly io which proposal are prioritized and which aren t they all follow an ideical process that determines which eips get delivered first before submitting an eip author should first vet the idea with others in the ethereum developme community assuming the idea is not covered by an existing eip the author creates a draft and submits it to the eip editor there are differe eip editor responsible for each sub type of eip they re responsible for making sure the proposal are technically sound once that s e they create the draft version of the eip once an eip editor feel the draft is ready to receive feedback from the community they move it from being in draft to in review at this stage any member of the ethereum developme community can share their thought on how the proposal can be improved once complete the eip eers the last call stage this provides a final opportunity for feedback to be shared usually within day if any major change come up the proposal move back to review if no major feedback arises then the eip move io the final stage once an eip is final it becomes a candidate to include in ethereum s periodic upgrade called fork the process highlight the importance of individual responsibility in a deceralized environme no feature would be delivered if not chid by at least person to start and each is only made complete through the process of peer review may the brightest idea win thank you for reading if you learned something ieresting sign up to my free newsletter below i'll send you email a week with a simple write up on a blockchain topic no ad shill or affiliation stay kind stay curious

1,idea how we could create timelocked transaction backup to recover ether from lost key i have been ing a lot lately about key manageme and fund recovery it occurred to me that we could create a system that allows u to recover fund from lost key by signing time bound transaction which can sweep our fund in the eve that we lose access in a nutshell this work by signing a transaction that deploys a coract which sends fund to another address this could be a friend family member or even your exchange and setting time constrais such a not valid before and or not valid after you can also sign many of these transaction with multiple nonce value so that you still have a valid transaction in the eve that you make future transaction since this signed transaction is constrained to the recipie and certain time criterion it is not sensitive and can be stored anywhere including on the cloud a a r you have the power to invalidate the transaction at anytime by either spending the fund or using up all the nonce i have started creating a prototype here let me what you of the concept and how you would improve it merry christmas

1,a simple explanation of eof evm object format eof is the biggest upgrade in the evm's history coming in the shanghai fork in march eof will completely change how ethereum work here's a summary eip the first upgrade in eof change how instruction to the evm are structured specifically it establishes a structure where didn t really exist before it split bytecode io two string of character coaining code and the other coaining data this eip also make it easier to upgrade the evm it creates a system to distinguish new coracts and what feature each is using the evm executes each program based on the version of the evm it s released in so new upgrade can be delivered more easily eip this iroduces the concept of code validation specifically when a smart coract is deployed coracts today aren t validated by the ethereum network before they re deployed they get validated a they re executed by people validating coracts upon deployme save significaly on execution cost program are validated once upon deployme and any necessary data for operation is made available in the data section of the bytecode eip quick tange stack machine can be imagined a glass coainers tall and thin they execute instruction and store data in these glass coainers the first piece of data is placed at the bottom and everything afterrds get placed on top in a stack stack machine have poiers that can move between piece of data to read them the y ethereum shift it poier today is with a jump which requires a destination or a jumpdest eip 's new opcodes enables the ethereum stack machine to shift it poier far more efficiely this result in cheaper gas fee both for deploying a coract a well a for ieracting with it also make on chain analysis easier eip this iroduces function that the stack itself can perform function are instruction that need to be performed more than once in a program writing such instruction once a a function make program more efficie leading to cost saving on ethereum currely function t exist at the bytecode level that the stack machine executes on ethereum to repeat instruction the jump and jumpdest opcodes are instead d to shift the poier to where an instruction is when it need to be executed eip this eip focs on validating coracts upon deployme but by looking for error the stack machine might encouer called stack overflow or underflows stack overflow when a stack is out of space stack underflow retrieving data from an empty stackdespite stack overflow and underflows being basic error they can occur on ethereum today the check to preve them are iroduced with this eip eof is a suite of eips together making evm execution more efficie more consiste and more easily upgradeable eof itself is first upgrade in the evm's history and can be expected in the shanghai hard fork in march if you'd to learn more read the full write up on my free newsletter below

1,short passage to be explained like am guy i usually get english but this time it all going over my head i what finality mean i both finalisation and justification upgrade but the following did not make sense to me finality requires a two third agreeme that a block is canonical an attacker cannot possibly create an alternative finalized chain without owning or manipulating two third of the total staked ether destroying at least third of the total staked ether the first condition arises beca two third of the staked ether is required to finalize a chain the second condition arises beca if two third of the total stake ha voted in favor of both fork then third must have voted on both double voting is a slashing condition that would be maximally punished and third of the total stake would be destroyed what i understood of total eth staked need to be vote for upgradation of the concerned block the above al and not even the reasoning or how this voting happens if they ask for finalising justifying x block or is all of that e by only asking which chain is the correct latest blockchain state or what ectly is asked can some please simplify this for me i do not understand anything from the second condition paragraph please explain me that paragraph in simple manner

1,smart contract utility explanation this is what some said when i said smart coracts were ful can any debunk it no they are not ful and some of them are so insane that i can't believe anybody who spe more than second ing about them would ever they're ful it even touch on the fatal flaw of smart coacts while falsely claiming they're the solution if there s a dispute between the two party a governmeal third party must get involved in many case this third party will also play a role in the creation of the coract ok so what if there actually is a dispute the coract say x is supposed to happen but enforceme is automatic based on certain condition but what about condition that aren't able to be included in the coract sure re is due on the first but the ter s off for a week and the tena doesn't owe the full amou all coracts for stuff in the real world still have to abide by the legal system which mean ultimately court need to be able to corol what happens even if some absolutely ref to play along imagine you're trying to sell a ho using smart coracts do you even own the ho in the first place just beca you have some token saying you do doesn't mean you actually do if some steal your private key do they now own your ho if the token is not the actual definitive record of ownership and it absolutely should not be then you haven't removed reliance on third party but just added an irreleva not legally binding aspect to the system and of course all of this is assuming that we can make smart coracts perfect without any error code can and will have error and many people have already lost fortune due to poorly written coracts if there's no enforceme system external to the coract it's not usable in the real world if there is an external system then the smart coract is no longer the definitive truth and serf no ful purpose

1,here s an extremely simplified no coder explanation of why not all l are built the same explaining this subject without getting too deep io coding language and technicality is extremely hard to tackle but i ll try my best of course this isn't some sort of guide on how l are built or operate but is merely a fun quick explanation of how some of them are differe i ll be focusing on zkevm compatibility and will be comparing the top ethereum l on the market with zero ledge tech starknet zksync polygon zkevm ethereum standard language solidity solidity solidity solidity transitional language readable cairo llvm ir ir ir bytecode opcode bytecode cairo assembly zinc instruction micro opcode opcode ruime cairo zkevm zinc zkevm zkevm evm a we can see although they all do a great job at scaling ethereum some have a slighter advaage polygon zkevm polygon is currely a type in evm equivalence meaning they built an infrastructure that is compatible with evm at bytecode level this mean polygon s zkevm can achieve compatibility at both the solidity language level and opcode level scroll also ha similar feature but i m not sure if it s bytecode equivale correct me if i m wrong competitor on the other hand are at levelwhile competitor are at type in evm equivalence meaning theywhat it basically mean is that they take a high level coding language vyper or solidity and transpile it down to snark friendly vm language level e g zksync's zinc and starkre's cairo for the average no coder these might seem very slight difference that t make any difference but this couldn t be farther ay from the truth these small difference are being developed to end up achieving full ethereum equivale type evms which is a feat still not achieved by any l

1,staked eth what are your thought on having eth still staked on coinbase should i wrap it and sell it and then buy back io eth and move to my trezor the price difference to wrap and sell plus the fee would be about an automatic loss which i guess really isn't too big of a deal when looking at how far eth ha fallen this year in the bear market still ha held up reasonable well compared to the past should i just forget about the loss to do this and get off the exchange asap it's the only thing left on coinbase besides my little bit of algo which i'm about to move a well

1,is validator uptime actually a vulnerability signal hear me out before burning me at the stake here there are many assumption taken in this post o clies fallback clies etc and even more edge case that refute my thought this post is iended to shed light on a general case that may apply to many validators if not most given it would seem to affect vanilla validator configuration validator uptime is a publicly discernable attribute through missed attestation and a anybody running a validator should critical node maienance security update ofteimes require a system restart that would result in publicly vieble dowime if i s a malicious actor that ed to attempt to gain access to validator key by compromising these node then this uptime metric could provide me a fast and easy short list of validators that ly have not g through this maienance effort i could even rank my list depending on how long the validator ha been online targeting node that poteially have not been restarted in mohs or year with the assumption that security exploit are more effective on these node missing a few attestation is relatively painless from a financial perspective if a node operator is hellbe on not performing maienance on their system for whatever reason would it make sense to pay a few ce each moh and create a script that would cut network activity to the node for a few hour at the end of every moh if it were me i i would pay this low cost to avoid being placed on the malicious actor short list then again if it were me i would just update my node instead

1,is investing in eth better than l like matic i am kind of a noob on this but it look l 's are a temporary solution
1,if i write down my wallet seed key out of order and someone find it can they use automation to find correct order and steal my wallet content let's assume that they 't the system i d to order them are the permutation of order of word further limited by word being a checksum of sort low enough that people could write a program that try all the valid combination if it is easy to do so what further step can i take to further encrypt my written down seed key

1,what do you consider the biggest advantage of ethereum according to coinmarketcap the world now ha nearly cryptocurrencies this make determining which s will be profitable in the long run difficult for investor but my personal favorite is ethereum which is also the second largest cryptocurrency in term of market capitalization there are numerous advaages such a nfts beca ethereum is the major blockchain where most of the top n nonfungible token are launched people are excited about ethereum beca the market for nfts is expected to reach more than billion in sale by with a perce annual growth rate this suggests that ethereum will be in high demand beca it is required to pay fee when producing or purchasing token on deceralized platform opensea nfts can now be d to accomplish a wide range of task a we all nfts offer some people the opportunity to make large sum of my however only some people who deal with them become a millionaire every is unique and every's risk rerd tolerance varies a a result depending on 's perspective nfts can be viewed a either a lottery or an investme in some case regarding nfts in lottery system the lottery industry accous for of global gambling revenue this type of gaming is rumored to be coming soon to platform billionair which is powered by a robust token based economy the airb utility token and nft based ticket these can be d to participate in raffle bet ger on and win the best skill and chance game the crypto scene evolves so quickly there are more and more opportunity for ethereum and nft holder what is the most significa advaage of ethereum in your opinion
1,how safe is my eth on arbitrum looking at how unsafe the wrapped token are sobtc and soeth issue by ceralized eities which just crashed i am wondering how safe are eth on l optimism arbitrum zksync etc and why thanks
1,need advice if anyone know i need worth of eth for gas fee coinbase won't let me send anything out for day metamask all require a ssn for a direct fiat buy which doesn't seem safe to me is there any easy y i can buy eth with fiat that requires little or no kyc
1,i've been wondering how some nfts make money when they sell for a little a and people pay exorbitant fee did you ever about how people decide on nft price or how you price nfts i've been wondering how some nfts make my when they sell for a little a and people pay exorbita fee that's why i've been ing about this question market for nfts began to gain traction in and by the end of march this new market for digital asset had a total lifetime traded volume of approximately million some of the frequely asked question are how doe price their art and what is the best strategy for selling nfts despite the lack of predefined pricing strategy for nonfungible token nft seller may choose to sell them at the listing price in a secondary market alternatively they may complete the sale at a price that a buyer is willing to pay referred to a the buyer price beca of this gaming nfts are the easiest to deal with nfts can be rerded with battle gameplay armor weapon or who s what a in m tournames a you can see i'm more ierested in gaming nfts so i'm not sure how pricing work for differe type of nfts even so i believe that if you set your price too high you risk never being able to sell that item and that if you set your price too low gradually raising it will be more difficult what are your opinion

1,where will sol project go i posting in eth community the obvious answer is this should make project move tord a proven deceralized chain and i that make sense and some will choose eth but they chose sol over eth initially primarily due to cost so will there still be a market for lower cost option albeit with more scrutiny i still believe multiple chain will meet differing need just curious if even a few agree if so who is next up to fill void just to be clear i eth will still dominate market share but curious which chain will have a better share with sol faltering

1,the fictitiousness of the consensus algorithm the failure of decentralization and the emergence of nonblockchain the content is very long pre scrolling is recommended definitiohe blockchain is operated based on a plurality of node configured in a pp method couless transaction are submitted mome by mome from clies all over the world tords couless node spread all over the world the result of these transaction are recorded on all node and in particular the coes should be the same overall in order to realize this the rule that all node must follow is the consensus algorithm to describe it more conceptually it can be defined a a method in which a specific node is selected by a certain rule especially by the deceralization principle the selection and execution order of transaction is determined by the selected node and other good willed node independely verify and execute the coes of individual transaction and store them in their database a such consensus algorithm can be clearly defined however many people are misunderstanding this definition the subject of consensusthere is a serious misunderstanding about it of the general public misunderstands this poi and most of the dapp programmer who have not built the mainnet themselves are misunderstood or ambiguous this is even shown on ethereum's official website there is no understanding of the definition of the consensus algorithm meid above or it is ambiguous the fundameal ca of this problem is the illusion about the subject of consensus in short even though the coe of the transaction that's the autheicity of the author is not a subject of consensus it is often mistaken the only subject of the consensus are the selection of transaction and the order in which they are implemeed a the coes of the transaction ectly the autheicity of the author the transaction that a sends eth to b is electronically signed with a private key and deployed to the blockchain network the autheicity of the transaction creator is judged by each of all pp node it doesn't get help from any outside and it doesn't ask any outside however most ordinary people and surprisingly many dapp programmer mistake the autheicity of the coe or the author's autheicity a the subject of consensus however this is not the subject of consensus but of ai consensus a famous pharase about this is the following do not trust verify a a result even if all other node in ethereum conspired to forge the transaction and store it in the database the hst node doe not care about it at all and verifies the transaction by itself and store it in it own database and new node joining afterrds will follow the hst node b selection and execution order of transactionsthese are the genuine subject of consensus no more no le not all transaction submitted to the blockchain are selected and the selected transaction are not executed in the order in which they are submitted this is beca it is theoretically impossible a long a the concept of a block of finite capacity is premised therefore there arises a problem of deciding how many transaction to accept in block and in what order to execute them it is the problem of the consensus algorithm and in itself this becomes the definition of it i selection of transactionsfor emple assuming that suddenly billion transaction are pushed in second it becomes impossible to put them in block therefore we have no choice but to choose some of them in this case most mainnets collect transaction in the order of high gas price and put them in block therefore even transaction submitted first in time may not be included in the block if the gas price is low they also run later than other transaction with high gas price even if they are coained in block for reference the existing ceralized system solves this problem by creating a queue so even if a billion transaction suddenly hit in a second it can theoretically accept and process the whole transaction ii order of execution of transactionsthis is also usually determined based on gas price maybe all the mainnets are doing that and i've never heard of that exception in this case it is natural that the possibility of manipulation occurs the answer of existing blockchain protocol to this are a follows code is law it mean that you are responsible for not checking the law in advance this is simply an irresponsible attitude for emple if an incompete legislator incorrectly eered the amou of parking fine and added another zero the legislator is not at fault and you are an idiot for not checking the law this is the curre state of the blockchain in the dao crisis the law s eveually forced to be revised now it should be law is code the order of execution of transaction must be in the order in which they were submitted at least they should try to do that however the existing mainstream platform insist that the curre gas price auction system is the right y offering only poor excs of course every s that it is a lazism the birth of the block conceptas described above the curre consensus algorithm have a fundameal problem nevertheless the reason satoshi and buterin adopted this method s to make ceralized manipulation impossible in the selection and execution order of transaction that's they sacrificed the general principle of pre submissionism to pursue deceralization by the y in order to pursue deceralization in the satoshi sense the order of selection and execution of transaction must be determined by a node rather than a specific node however if couless clies submit their transaction to a myriad of node the unity of the overall database will be broken if the transaction are executed in the order submitted for each node therefore he s forced to seek y to select and order transaction by any random node and to allow other node to accept them to this end it is needed to establish rule on who will make decision on selection and who will follow them a selected by a duly elected selection decision maker other node follow it and execute each transaction and store it in their own database thereby maiaining the overall database uniformity it s the pow that satoshi came up with a a y to determine who ha the authority to make the above selection decision that mean that the person who solves the high level math problem the fastest will be given the right to decide on the selection of transaction however in order to do this you need time to solve math problem and during that period the transaction queue is accumulated at this poi satoshi came up with the concept of the very block it is the miner who succeeds in solving the math problem satoshi established a rule that the miner selects all or some of the transaction accumulated during the period of solving mathematical problem put them in block and executes them and all other node follow the rule the block concept of blockchain s born in this coext limitation of the meaning of deceralization in blockchainas such the block concept emerged a a methodical eleme to make it impossible to manipulate in the adoption and order of execution of transaction it s the best y within the limit of satoshi's ielligence the reason satoshi adopted the block concept s of course to achieve the idea of deceralization despite innumerable problem such a the execution delay of transaction during the block generation time the reversal of the transaction execution order and uncertaiy of being selected in the block satoshi believed that deceralization would be guaraeed if a node s selected from among the innumerable good willed node spread around the world and those node determined the selection and execution order of transaction and he thought that if only the deceralization s guaraeed he could endure a number of problem cad by block generation if so it is necessary to calmly emine the advaages of the deceralization compared to the ceralization system at the expense of such considerable cost for this it is good to make a comparison in other word it is assumed that there is ceralized node and that this node determines the selection and execution order of transaction and other node follow suit next the deceralization system is compared with this first there is no difference in the coe of the transaction whether it is a ceralization method or a deceralization method this is beca forgery is impossible thus the transaction in which a transfer bitcoin to b work ectly the same on these two system and is also stored in the database in the same y it is also impossible for the ceralization system operator to produce the above manipulated transaction from the beginning and both system are the same in this respect however there are difference between the two system in the selection of transaction and in determining the order of execution the problem is that it is necessary to emine whether the difference is esseial or relative speaking from the conclusion the difference is only a relative difference and in particular in term of fairness that is preveion of manipulation it can be said that there is nothing better than a ceralized system in a deceralized system let's look at this in detail the manager x of the ceralized system can arbitrarily manipulate the selection and execution order of the first transaction in which a transfer bitcoin to b and the second transaction in which a transfer bitcoin to c so if x hate b love c and a's curre balance is bitcoin x can make the bitcoin which is normal to be transferred to b be transferred to c by manipulating the order of transaction or omitting the first transaction at all satoshi s are of the above problem and a a couermeasure he studied how to empower random node operator to decide the selection and order of execution of transaction the result of the study s mining and the concept that arose a an inevitable result of the mining s the block finally at first it seemed that satoshi's idea could be realized without obstacle if there are innumerable node and an arbitrary or random node operator determines the selection and execution order of the transaction it can be admitted that virtually no can manipulate it however the reality did not go a satoshi thought the first typical situation s the emergence of the mining king in china he s able to exert the power of the operator of a ceralized node to some exte based on the enormous hash power and most of all the critical scene s the dao incide ethereum foundation and a series of sympathizer have artificially manipulated the selection and execution order of the transaction to generate an artificial fork since then couless artificial fork have been implemeed in the blockchain ecosystem a a result satoshi's logic of deceralization ha virtually collapsed a an inevitable result the block concept ha now fallen io a relative rather than an absolute concept in the blockchain in fact even if it s not the chinese mining king or the dao crisis there s alys a possibility of manipulation by arbitrary node operator that is the case when a node operator is preparing to manipulate at that time in case he succeeds in mining if he prepares manipulated code and allows the code to be executed when he succeeds in mining or is selected a a validator he can manipulate them for emple with simple code manipulation it is possible to change the selection and order of execution of transaction in a low rather than high order of gas price a such deceralization through mining and block s originally an incomplete method it s not a digital but an analog concept that is on a differe level from the absolute concept of the impossibility of forgery by electronic signature and this result applies equally to po whether the stake is large or small a node operator can manipulate the selection and execution order of transaction a long a he is selected a a validator but the problem 't end here it's time to ask a more fundameal question is it reasonable to fundameally determine the selection and order of execution of transaction based on gas price to say the conclusion in advance it is a manipulation in itself it's nothing more and nothing le than to benefit some who ha offered more bribe let's look at it in detail in general it is right to execute the transaction received first for emple no matter how much remittance fee are offered to a bank it never change the remittance order beca it is a principle of nature to process remittance in chronological order there is no reason to treat this principle differely in blockchain therefore if the order is to be reversed a corresponding unavoidable reason must be preseed satoshi's answer to this is a follows by extracting transaction in the order of higher gas price the platform can preve infinite repetitive attack this is not a reasonable preseation this is a simple security issue and a topic unrelated to deceralization that's it is not an issue to be considered in the stage of building the core of the blockchain that should be considered once the esseial structure of the blockchain is completed in other word in the core stage it is right to complete the basic structure so that the transaction are executed in chronological order therefore the infinite repetition attack problem should be considered in the process of considering various secondary problem of the basic structure that ha been completed primarily in the process it is the right programming mindset to devise and install a new appropriate additional device separately also such a device is easily conceivable for emple you can find a lot of great method even at the level of common sense such a conducting transaction in chronological order receiving cost in term of security rather than gas and returning them if there are no problem later unfortunately it is assumed that satoshi did not have time to come up with such an idea a a result the gas cost were forcibly inserted io the core part of the blockchain under the wrong name that's the security cost were inserted under the name of gas cost the aftereffect of satoshi's decision on subseque blockchains were severe in conclusion satoshi's deceralized method could not achieve it original purpose the selection and execution order of transaction could be manipulated and more fundameally determining them based on the gas price is just manipulation in itself the gas cost priority policy is an unusual manipulation against the common sense that the transaction received first should be implemeed first and the reason for that manipulation s also poor in conclusion it is inevitable to raise fundameal question about satoshi's deceralization method that is the block method itself this is not just an issue for bitcoin but a problem for ethereum and all other blockchains disappearance of the blockif all transaction can coinue from beginning to end without manipulation and the database can be stored equally on all node the purpose of the blockchain is achieved a curious result emerges here that is the fact that the concept of a block is not necessary to achieve that purpose in addition the fact that n of the existing blockchains achieved the esseial purpose of the blockchains meid above perfectly at least satisfactorily make u surprised that mean that the block is a failed concept a shown by the comparison of the two system above it cannot be guaraeed that the deceralized pp system of satoshi or ethereum ha special advaages over the ceralized pp system instead by adopting a ceralized system but strenhening the device that corol the ceral main node to preve ab of authority it is possible to make a more fair and unmanipulatable system than the existing deceralized system for emple a main node temporarily monopolizes the selection and execution of transaction and is forced to select and execute transaction in chronological order then the other node monitor it constaly and if it operates against principle disqualify it and appoi of the other standby node a the main node in any case both ceralized pp and deceralized pp cannot manipulate the coes of a transaction that's both method already have solved the byzaine general problem the remaining issue are of what to select and how to set execution order but rather a ceralized system can operate them more fairly the transaction submited first is executed first and the gas cost may not be received at last we come to a final conclusion the concept of the block is removed a long a the transaction are executed in the order submitted there is no reason to divide and put them in block this is no differe from executing transaction in chronological order received by bank or credit card company they no longer need the concept of block the concept of the block s only satoshi's desperate measure and it is by no mean a logically necessary concept to achieve the purpose of the block chain and the most importa fact is that it is desirable to remove the concept of a block a much a possible therefore it come to the conclusion that the block concept will eveually disappear the only thing that remains is the transaction chain now the blockchain must be renamed the transaction chain which will revolutionize the blockchain ecosystem the appearance of nonblockchainat least it is possible to remove the concept of block while maiaining the curre level of fairness of deceralization in bitcoin or ethereum more precisely it mean that there are theoretically infinite y to eliminate the concept of the block to improve the selection and execution order of transaction while securing fairness beyond the curre level of the fairness of deceralization in bitcoin or ethereum then what will the consensus algorithm look if the block concept is actually removed first of all the chain is made up of only transaction this transaction chain also ha no fear of forgery at least in the coe of the transaction a long a pp is the premise there is no fear of forgery or falsification of the coes of a transaction whether it is on a ceralized or deceralized system if so the only thing left is the selection and order of transaction who will decide them this mean going back to the poi when satoshi created bitcoin based on experience over the past year satoshi ha failed on this issue for now therefore we must return to satoshi's initial starting poi even if we 't that and we have to start over from scratch what need to be observed here is thing and that is enough that's the level of fairness must be above the curre level of bitcoin or ethereum complete fairness is impossible it's not impossible in theory but it's practically impossible unless an innovative new technology rsa emerges the easiest thing to about is appoiing a main node in appoiing the main node the status may be endowed permanely or only temporarily the most appropriate answer will be somewhere in the middle of the two it is virtually impossible to appoi and replace the main node only temporarily i e only once for each transaction satoshi s confroed with this very problem at that time satoshi imagined the concept of block and from this blockchain s born and year later it s confirmed that the concept of block s a failure in this case the most common sense that can be thought of is to appoi a main node under a certain standard and constaly monitor it a a method you may the platform's own code or you may a smartcoract and if manipulation or laziness of the main node is detected a method of replacing the main node automatically or by poll is iroduced even at this level the fairness is not inferior to the former chinese mining king or specific foundation led artificial fork creation above all this method ha the advaage of being able to set the operating standard in advance in a smartcoract a a result arbitrary fork generation is fundameally blocked this is beca the fork generation principle itself that other node follow the longest blockchain ha been removed then it can be said that it is relatively more fair than the existing deceralization system in the end that can be called proof of democracy pod deceralization which is le fair than pod is no longer deceralized eveually the religion of deceralization also collapse many people still believe in this myth it is superstition beca there is no technical basis the trustlessness ha a technical basis called a electronic signature however there is no such definite technique for the permissionlessness an esseial eleme of deceralization a demonstrated above the block failed the deceralization ha failed in both theoretical and practical y therefore in this situation calling for deceralization is nothing more than calling for it a a simple ideology it is no more than a cry for th ceury anarchism deceralization without technical support is nothing more than a mere cry of ideology in reality pow and po are also fundameally operated under the corol of pod they are no longer deceralized thing let's look more specifically pow is not a mining certification method but a mining manipulation method a can be seen from china's mining king po is also only a method that can be manipulated by stakeholder there is currely no technology or method to preve the manipulation the dao crisis and the numerous fork that have been conveniely attempted since then only prove that the blockchain is accepting democracy it ultimate bastion that is it may be seen that the pow or po is only a kind of pod at prese in other word all existing consensus algorithm are pod pure deceralization independe of democracy doe not currely exist therefore the method of selection and ordering of transaction can only be explored based on pod at prese advaages of nonblockchain satoshi's block ended in failure however it ha since become the standard for all blockchains most blockchains fundameally do not deviate from satoshi's basic framework eveually all of them disappear or remain only for mum personally bitcoin's block will survive forever on the other hand ethereum is very unstable there is absolutely no reason to maiain the block concept in the ethereum c ethereum's attempt to maiain the curre block concept is an obvious long term impossibility nonblockchain ha many advaages once you can stick to the principle that is transaction may be executed in the order of reception or submission a in the previous emple if the tree method with the main node a the top is applied transaction can be executed in the order received by the main node furthermore all transaction can be accepted without omission this is the same a the queue concept in a general computer o there is nothing special the nonblockchain would normally adopt a tree structure of course in preliminary the horizoal pp method of the curre blockchain may be adopted a an auxiliary method it depends on the mainnet developer's choice anyy if the tree structure is adopted it can boast the fastest speed theoretically there can no longer be a rapid structure the nonblockchain doe not require a concept such a gas price to determine eligibility to be included in a block beca the concept of a block doe not exist in the first place it is enough to accept and impleme in fact the gas cost of existing blockchains are virtually irreleva to the node's operating cost this is beca the execution of transaction and the storage of data are performed in all node but the gas cost are only probabilistically paid to miner or validators to be ect gas cost should be distributed fairly to all node in this respect the existing gas cost system is extremely unreasonable instead it is desirable to institutionalize a separate method of payme of operating expense newly and that is possible but that will not be specifically meid here the real purpose of existing blockchains collecting gas cost is not for operating expense the mining rerds are sufficie to pay operating expense in fact the real purpose of the gas cost s security cost this is being confessed by ethereum's official site in short gas fee help keep the ethereum network secure by requiring a fee for every computation executed on the network we preve bad actor from spamming the network the nonblockchain collect security cost not gas cost if malicious ie is not positively recognized due to the review the collected gas cost will be returned in this y the security cost may be set high enough without resistance eveually by returning the gas cost they become zero a described above the advaages of the nonblockchain are considerable and there are no theoretical or practical obstacle to it adoption so of course the existing block concept must be discarded and a system consisting only of a pure transaction chain will inevitably emerge the nonblockchain consensus algorithm is bound to be pod for the time being for now we have no choice but to it for the emergence of consensus algorithm that can achieve deceralization in the true sense by a genius who will appear someday uil then it will only be in the form of a pod conclusiohe block s just satoshi's impromptu idea the necessity for hash to be coiguous is only between transaction not between block a a result the name of the blockchain itself is meaningless the blockchain is only method proposed by satoshi to realize the ideology of the transactionchain the block is not the truth the block concept s only of the myriad y to realize the transactionchain and it ha now reached the poi of disposal the byzaine general problem s not solved by satoshi but s just a problem that had already been solved by cryptography it s the electronic signature looking inside the blockchain at the curre stage there are no particularly remarkable technology other than the electronic signature other technology are only those that have already existed or can be developed by ordinary programmer it is absurd to try to achieve deceralization with only such poor equipme in other word the crypto world at this stage doe not have the ability to realize the ideal of blockchain a an inevitable result the consensus algorithm cannot go beyond pod this is the reality of today's blockchain but the spirit of commercialism s to hide these limitation on the other hand glorify the block to this end they feature the emperor's new clothes the represeative clothes are ethereum's future plan the complexity of this plan is indescribable the complexity s all cad by the concept of the block these are temporary complication that will all disappear when the block concept is removed or at least a fundameal platform that heals the problem appears for the time being of course they are successful in dazzling people
1,a lesson from ftx it seems the biggest takeay after ftx ha been revealed to be insolve is that cold storage is the only y to go however i believe most people are overlooking the biggest poteial concern that can be drawn from it there were gia ceralized exchange in cryptocurrency binance coinbase and ftx of them is now on the brink of bankruptcy there is a huge danger in narrowing that list to two if a large perceage of people decide to sell after what s happened how can we that coinbase and binance have enough liquidity to facilitate withdrals of the first thing that happened during the great depression were mass attempt to withdraw cash from bank who did not have that cash on hand stable coin are not a solution if you can t sell them you can t spend them tether limited is not the federal reserve no matter how much usdt is mied they cannot create more usd out of thin air i m are of tether limited s claim that usdt is backed but with the massive increase in price across the market that we ve seen over the past two year the reserve of cash in comparison to the rising price ha to be dwindling i m not trying to fear monger but people should be more concerned and should be demanding more transparency for ceralized exchange ledger or trezor s cannot be frozen but if ceralized platform t have enough cash to pay out to those who to sell then it completely undercut any value proposition for cryptocurrency regardless of whatever the price is or how much your is saying it s worth

1,zero knowledge proof application in ethereum ethereum is a public ledger and by it design it s mea to be transpare however there is confusion about it being anonymous beca many people still believe that the blockchain in general is anonymous which is false anything can be tracked on the ledger including the detail of every transaction and deal you ve made since you started trading it may not be a big deal to some especially to those who t understand that their personal privacy can easily be violated a a result of this people are starting to realize that there is a big privacy gap in crypto this ha been lified by the disturbing push for the adoption of cbdcs by the governme which will give them some level of corol over the finance of the general mass zero ledge proof have been cited by many to be revolutionary especially when it come to building privacy tool zkps are encryption scheme in which a party who is a prover prof their case of truth concerning specific data on the other party a verifier without revealing the information here are few of the project that have worked around the technology to build an importa utility privacy in crypto aztec offer r privacy utilizing layer solution specifically the zk rollups system r send transaction request to aztec and the transaction are then put io a batch and rolled up with other rs' transaction which can lead to a longer processing time but ha privacy baked in at a base layer railgun is a privacy preserving smart coract developed on ethereum and s zk snarks to obfuscate transaction detail and make anonymous transaction of any erc token or erc token r also get privacy at rest meaning they can keep a private balance which sn t possible on previous l privacy protocol it work by removing all ideifying information from transaction it s similar to a metamask or any other just with privacy preserving zk snarks in place zether is a confideial transaction amous are hidden and anonymous transaction sender and receiver are hidden payme mechanism on blockchains with an accou model ethereum it is implemeed a a smart coract called zsc of the major limitation that zether is n for is that transaction get processed at the end of a curre epoch inferring that it can be quite difficult on a busy network however it is quite promising and ha everything it take to be among the major player in private crypto overtime i believe that there are many other y to keep a private balance on ethereum a a privacy maxi i would love to hear this subreddit s thought on what s out there in this area a time will come when privacy will become a big word in crypto and we ll have the bulk of crypto r keeping their on chain activity private

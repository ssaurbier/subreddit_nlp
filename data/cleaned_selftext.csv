1,why ftx u president left tweet thread unrolled from brett harrison's latest tweet an hour ago spilling the bean many have asked question about my time at ftx u and why i left when i did a i indicated earlier this week i m happy to begin sharing my experience and perspective publicly i worked at ftx u for seventeen month when my resignation s made public those unfamiliar with my plan were surprised and some questioned whether i d been fired it seemed a though i d left a dream job abruptly after a very short tenure the truth s that ftx u hadn t felt to me like the dream job it appeared to the industry and medium for some time and my departure s not abrupt my relationship with sam bankman fried and his deputy had reached a point of total deterioration after month of dispute over management practice at ftx and a a group of my friend mentor and investor knew then i d felt such a strong conviction to found my own company that it sn t worth keeping a dream job no matter the prestige or upside no matter the risk it posed to my reputation in departing so early sam asked me to join ftx u casually over text in late march he s my former colleague at jane street and i had fond memory of his presence there we d barely stayed in touch over the year but i d occasionally read news about ftx s growth i s happy to hear from him and interested to learn more about how thing were going at ftx i d known sam to be a conscientious junior trader at jane street who d e well in the programming for trader course i taught there in which he d been my student in manager meeting about sam s performance the senior trader on his desk indicated he had promise beyond that he seemed like a sensitive and intellectually curious person who cared about animal and that endeared him to me my negotiation to join ftx u moved quickly a welcome contrast to the month they d taken for every move i d made in traditional finance i d built softre for jane street s crypto desk in but hadn t worked on crypto since i s excited to dive back in my first few month at ftx u were wonderful i worked largely independently of sam to grow a u based team and foster a professional environment prepared for regulated business i made plan with the ledgerx team built out legal compliance and operation department with first in class lateral hire and began setting up and building a u regulated retail stock brokerage ftx u s spot exchange s growing in market share the team s dedicated and productive customer feedback s positive i s excited about the future but from the start i noticed that while sam s rarely engaged on the u business decision impacting the u would come without rning from the bahamas six month into my time at the company pronounced crack began to form in my own relationship with sam around then i began advocating strongly for establishing separation and independence for the executive legal and developer team of ftx u and sam disagreed i saw in that early conflict his total insecurity and intransigence when his decision were questioned his spitefulness and the volatility of his temperament i realized he sn t who i remembered i sn t sure what accounted for the dramatic change i saw in sam like many of u i have family and friend who live with addiction and mental health problem and i ve seen how these problem often manifest without much rning in early adulthood i thought that might be a contributing factor and initially felt sympathetic but i didn t know sam well enough personally or have any real time to reflect on the question i s in a business relationship with him and he s making a number of decision about running a business that i disagreed with there s tremendous pressure not to disagree with sam but i did so anyy at that time and for all of my time at ftx u his influence over the medium ftx s partner the venture capital industry and the traditional finance industry s pervasive and unyielding standing up to an insecure prideful manager is hard under any circumstance but it s nearly impossible when every day every major voice of culture and commerce deafens you with a narrative that implies if you disagree with your manager you clearly must be wrong i sn t the only one at ftx u who disagreed with sam and member of his inner circle ftx u s staffed with experienced professional from u finance firm law firm and regulated exchange our collective experience and professional acumen were frequently treated a though they were irrelevant and valueless it s extremely frustrating for all of u over the ensuing month i further argued for enacting a sensible hiring policy for staffing ftx u with a c suite of experienced officer for transparent communication between sam and ftx u leadership for gary ng s and nishad singh s softre development responsibility to be formally identified and shared across a larger group for the delegation of managerial responsibility and control beyond sam and bahamas based executive and other important matter sam s uncomfortable with conflict he responded at time with dysregulated hostility at time with gaslighting and manipulation but ultimately chose to isolate me from communication on key decision making it felt terrible i sought out information about decision that had been made behind my back desperate but trying hard not to show it in early april my eleventh month i made one last try i made a written formal complaint about what i saw to be the largest organizational problem inhibiting ftx s future success i wrote that i would resign if the problem weren t addressed in response i s threatened on sam s behalf that i would be fired and that sam would destroy my professional reputation i s instructed to formally retract what i d written and to deliver an apology to sam that had been drafted for me that event solidified my decision to leave i knew an abrupt departure would be harmful to the company and my ftx u report and i nted to best position the company for future success after i left so i gradually wound down finished building and releasing the u stock brokerage and saw ftx u employee through their mid year review and with that i shifted my focus to the future and to my own company the information that is now in the public record from indictment complaint guilty plea or otherwise show fact that even now after month are difficult for me to assimilate into reality i raised concern at the company believing that the management and organizational issue i saw were typical of growing start ups and that my role a an experienced financial service executive s to correct them and unlock the next stage of the company s growth i never could have guessed that underlying these kind of issue which i d seen at other more mature firm in my career and believed not to be fatal to business success s multi billion dollar fraud it s clear from what ha been made public that the scheme s held closely by sam and his inner circle at ftx com and alameda which i s not a part of nor were other executive at ftx u i understand now why they carefully concealed their criminal activity from u we have extensive professional network our own line of communication with u regulator and our own authority to speak to u medium if any one of u had suspected let alone learned the truth we would have reported them immediately over my seventeen month at ftx u my colleague and i dedicated everything to serving the need of our customer and growing real business we believed offered consumer a y to more equitably access financial service that are central to their life ancient form of greed and dishonesty destroy trust and corrupt progress the scale of this particular instance of this lesson is difficult to comprehend but far from exceptional in the twelve year of my professional experience in finance it s a strange dissonance after i left ftx u and up until november nearly every conversation i had with a venture capitalist about my new company eventually came around to the same kind of question is ftx investing is sam okay with you doing this do you mind if we confirm with him after that many conversation eventually came around to the same kind of apology we know you weren t involved in what sam and others did but we can t take on the pr risk of associating ourselves with ftx no matter how capable you are or compelling your idea is the last few month have provided me with a valuable character study of the industry some treated me like an entirely different person overnight some immediately offered sympathy and support it will be a difficult experience to forget it will also be difficult to forget the frenzied and baseless accusation leveled against me on social medium for emple that my resignation could only mean i had knowledge of a criminal scheme even though there s no evidence of that and available information show the scheme s run by a small number of people in another country and began year before i joined ftx u or that i m seeking a plea deal even though i haven t been accused of wrongdoing and am not a target in any investigation or that while at ftx u i colluded with citadel to manipulate tokenized stock price yes people are actually saying this i m grateful from the bottom of my heart to those who showed me unvering trust and support through the turbulence of the last two month they helped me cut through the noise and remain focused on the future even a they themselves had been harmed by the tragedy of ftx s collapse i credit them along with my family with getting me through the most devastating and destabilizing event of my professional life i m extremely honored to have them a partner the path ahead of me is clear now and i m excited to move forrd together with them source

1,so thought on why we are pumping so are we pumping because janet yellen ha declared we will hit the debt cieling in a week and the republican in congress seem dysfuctional enough to hit that or are we pumping because the cpi number show lower inflation keep in mind that these are two diametrically opposed reason to pump if the u default the treasury will be downgraded and a a result the interest rate on bond and everything else will go through the roof doesnt matter what the fed think the interest should be it going to go to or more terrible situation if the cpi number are good the fed can say inflation is dropping and lower the interest rate which make for a good situation for risk on asset so which is it is it a pump out of fear of default and u dollar going to zero or a pump out of greed and speculation that the fed will lower interest rate

1,my personal thought and feeling about bitcoin being ideology bitcoin represents different thing for everyone but in such a polarized world i find refreshing that people can stand side by side for something that they believe even though their reason to believe it is different some people here for having the option to keep their saving out of the hand of any institution some just believe the number will rise some actually think this will free people and provide everyone a better future a good thing about bitcoin that it aligns incentive and since the incentive are all aligned even if someone here for the altruistic reason or selfish reason it doesn t really matter and that s a good thing and i feel hope real hope for the future maybe for the first time of my life that we can still unite and build something together slowly but surely i have difficult time to understand why people care about it so much and feel the need to talk badly about it if they believe it will go to zero dollar i t understand the hate or frustration behind it a a counter argument one can say the bitcoiners show a similar attitude tords shitcoins but i think the real frustration there is not related to the pricing of other coin the frustration is there because bitcoin represented and understood by lot of people under the umbrella of cryptocurrencies and the scammer using their fabricated and controlled currency is damaging to what bitcoin is trying to achieve this is a long road and i myself still very new to this ecosystem and when you think about it and know everything started from people and now country discussing it some accepting some refusing energy company starting mining it feel difficult for me to go back to zero but a i said at the beginning apart from the price perspective it is really refreshing for me to be able to believe in something and do something for it it s something that i can feel lacking for my generation so i m happy to be be here and be a part of this journey

1,did gold really have use value before electronics hey all i've been going down the rabbit hole these past month there's a thought i'm trying to work through and i s wondering if someone could sharpen my thinking on this i would appreciate it if you could either correct any missing information or lapse in logic so i s listening to a debate between greg fo peter mccormack and peter schiff one of schiff's argument s money can only work if it commodity money he gave the emple that if the gold price for whatever reason start plummeting it cannot go to zero reason being it will be bought up by industry for their use value namely electronics dental filling and jewelry or sculpture art schiff claim bitcoin can go to zero because there is not use value in the physical world no one need it for computer part no one can eat it etc i find this argument to be incorrect i can't find the ect year but it seems like gold s first utilized a component in electronic device in the early s that leaf thousand of year where gold's only use value s in dentistry and jeweler i think we can dismiss jewelry a a use case for gold why because jewelry is about signaling power and wealth why not wear a necklace made with fool's gold they could make it just a pretty with a nice yellow shine if there s another another magical metal in history that had all the property of gold plus it s only accessible by a word phrase that only the bearer know and can teleport it to the other side of the world would there be a demand for jewelry made from this magic metal meanwhile would the demand for gold jewelry go down considerably i think so it's accurate to say gold's property a a money make people nt to make jewelry out of it not that people desire to make jewelry out of gold because it a beautiful shiny malleable metal gold jewelry is kind of a side effect or application of gold's value it doesn't seem like a use case to me because once gold's monetary value is gone most of the demand for gold jewelry will disappear in regard to dentistry there's a bunch of other metal that can be used including silver so the conclusion i'm coming to with this reasoning is other than dentistry gold s largely a useless rock up until it s used for electronics it functioned a a money for thousand of year because of it's chemical property lend well to use a a money if gold ha function with almost no use case in the real world for thousand of year why can't bitcoin doesn't this mean schiff's argument is kind of weak here one thing to add doesn't bitcoin have use case in cyberspace there's facebook code that siphon data which is more valuable than a real world commodity like oil

1,multi vendor multi sig sparrow wallet one of if not the best self sovereign solution to self custody there is a lot of fear around setting up a multi sig llet whether it's the setup itself or the fear of restoring the llet from scratch it can be intimidating to move from single sig into the wonderful world of multi sig but it's worth it a your stack grows to be a more and more substantial part of your wealth so will the fear of losing your stack via a single point of failure with single sig i know that there are y to create redundancy and security with single sig e g sd card llet backup multiple seedphrase location passphrases but i would argue that if you are willing to create redundancy and extra security with single sig you already have the motivation and likely the technical expertise to move to multi sig so enter multi vendor multi sig sparrow first why multi sig in general there are two major compelling reason for multi sig redundancy from single key loss or theft this one is obvious plausible deniability in a wrench attack this second one s the main one that made me move to multi sig in the ever increasing world of data leak and kyc it ha become almost impossible to stay incognito a a bitcoiner having multi sig make the effort to physically coerce you so much more difficult if an attacker ha to transport you to another location especially if it's a public place like a bank security deposit box and a multi sig becomes the norm then physically coercive attack become le tempting a a whole in the space second sparrow llet make multi sig setup a breeze to start it's open source the ui is so much more user friendly than electrum and it automatically prompt super important step like downloading the backup script to restore the llet it ha been formatted to work seamlessly with almost all the major hardre llets finally why multi vendor multi sig why not just coldcards in a of setup or trezors in a of setup by creating a setup where no vendor ha a quorum of key e g coldcards bitboxes trezor you remove that tiny little worry that one of the company could be malicious and ha somehow gotten your key either via a usb connection or incomplete entropy at key generation or that you've been the target of a supply chain attack technically you should even be able to trust closed source hardre llets e g ledger in a setup like this still recommending open source though a a matter of principle in the bitcoin space however if you go down this route these are the absolute imperative to setting up a multi sig llet you must backup your llet and store a copy of all the xpubs preferably in both electronic and physical form if you need to restore your llet from scratch you will need the xpubs of all the key not just a quorum this is by far the biggest pitfall of multi sig luckily sparrow prompt you to create this backup at the time of llet creation at least preferably all of your hardre llets need to be able to verify the multi sig llet including the xpubs of all signer on the device i won't go into too much detail but malre could insert additional cosigner at the time of llet creation so you need an external validation of the llet setup hardre llets that i know can do this from personal experience are bitbox coldcard and foundation passport i'm sure there are others but i can't speak to those this applies to both single and multi sig but you should alys verify send and receive address on the hardre device itself i will plug for foundation passport on this one they make receive address verification via qr code very streamlined there's a lot more to the actual use of multisig including using psbts with certain hardre llets but these actually 't differ from single sig other than having to do it multiple time rather than just once per transaction i could go on and on about other aspect of v of storage location of key seedless setup but this post is getting long if you are interested in seeing sparrow in action with multi sig here's a great video that finally prompted me to go with sparrow http multisig start at

1,btc price forecast amp discussion id like to offer a few chart i've been working on for an open discussion all opinion thoughs and suggestion are welcome a few note to begin orange vertical line is a halving date green line is top forecast for next cycle the date chosen is the average time to top from the previous halvings line of best fit is exponential look linear on a log base graph chart y axis is log scale base first chart halvings top estimate k second chart halvings top estimate k third chart previous low to current low top estimate k discussion it's interesting to see the lower the timeframe that the chart look back the lower the forecast high of the next cycle is i believe the reason is due to the diminishing blow off top we are seeing from cycle to cycle i have a theory for that bitcoin network access to new fund the first cycle bitcoin gained access to a new pool of fund first mover the second cycle bitcoin also gained access to a new pool of fund through a rise in exchange providing easy access the third cycle bitcoin gained access to new fund through a large increase in medium coverage the fourth cycle current cycle bitcoin didn't gain access fund that would make a significant a step change to the price a it had in previous cycle a such the lack of blow off top in the current cycle effect the best fit price forecast more significantly when the time period emined is lower so where should the top estimate fall with such a wide range showing in the chart between k and k with no significant increase in access to new fund i'm looking at k a a top if several larger nation start to adpot btc a legal tender i'm looking at k a a top if several larger nation and institution gain access through clear and favorable regulation then i'm looking at k a a top i believe on a log scale these event have a similar impact to the previously discussed event in past cycle such a first mover rise in exchange and increase in medium converage we are currently at k suggesting from the current value we see a increase to the top of the next cycle the better question i think is what should an exit strategy look like well we currently have day until the next halving and day until the estimated top based on previous cycle cycle s day from halving to top cycle s day from halving to top with year to top an exit strategy is a tough question to consider especially considering the swing in monetary policy over the last year for now i'm looking purely at the time to top and it correlation with the halving the halving event inherrently form a supply demand crunch causing uprd pressure on the price significant uprd price alys lead to fomo and hence an overshoot on true valve a we have seen in every cycle the time duration of this overshoot ha alys been roughly the same in the btc space again day in the past cycle if there is one thing i am willing to rely on it is that human nature repeat itself this date for those curious is th of october what would have me re evaluate the estimated top date is if one of the aformentioned event large nation adopting btc and institutional access occurs month after the halving in which case i think we could see the top date pushed further out due to a late boom in access to new fund in this case i would start to look at the k to form the basis of my exit strategy rather than a set date let u know your thought a a final though provoker we often see an estimate cap put on btc due to it similarity to gold a a store of value digital gold the valuation of the gold market is roughly t however is estimated to be ish physical to paper ratio why do we not see this considered when corrilating it in a store of value sense to btc not financial advice

1,reading the communist manifesto through bitcoin lens is fascinating if you consider the following from the manifesto the distinguishing feature of communism is not the abolition of property generally but the abolition of bourgeois property but modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating product that is based on class antagonism on the exploitation of the many by the few in this sense the theory of the communist may be summed up in the single sentence abolition of private property we communist have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property a the fruit of a man s own labour which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom activity and independence hard won self acquired self earned property do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form there is no need to abolish that the development of industry ha to a great extent already destroyed it and is still destroying it daily fascinating that the discovery of bitcoin ha single handedly destroyed the entire theory of the communism a for the first time in human history private property can be granted to anyone in the world a a true bearer asset and those right will be upheld by the network regardless of your class background real world influence the hard work one put into accumulating wealth to provide for and protect his family can be exchanged for a private property which is honest sound ethical grounded in physic and mathematics most people on this planet cannot access banking and that is the biggest divider of wealthy inequality because money is half of everything we do the simplicity of code ha removed the marginalisation of the majority of people on this planet by establishing the same property right for a multi billionaire in america and a poor farmer in nigeria while secured via true free market capitalism with the mining industry poor community in rural area are now able to tap into locked up natural resource that would ve otherwise gone to ste by expelling into the atmosphere and monetise the energy by mining bitcoin by implementing a system that respect true integrity soundness and honesty satoshi nakamoto ha quite literally destroyed the main tenant of the communist ideology by providing property right to billion people without exploiting a single being

1,exponential growth understanding and the lack there of a it relates to btc in which i s speculating on btc s usd price to exceed k in and eventually become the global reserve currency within year let get into it human being have a hard time understanding exponential growth for a number of reason one of the main reason is that our brain are wired to think in linear term we are used to thing growing or changing at a steady rate and exponential growth doe not follow this pattern exponential growth is characterized by a rapid increase in which the rate of increase itself increase this mean that the growth becomes faster and faster over time a common emple of exponential growth is the concept of compound interest if you invest a certain amount of money at a certain rate of interest the amount of money you earn will increase over time however the rate of increase will also increase so the longer you leave the money invested the more it will grow this can be hard for people to wrap their head around because it go against our natural instinct we are used to thinking about thing in term of how much they increase by a certain amount over a certain period of time exponential growth on the other hand increase by a certain percentage over a certain period of time which mean that the rate of increase itself increase another reason why human have a hard time understanding exponential growth is that it is difficult to visualize when we think about growth we tend to think about it in term of physical object or quantity that we can see and touch however exponential growth is not something that we can easily observe in the physical world it is a mathematical concept that is difficult to visualize which make it harder for u to understand a further reason why exponential growth can be hard to understand is that it is often counterintuitive for emple if you start with a small number and double it repeatedly the resulting number may not seem very significant at first however if you keep doubling the number it will eventually become much larger than you might have expected this is because each time you double the number you are adding a much larger amount than you did the time before finally human have a hard time understanding exponential growth because it can lead to seemingly impossible or unbelievable outcome for emple if a virus were to double in size every day it would seem impossible that it could take over the world in just a few short week however this is ectly what can happen with exponential growth it may start off small but it can quickly become much larger than anyone could have predicted if you are still with me and are having a hard time connecting the concept of exponential growth to bitcoin let me explain bitcoin a decentralized digital currency ha seen exponential growth since it creation in one of the main reason for this is that bitcoin ha a limited supply there will only ever be million bitcoins in existence and a more and more people become are of and interested in bitcoin the demand for it increase this limited supply combined with increasing demand ha led to the price of bitcoin experiencing exponential growth over time however this exponential growth ha also made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin because of it non linear growth it is difficult to use traditional financial model to forecast the price of bitcoin this ha led to a great deal of speculation and uncertainty surrounding the future of the currency another factor contributing to the difficulty in understanding the exponential growth of bitcoin is the fact that it is a relatively new and highly complex technology the use of blockchain a decentralized ledger that record all bitcoin transaction add an additional layer of complexity to the currency this complexity can make it difficult for people to fully understand how bitcoin work and how it is valued the exponential growth of bitcoin ha been driven by a combination of limited supply increasing demand and the complexity of the technology behind it this growth ha made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin but ha also attracted a great deal of interest due to the potential for significant return on investment in conclusion human have a hard time understanding exponential growth because it go against our natural linear thinking is difficult to visualize is often counterintuitive and can lead to seemingly impossible outcome it is important for people to understand this concept however because it can have significant implication in many different area including economics population growth and the spread of disease tldr exponential growth is difficult for people to conceptualize because it go against our natural linear thinking is often counterintuitive and can lead to seemingly impossible outcome btc ha already experienced exponential growth multiple time and is still in it infancy dca and hodl

1,if the price start going up tomorrow january first i'll start believing this theory the one that say people are selling btc before the end of the year for tax purpose to realize 'capital losses' in year characterized by significant stock loss from almost everyone's portfolio there's at least the small comfort of knowing that these loss can help you reduce your overall income tax bill according to u s tax law the only capital gain or loss that can impact your income tax bill are realized capital gain or loss something becomes realized when you sell it so a stock loss only becomes a realized capital loss after you sell your share if you continue to hold onto the losing stock into the new tax year that is after dec then it cannot be used to create a tax deduction for the old year although the sale of any asset you own can create a capital gain or loss for tax purpose realized capital loss are used to reduce your tax bill only if the asset sold s owned for investment purpose stock and btc fall within this definition that's why many people are selling before the end of the year and will buy back in january source http

1,the bitcoin node rule of consensus make bitcoin well bitcoin however i should preface this post by letting folk know that i am not a coder that said however my concern are that when newer version of bitcoin core come out you see bug fix etc from the previous version but also there are occasionally change to the rule of consensus this essentially mean that if you upgrade to the latest version you effectively vote for that new rule of consensus from your version of what previously you voted bitcoin s imo there should be a differenent approach here when bug are found why not update the older version a well without touching the rule of consensus in said older version you could still have the original version available for reference however this approach would keep the bitcoin network safer and more robust while continuing to allow the individual node operator to decide what version of bitcoin is the true bitcoin which is the whole point aka decentralization for emple i'm not a fan of taro or taproot in general for that matter in the bitcoin protocol so i 't run bitcoin core beyond a certain version unfortunately these version have apparently since had bug reported and remedied by later version that said my concern there is that eventually my version may have fatal bug uncovered and the only y to keep bitcoin running is to upgrade to something that i would consider to be true bitcoin any thought on this would be appreciated in the mean time i'll continue to dca and take immediate possession of my private key to ppkh address only which i generate offline a to forrd this peaceful movement

1,bitcoin being centralised bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that us a peer to peer network to facilitate transaction and validate them through a process called mining it s designed to be a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currency which are controlled by central bank and government however over the year there have been concern about the increasing centralization of the bitcoin network here are a few reason why some people believe that bitcoin is becoming more centralized concentration of mining power a small number of mining pool which are group of miner that combine their computing power to increase their chance of finding a block have a significant proportion of the total mining power on the network this concentration of mining power could potentially allow these pool to manipulate the network and make it more difficult for smaller miner to compete influence of large exchange a small number of large exchange such a coinbase and binance dominate the market for buying and selling bitcoin these exchange have significant control over the price of bitcoin and can potentially manipulate the market to their advantage dependence on a few key player some key infrastructure provider such a bitmain and blockstream have a significant influence on the direction of the bitcoin network these company control important aspect of the network such a the development of the protocol and the operation of key infrastructure which could give them disproportionate power over the network limited number of node while the bitcoin network ha a large number of node a significant proportion of these node are run by a small number of organization this could make it easier for these organization to coordinate and potentially exert control over the network overall while bitcoin s designed to be a decentralized cryptocurrency there are concern that it is becoming more centralized a the network ha grown this centralization could potentially undermine the decentralized nature of the network and lead to more centralized control over the network

1,let's talk about this so i ve noticed a strong trend developing of people asking quite legitimate question of btcs future and that of wider crypto only to be met back with half baked platitude that those of u in the community have heard many time before despite this there are some serious question that the btc community need to consider i ve detailed below a series of real life not technical issue that face btc if anyone can respond to them with genuine logical response then please do so if you feel compelled to reply with something like this is fud or your comment is a buy signal or we have seen this all before then just pop your self back in the poorly informed box from which you came this time is different btc ha never witnessed a macro economic environment like this before this is a fact btc performed a a risk on asset only and is strongly correlated with the like of the nsdq in an environment that may see major index like the s p dow nsdq fail to return ath across a yr period what would this mean for btc the institution are not coming btc took yr to attract a comparatively slight level of institutional interest following significant issue around esg compliance repeated fraud and scam ala tera and ftx etc a well a a lack of regulation it is likely that institution will struggle to regain any foothold within the space ever again we have seen this all before mt gox etc no we haven t never before ha so much been lost by so many in an environment that s already being lined up a a target by regulator the core argument here being that the action of a few crypto bros have likely damaged the space so irrevocably that the coming regulation is likely to be punitive in the extreme for retail it is highly likely that regulator will seek to control all on and off r making it near impossible to own or realise any gain for institution it is likely that the regulation will be designed to limit prevent adoption there will be no etf ever energy usage is an issue regardless of the fact of environmental impact the energy price is not stabilising and is highly unlikely to do so under the current geopolitical condition this is now leading to a declining hash rate this combined with little price action will lead to stagnation what s the narrative a much a the maxi believe in the btc gospel of freedom and pharmaceutical grade money i count my self within this the only thing that ha brought new people to the space is price speculation with the above being true and the potential for little positive price action across a significant timeframe what is the narrative that would bring new people to this space

1,time for an grown up conversation so i ve noticed a strong trend developing of people asking quite legitimate question of btcs future and that of wider crypto only to be met back with half baked platitude that those of u in the community have heard many time before despite this there are some serious question that the btc community need to consider i ve detailed below a series of real life not technical issue that face btc if anyone can respond to them with genuine logical response then please do so if you feel compelled to reply with something like this is fud or your comment is a buy signal then just pop your self back in the poorly informed box from which you came this time is different btc ha never witnessed a macro economic environment like this before this is a fact btc performed a a risk on asset only and is strongly correlated with the like of the nsdq in an environment that may see major index like the s p dow nsdq fail to return ath across a yr period what would this mean for btc the institution are not coming btc took yr to attract a comparatively slight level of institutional interest following significant issue around esg compliance repeated fraud and scam ala tera and ftx etc a well a a lack of regulation it is likely that institution will struggle to regain any foothold within the space ever again we have seen this all before mt gox etc no we haven t never before ha so much been lost by so many in an environment that s already being lined up a a target by regulator the core argument here being that the action of a few crypto bros have likely damaged the space so irrevocably that the coming regulation is likely to be punitive in the extreme for retail it is highly likely that regulator will seek to control all on and off r making it near impossible to own or realise any gain for institution it is likely that the regulation will be designed to limit prevent adoption there will be no etf ever energy usage is an issue regardless of the fact of environmental impact the energy price is not stabilising and is highly unlikely to do so under the current geopolitical condition this is now leading to a declining hash rate this combined with little price action will lead to stagnation what s the narrative a much a the maxi believe in the btc gospel of freedom and pharmaceutical grade money the nly thing that ha brought new people to the space is price speculation with the above being true and the potential for little positive price action across a significant timeframe what is the narrative that would bring new people to this space

1,bitcoin is good for those who have the least cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have the potential to revolutionize the financial system for those who really need it one reason for this is that many people in these country do not trust their government to control their financial system responsibly in many country the level of corruption is high and resource are often time mismanaged cryptocurrencies offer an alternative y to store and transfer value because of this block chain like bitcoin are decentralized and not controlled by any single entity thus providing a level of security and transparency that is often lacking additionally cryptocurrencies can increase financial inclusion in developing country many people in these country do not have access to traditional banking service either because they are too expensive or because they are difficult to get cryptocurrencies offer a y for these individual to participate in the global economy even if they 't have a bank account finally the use of cryptocurrencies can also help to reduce the risk of fraud and other financial crime in developing country because all transaction are recorded on a public ledger it is much harder for fraudulent activity to go undetected overall the future of cryptocurrencies in developing country will be insane they offer a y for people to store and transfer value in a secure and transparent y all while increasing financial inclusion
1,nakamoto coefficient is way higher than people who say so keep considering pool a a unique entity while it is true that someone lead the pool it is wrong to consider all miner to blindly follow regardless of what happens let's consider an attack on the bitcoin network of more than block reverted if a pool leader s to attack following miner would mine block on a hacked blockchain after a few block the hacked blockchain might become the longest one difficulty speaking the hacked chain would get considered a a fork by all honest node because it would imply a reorg higher than honest node would automatically discard the hacked chain the word would spread on all social medias than an attack is going on everyone would manually check they are on the good chain at the same time miner in the hacking pool would start taking action no miner would nt to mine on a worthless chain and a majority of miner are honest thus they would quit the pool the power of the attacking pool would fall dramatically after that the fork would not receive enough difficulty mined to keep up with the good chain and would die i think this whole attack cancellation could be put to work in le than a few hour plus the attacker would lose insane amount of power to mine on a chain that loses in the end let's remember than the majority of our miner nt to make good if they didn't we would punish them anyy so they will never tolerate their mining power to be used by a malicious pool a soon a a pool is labeled a malicious it's over that make their leader completely powerless and that make proof of work the system with the highest nakamoto coefficient achievable

1,there are several key factor that suggest that bitcoin is likely to be valued at over in and could become the global reserve currency in le than year the increasing hash rate of the bitcoin network the hash rate is a measure of the processing power of the bitcoin network and it ha been steadily increasing over time this is an important factor because it help to secure the network and make it more resistant to attack the halving event the halving is a programmed reduction in the rate at which new bitcoins are generated which occurs approximately every four year this event is significant because it reduces the supply of new bitcoins which can lead to an increase in demand and in turn a higher price rapid adoption rate the adoption rate of bitcoin is often cited a being faster than the adoption rate of the internet in it early day this suggests that more and more people and business are starting to recognize the potential of bitcoin a a mean of payment and store of value increasing mainstream acceptance bitcoin is becoming increasingly mainstream with more business accepting it a a payment method and more user friendly platform and product becoming available potential to replace traditional global currency there is a growing belief that bitcoin ha the potential to replace traditional global currency in the next decade due to a ning faith in elite centralized bank and a lack of government accountability bitcoin offer certain advantage over traditional currency such a it decentralized nature which make it resistant to inflation and manipulation by government or financial institution overall these factor suggest that bitcoin ha the potential to continue to rise in value in the coming year while it is difficult to predict the ect trajectory of any asset the increasing hash rate halving event rapid adoption rate increasing mainstream acceptance and the potential for bitcoin to replace traditional global currency all contribute to it potential value in

1,bitcoin exchange standard bitcoin maxi love the idea of bitcoin becoming a widely used a a deflationary currency and it is often compared to gold a a store of value let s look at the history of the gold standard a a comparison specifically the departure from the gold standard leading up to and after wwii the gold standard s spped for the bretton wood system until it s erased by nixon in the early s executive order enacted under fdr required all american to submit their gold to the federal reserve bank after the r the bretton wood agreement signified a change in the global system in which all country in the agreement were required to guarantee convertibility of their currency into u s dollar with the dollar convertible to gold bullion for foreign government and central bank at per troy oz wikipedia this mean all country exchange for u s dollar backed by redeemable gold but that gold is only redeemable by bank and government not your average citizen now my question is highly theortecial what if the u s enacted a similar order for bitcoin in the ke of a collapsing global market and it s made illegal for citizen to hold bitcoin the government pinning the value of the dollar at a certain number of satoshis there would be a branch of the federal reserve devoted to mining rogue mining operation would be highly illegal and other country would compete for maximum mining output this would have dramatic effect on the development of the cryptocurrency industry and on the world there would be many negative and positive what do you think i t actually think this will happen but it an interesting scenario keep hodling

1,security measure for btc spender ok truth is most of u probably hodl btc instead of using it for it intended purpose a a borderless transparent and pp payment system for the rare gem here who do use it according to satoshi's vision what security measure do you take my first thought is about having completely separate hodl stack and spend stack since transaction are transparent and traceable it would make sense to keep your saving separate from the coin you spend a to not become a target for the most paranoid of u even using different exchange for each usecase could be imho a good idea this let you spend your sat safely and allows you to hodl or sell when necessary without exposing yourself this is probably super basic so what other security measure do you use or would you suggest

1,discussion projecting the reduction of price volatility tldr let's have a discussion regarding the trend in price volatility not price for btc and re it heading i would like to see some good analysis on this btc ha been the best performing asset in modern history but this ha come with volatility like no other this volatility while it last is very much a once in a lifetime opportunity for those who can buy and hold over the long term even if they 't time the market particularly well but better if they do that said it's my understanding that volatility is generally decreasing year by year while this is generally regarded a a good thing for increasing the adoption rate of btc it also mean that the oportunity presented by said volatility will lesson over time we see a lot of price projection during the bull run at least but i 't see many volatility projection yesterday i s playing around with the simple annual percentage growth on chart and adding a trend line i'm not going to post it here because i didn't keep the result and i wouldn't consider my method to be particularly savey it s all very rudimentary and not anything i would hang any credibility on i simply observed that yes volatility is decreasing and therefore the expected rate of annual growth would also likley decrease going forrd this doesn't mean that btc isn't still an amazing investment oportunity in addition to all it other societal benifits monetary freedom store of value etc but it doe mean our growth expectation shouldn't be a high a we observed in the last three halving cycle i say expectation because there are alys external factor disaster r new tech that can affect short term price in iether direction i guess what saying is it would be interesting to see more competent analysis regarding the volatility trend and re it heading

1,what if the u federal government attacked bitcoin with a throughput attack a in clog up all the transaction throughput with a bunch of dummy transaction in order to slow down the network and thus discourage it's usage here's how it would work they print a couple billion dollar they buy a million hardre llets each llet buy a few hundred thousand sat then an army of bureaucrat sends the sat back and forth to each others' llets over and over again producing far more than transaction per second and that's all those bureaucrat do all day it's their job and they could then afford to attach super uber crazy high fee to each transaction say worth of sat per transaction essentially crowding out anyone who nt to use the bitcoin network to send their own transaction it would drive the fee sky high through the roof which would cause most ordinary people to be turned off from using bitcoin if they kept this up for a few year it would stifle the network and no one would nt to use it because you'd have to compete with those high fee which are artificially driven up by governmental action it really seems to me that this could be the most effective y for the government to attack bitcoin with just a couple billion which is a drop in the bucket for the u govt hell powell could crank that out in a keystroke they could make every fee for an entire year be more likely far higher seriously transaction second about million year so for a little over a billion they could make the fee be at least on each transaction making it prohibitively expensive to use the network for any small transaction what are your guys' thought on this

1,i have big question about bitcoin transaction i'm trying to understand some thing about bitcoin and i've been searching for day tching video reading article none of them have explained it to my absolute understanding it's frustrating question transaction input where ectly do the input come from i learnt they are utxo's unspent transaction output from previous transaction which transaction and to whom doe every payment that come to me generate a new utxo so for emple if people have recently sent me btc to a single address i own do i have separate utxo's to spend use a input for my next transaction that s my reasoning and it seemed to be making sense until i came across info that said the input can come from different address huh okay look like they have a point though because when i check the block explorer for transaction i actually see distinct address a input and output it should mean that every address can rather only have one utxo at a time right and multiple utxo's should definitely come from different address but if multiple address are used a input shouldn't all of them be owned by the sender because only the sender should authorise a transaction now if that's the case how is that e because with the llets i've used trust and binance i 't see an option to select multiple address i own and combine their value when i'm sending btc so what's happening can multiple input only be achieved using low level coding or something when i search for how to send bitcoin from multiple address or similar i 't find anything that answer my question it's a if that's not possible i'm just not getting it for the output i understand but the input haven't really been explained to me can someone who understands this from a to z spell it out for me without leaving anything out i'd be really grateful question block confirmation and reversibility many source say that transaction that have or more confirmation can be considered irreversible okay logically that should mean that with le than confirmation the transaction can be reversed now what i know about block confirmation is that it's the number of block that have been added to the blockchain after the one that contains the transaction in question so that mean even with one or two confirmation the block is actually on the public blockchain right so if the transaction can be reversed how is that e will it be pulled down from the blockchain funny question what would happen to the block after it meanwhile if you search for can bitcoin transaction be reversed all the answer you get are no so what's really the point here
1,how long can you keep a secret i s thinking about possible black sn event with respect to btc and realized that satoshi nakamoto's identity could be the biggest one in the past i have simply discredited any such deliberation a something that rather the gossip medium would focus on than i remembered the saying three can keep a secret if two of them are dead i believe benjamin franklin said these word so my question is how much longer can people keep satoshi's identity a secret unless he ha never revealed his it to anyone but is that even possible there is m btc in his llet so assuming those coin are not lost forever is there a substantial risk of a black sn event in short to medium term what do you think

1,discussion on an ideal economic model for our future do i have the following correct in this hypothetical future bitcoin is the medium of exchange and store of value in a country the vast majority of people just save money since there is no more government induced inflation price of all good are relatively stable except in natural disaster situation and supply chain fluctuation the financial investment industry ha shrunk exponentially there are still people who are investor and provide this expertise for a fee or commission it is extremely transparent where each satoshi of your tax go to public entitlement program are very limited and completely funded a the money supply is almost predictable now publicly funded pension are almost unheard of there are a lot more private company providing what were once largely publicly funded service such a public safety bank still exist but their business model is more about pooling investor fund and providing a bitcoin custody service for the people who 't feel comfortable holding their own coin bitcoin custodial service are a big deal a personal home robbery are now fairly commonplace bank are not required to have a reserve ratio but customer understand that if a bank doe not then they may lose their money if something happens to the bank bank are nowhere near too big to fail anymore people can choose to invest their bitcoin into various project to try to multiply their wealth and they understand that they can lose their money if the project fails end of story there is a free market for interest rate loan are largely sourced from private lender and or bank but there is no more central bank nor a national interest rate decided by a small group of people there is still a stock market because company still have the freedom to try to publicly fund their business idea but it's no longer the behemoth that it once s a money is hard money and isn't a easy to come by a it once s are their big hole in this economic model i'm sure i'm missing important part a it's impossible to summarize an economy feel free to add your own thought and idea i enjoy discussing these kind of thing thanks

1,coldcard wont allow factory reset im thinking of getting a coldcard since it seems to be the most safe y to store btc ive been doing my research and it turn out that factory reset is not an option so you must use the llet a you receive it yes i know you can check the source code from github to check if it the original and it also come with some ter evident security measure to make sure your coldcard is legit when you receive it my main concern is what stop the creator from coldcard stealing your fund in the future so we cant trust an exchange cause not your key not your coin but we must trust a developer of llets how do we know that embedded in the source code there isnt a backdoor or that when they make a firmre update you end up giving up your seed phrase and balance to them no just coldcard but any harre llet maker like trezor or ledger do we change trust from an exchange to a hardre llet manufacturer
1,the basic economics of why bitcoin ha value i've been seeing a lot of new people that seem to have no grasp on the basic of economics regarding currency what give it value etc i posted this a a comment in another thread that didn't get much attention so i thought i would post it again a it own post to help those who are new to bitcoin or 't have much understanding of the fundamental value proposition of bitcoin a a currency first you need to ask yourself why the dollar ha any value learn a bit about the history of money the first currency were commodity money they derived their value from their intrinsic use but they were cumbersome to use so we invented paper money that s backed by commodity such a gold which could be exchanged for it and gave it value in the u fed stopped allowing dollar to be exchanged for gold making our money fiat money with no backing fiat mean command it is created out of nothing by an issuing authority now think about what the federal reserve ha been doing and the effect their action have had on the economy they previously lowered interest rate to interest rate are the cost of obtaining money money that ha no cost to obtain ha no value and an unlimited supply the money supply ha been increased by more than over the last year and much more than that over the previous century you can view the fed's own data here the value of the dollar over the long term is trending tord zero along with every other fiat currency look at this chart and see how much value it ha lost over time http most money is already digital it's just a database in your bank's server that ha name associated with amount le than of the money supply exists a cash it would be impossible for everyone to convert their electronic deposit into cash bank actually create extra money in the money supply when they make loan reserve requirement were suspended in the covid era meaning bank could create unlimited amount of loan with no reserve at all this is stuff you would all learn in an intro economics class but it's very fundamental to understanding why any currency ha value or loses it value money derives it value from being something that is fungible durable divisible portable and limited in supply the more of these property it ha the better it is a money it must serve a a unit of account a medium of exchange and a store of value the better it is at these thing the better it is a money bitcoin ha all of these quality making it useful a money it's much more divisible than the dollar much more portable and more limited in supply so far the bitcoin network ha never had a major outage or hack it is free and open source with out a central authority so far it value ha only gone up over the long term despite it high volatility in the short term limited supply is essential a currency's potential a a long term store of value many country have hyperinflated their currency with disastrous result right now around the world many country are experiencing extremely high amount of inflation learn about what ha happened in argentina venezuela zimbabwe hungary and many more country due to hyperinflation it's a crisis around the world almost all the world's country use fiat currency now many people in these country face authoritarian government or do not have access to a stable currency bitcoin ha obvious usefulness to these people a well a anyone else who nt an alternative to fiat money that will do nothing but lose value over time

1,the first rule perhaps this ha already beeen suggested but i think from now on the first rule of bitcoin should be do not talk about it be about it run a nodestack sat with the fiat money you get from recycling or working or however you mine fiat and go about your business we are in the winter of a certain discontent but now is the time visualize and grind learn a much a you can listen to all side of argument think about how satoshi basically picked the lock of the financial pyramid designed and implemented a better y and then instead of talking about it he saw himself out and disappeared if you meet like mind fine but otherwise if people 't get it you 't have time to explain it
1,what happens when all the bitcoins have been mined hi guy i've got something on my mind miner are rerded by finding block and are rerded by bitcoins and transaction fee which are very low but what happens when all the bitcoins have been mined miner can't just cover their cost with the transaction fee which mean that mining becomes unprofitable which is why many people get out and the network is weakened or more susceptible to attack or will transaction fee increase once all bitcoins have been mined but that would be bad for u a a community in that case because every transaction would be too expensive for u or am i wrong i look forrd to any clarification

1,is bitcoin dead my family is starting to say bitcoin is maybe about to die this is usually a big buy indicator i would have been ball deep in bitcoin rn if it sn t for the uncertain time for economy right now i personally think bitcoin may drop a little bit before starting a new bull run but damn when people start saying bitcoin is dead it s usually the best time to buy i know the best thing is just to buy periodically and forget about the price
1,whats wrong with me so to make it short i'm into bitcoin since some year already bought my dreamcar in pretty expensive and a younimer had some fun and sold it with a gain just after maybe month because the bitcoin price s so tempting at beginning i put a lot of that money back into bitcoin and from the remaining amount i bought another sportcar thats awesome so far but i have it since maybe month and i'm already thinking about selling it early to put the whole money back into bitcoin again it seems like i can't have any expensive consumer shit anymore because i alys think that money will be better in bitcoin and thats a fact the new sportcar will lose value over the next year while on the other hand bitcoin you know i really like the car and would like to stay with it but the price of bitcoin is just so tempting i just realized the last year that thing like sportcars are fun but not for a long time i get used to them so fast and the feeling of the new stuff really vanishes pretty fast on the other hand i'm happy about my satoshis since year without losing any fun or hope about it

1,what happens when most of the bitcoin is gone there's a finite supply of btc and it can only be broken down so much a people lose track of their seed phrase lose their llets etc the supply dwindles the price go up a it becomes more scarce so eventually satoshi would be worth more than many item cost and you can't give change there's already over mil of all btc removed from circulation
1,assuming bitcoin will need a smaller unit than sat eventually how doe that look from a technical point of view due to bitcoin's hard cap if bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency and all thing become naturally priced in bitcoin this would mean that each bitcoin and each sat will become more and more valuable a the economy grows i know assuming the economy will grow indefinitely is not a trivial a i'm making it sound but let's just assume it'll be the case for this thought experiment so basically thing will cost le and le bitcoin and we will reach a point when a single gummy bear will be worth le than sat at this point we'll need a smaller unit in order to pay for everyday stuff even a cup of coffee will be worth le than sat eventually hell you could say that about almost anything if you go far enough in the future assuming the human race survives till the universe end so my question are what's the code change needed to make this a reality is it just changing some value on a line of code in github and then of course the majority of the node accepting the change if so where is that line why sn't bitcoin made infinitely divisible in the first place are there some technical issue that would arise if this s the case what's the reasoning behind choosing million per bitcoin a the lower limit and not million or billion

1,doe bitcoin change human nature in an ideal world where fiat no longer ha any value and trade and commerce operate solely using a finite store of value like bitcoin what stop it all from ending up in the possession of corporation like how we re seeing with money now wouldn t people being consumer and business being cash hoarder still create a flow of wealth into the hand of the few people who own the business sure they ll pay in bitcoin but their main goal is profit so they aren t going to be working a net zero profit business or even during the transitional period say coca cola start taking bitcoin a payment for their product a it s catching on with the public they wouldn t be obligated to pay their employee in bitcoin so they would already have a huge head start in accruing a large share of the value i m not implying that i ve heard that bitcoin is the answer to the world problem or anything i m genuinely curious if there is any y that a quality of a currency like bitcoin might alleviate problem like these like is this a human problem or a money problem

1,i m a bitcoin maxi but there is one thing i can t see how it can work i m listening to economics in one lesson by henry hazlitt which is a great reminder of how government should not control the money apart from many other thing all the y through it i ve been saying to myself bitcoin fix that i m up to the chapter that contrast a spend thrift with a saver and the obvious benefit of being frugal it describes how benjamin save half his capital in a bank which then lends that money out to help other business start up etc but that got me thinking how doe that work with bitcoin which the mantra is not your key not your coin and thus a we all should i have my btc locked up in a hardre llet but that s it it s locked up it isn t earning interest it isn t helping the economy by being lent out to other startup is there such an analogue in the crypto world one that you would actually trust your bitcoin with after ftx i know i wouldn t i used to have some of my btc in with crypto com s earn feature but the rate of return s negligible and it meant my btc s in their hand which we all know you t do in short i d love to know if this problem is being addressed and where is it safe a house to invest your btc for any sort of return at all or are we still iting on someone to invent a dao or dex that cannot be ripped off by the like of a sbf

1,question concerning solvency of bitcoin ok basic question here to my knowledge btc requires miner to validate transaction proof of work and mining requires an expenditure of energy which cost generally some kind of fiat currency a bitcoin half and becomes harder to mine the relative profit margin approach the cost of mining further fluctuation in the value of btc potentially mean putting miner underter versus the cost of mining electricity hardre what happens when the cost of mining outstrips the profit of btc say the cost of mining one btc is btcs in the relative fiat currency if miner drop out and transaction cannot be validated the relative exchange value of btc is thus since no exchange can take place is there something i'm missing here this seems like a weakness inherent to pow crypto especially btc which ha a growing cost to mine based upon the halving aspect of the hash mining further i cannot think of a real world counterpart since exchanging gold isn't incumbent on anyone mining it in fact a gold miner drop out the cost of gold would increase due to the effect of scarcity i'm sure i'm missing something since this seems like an obvious real threat to crypto a an investment vehicle at least proof of work model that rely on mining to validate exchange transaction

1,feeling grateful for bitcoin hey everyone i just nted to share my thought on bitcoin with the community a a fairly new bitcoiner myself i am constantly amazed by the resilience and strenh of this revolutionary digital asset one thing that really stand out to me is the decentralized nature of bitcoin unlike traditional financial system that are controlled by a small group of individual or institution bitcoin is powered by a global network of node that work together to secure the blockchain this decentralization ensures that no single entity ha control over the network making it resistant to censorship and corruption another aspect of bitcoin that i find particularly impressive is it ability to act a a store of value while the price of bitcoin can fluctuate in the short term it value ha consistently increased over time making it a reliable investment for the long haul but perhaps what i love most about bitcoin is it potential to bring financial freedom to people around the world in country with unstable currency or oppressive government bitcoin provides a y for individual to take control of their own wealth and financial future overall i am bullish on bitcoin and can't it to see what the future hold for this groundbreaking technology what about you guy why do you love bitcoin

1,bitcoin intrinsic value based on the cost of energy used by miner hello everyone today i would like to share with you an indicator i created that calculates the fair price of bitcoins by taking into account the cost of energy consumed by miner the bitcoin intrinsic value cost of energy bivcoe indicator stem from an algorithm that relates data on the energy consumption of the bitcoin network to the supply in circulation in doing so i s able to establish the cost required in energy term to produce a bitcoin potentially an intrinsic value of the coin that when correlated with the market price will be able to give interesting insight into overbought sold cycle i s able to develop this indicator thanks to data provided by the university of cambridge related to energy consumption this data is extremely efficient and with a relatively low error rate a it is based on a mathematical model that take into account multiple factor including the evolution of the profitability threshold of the miner obsolescence here you can find the indicator that is updated every month i hope it can be helpful

1,who work for whom the dependence on the government s ability to print money ha created an unbalanced master slave paradigm where the people are forced to involuntarily finance the government s money printer this reliance on government printing ha effectively removed the accountability of public entity a they no longer work for the people but rather the money printer the government s ability to endlessly print money without repercussion mean that the people no longer own their government the lack of check and balance in the system ha caused public entity to instead look to outside source such a corporation ll street foreign nation and the military industrial complex for extra money similar to a side hustle for a paycheck this creates a conflict of interest a the people no longer own their government and the government is now working for the money printer not the people this is why there is such a disconnect between the government and the people these day the people are increasingly feeling unacknowledged and unheard and this is due to the government s reliance on it money printer public entity are no longer accountable to the public a they only strive to please the money printer the good news is that there is a solution to this problem and that is bitcoin by creating a decentralized monetary system the people can take back ownership of their government a the money printer no longer hold the power bitcoin creates an environment of financial freedom a the government no longer ha the power to control the money supply furthermore it creates the transparency that the government and the people need in order to work together in conclusion since the transition from hard money to fiat money the government ha become a master and the people have become it slave public entity are no longer accountable to the people a they now work for the money printer however with the introduction of bitcoin the people can once again take back ownership of their government and create a more transparent and fair relationship between the two party

1,understanding bitcoin's blockchain not too high level not too detailed typical description of blockchains like bitcoin's either gloss over the how blockchains work or quickly become mired in detail blockchain basic took me day to understand from what s available here i attempt a description that's somewhere in the middle a description i found myself comfortable with hopefully it s at a level that some others have been looking for http while i'm a mathematician and computer scientist i am not an expert on blockchains and i would greatly appreciate any feedback also any additional reference at the level of this white paper would be appreciated note an understanding what i've written requires some familiarity with computer science

1,i am very confident in my prediction that bitcoin will reach million within the next year i firmly believe that this is a realistic goal that can be achieved i'm sure others see it coming a well and i'm excited to see the progress that will be made in the coming year it's an exciting time for bitcoin and i'm sure that it will only continue to grow in value let s say we invest in bitcoin today at the current price of per coin would give you approximately of a bitcoin if the expected price of million per coin in is realized then your investment will be worth which is a x return this prediction is based on seven assumption such a increasing demand for bitcoin and using a confident and polite tone a the demand for bitcoin continues to rise the value of the coin is expected to increase a well i am confident that bitcoin ha a limited supply making it an attractive asset for long term investment a bitcoin continues to become accepted worldwide it value is likely to continue to increase further facilitating it usage and stability furthermore increasing investment in bitcoin from institutional investor will increase it liquidity and demand making it an even more attractive option for investor overall i am optimistic about the future of bitcoin and believe it will continue to be a viable asset for investor the infrastructure for bitcoin transaction need to be improved in order to make it easier for user to transact and invest in bitcoin with more people using bitcoin to store their wealth it value is likely to continue to increase making it a potentially good investment over the next year if these assumption are reasonable then the price prediction could be accurate i believe this is a worthwhile endeavor and i would appreciate it if you could upvote this answer if you found it helpful please feel free to share and comment your thought and opinion below

1,random whiskey thought from a btc degen my price point are referenced in cad people alys refer to ath's and the couple of crazy bullruns we had in the end of and once covid hit i 't think those bull run are indicative of the real price of bitcoin they are sexy sure and everyone love high flying number but if you look at all time chart and cut out the mountain peak you see a real steady growth from price before the bull run in bitcoin ha doubled i 't know how to articulate it very well but covid saw interest rate basically cut to and government doing everything they could to keep the ball moving forrd while facing a once in a hundred year crisis i think the people that expect bitcoin to hit k k in the next bull run are not factoring in extreme anomaly in market condition bitcoin s k before the bull run and bitcoin s k in before the covid bull run and now it's holding it's own in the k price range despite incredibly bearish event that sparked panic in the bitcoin crypto world i think this is really promising sure maybe bitcoin could go parabolic when alien invade or some other unforeseen event happens but i think the k to k in year and k to k in year is the most realistic value trajectory which still make it one of the most incredible store of value and appreciating asset in our current time somewhere in the range of growth every year is fucking insane anyys i just nted to give a realistic not when my lambo take on the lonerm gain on bitcoin if in it is k and it is k and k and k i am going to be one happy cer

1,replay attack on blockchains one of the easiest attack possible on all blockchains is the replay attack it basically take advantage of hard fork to use a valid transaction from one of the chain and broadcast it to another let s take an emple we create an hardfork called bwef bitcoin wef of course our shitcoin will be shorted on market and nobody will support it but like ethw people will know they can sell it and get fee money you have btc so you received bwef trading each for k for free let s dump it quick so you nna sp you bwef on a website for free money houray in order to do this you have to send your bwef by creating a transaction and signing it you then sell and get your dollar so you got your k for a shitcoin you didn t nt anyy that s just a win right but here is the issue your transaction is public and is also valid on real btc chain so now an attacker can broadcast this same transaction on original chain this could be the buyer of your bwef now the buyer a received your bwef and your real btc you re sold your btc for k so now let s talk about how to protect from this afaik there is no y to protect from what i just describe the only thing we can do is to avoid interacting with forked chain which can be difficult because most people t use their own node so when signing and broadcasting a transaction they may be sending it to a node of the forked chain so if someone know more about this and would like to correct me share info like how to protect or anything please do i think this would help greatly community
1,willing to buy bitcoin for gift card from amazon danke
1,bitcoin in the far future the only thing i think is missing about bitcoin technology is a y to really slowly recycle itself let me explain imagine in thé far future when all bitcoins will be mined or almost the biggest bitcoin source available will be old storage from our time old account lost bitcoins etc they will probably be an industry trying to found them back in a y or another the amount of lost bitcoin will be massive and compared to thé mining production they will be a time where finding only a single one hard llet from our time could be worth of multiple year of mining production this is not a sane balance for an economy the non lost bitcoins will be used for thé economy but if they are btc holder who are too big they will own a too big of thé total amount of money to exist let s say a familly for exemple that inherited bitcoin from generation to generation they could or own stupid amount of thing or acting by themselves a a modifier of bitcoin value order of magnitude too high probably with the ability to make price triple or divide by easily if a money like this exist in far future propose who are not privilegied by it will legitimately look ay for other solition and probably create other cryptos collectively and decide to use them instead what would be a imo sane thing to do is adding a evaporating rate to bitcoin let me explain to avoid that few people could own too massive proportion of bitcoins and keep the currency viable and fair enough to let people continue to use it we could maybe add a system who could make a small évaporation raté happen so for exemple each year of the btc you own evaporate and go back to the mineable bitcoin pool number can vary this will also allow a reneble and constant suply of new btc this is the most equal option everyone have the same evapotax we could also balance this in a more fair y like evaporzting bitcoin faster for biggest bitcoin holder above some cap to avoid people to squeeze this by dividing their wealth into multiple account we will need them to be or nominated to a single person or to a single family and a y to make sure it is not squeezable then let s say that for each time you own x more than the average account balance to let this method grow with increasing of decreasing population you pay twice more so per year evaporate of your btc above time the average balance above time the average above time the average k m time thé average etc etc evaporate per year at million time the average at million time at a billion time etc that also add an incentive to make thé average people wealthier so it will be really hard to own more than a billion time the average person wealth who seem like a minimum to keep thing somehow balanced of course that s random number that could be adjusted up or down that will keep the economy somewhat balanced and allow more evaporation to happen and at the same time still allow for big fortune to exist but without having too much inequality capped in this exemple at billion time the average because after that evaporate per year so basically all of it we could maybe even imagine a system where the under average balance get a small percentage of wealth evaporated from big one we could say that like half evaporation go to mining and half to slightly lower inequality could be a modest redistributive and fair economical system we need also a y to make people who die inherit their fortune to their kid to avoid the death people account to count among the total number of active account and if not possible redistributed to the mining pool this y we could have a monetary system bitcoin like with a fix amount of currency a y to slowly get back potential lost bitcoins trough evaporation a y to slowly give back bitcoin to the mining pool and keep the suply running a y to avoid too much inequality but still allowing fortune to exist without allowing too indecent one or monopoles to a y potentially to redistribute a part of the wealth to the le fortunate trough a part of the evaporation we could call this condensation on lower than average or average balanced account this will be a low amount in any case because lower than average account and average account will be much more in number than the above one who pay for it and that s how you keep a currency system sane stable and fiable for extremely long period of time and make it automatically adjusted to total population number change up or down allowing humanity to eventually becaume a multi planetary specie a we should be if we are not filtered out of existence before and that s how you also assure people to be able to keep a stable decentralised predictible non inflationist currency who evaporate or not at all or reaaaly slowly depending on how rich you are also putting a smaaaaal pressure on people to spend or invest and keep the money moving in the economy being rich is this world would only mean owning a bigger part of the cake who evaporate faster and of nothing is e or if badly used or lost will go back to average with time trough evaporation who go half to the le fortunate half for the miner who keep the thing working a bitcoin made on this kind of system could be much more viable long term and even becaume a ultimate and universal currency aly adjusting itself to any situation to go back to the society wealth distribution programated in some year and still of course remunerating miner and mining who make the system work and continue to that s an interesting topic imo and could be the solution to a lot of issue that today currency have or even cryptos have or even decentralised cryptos have excuse my bad english

1,difference between cold storage and no storage this is probably a dumb question but if you move bitcoin to a cold storage llet then i understand that it is not on your computer anymore and that this is more secure a you can't get hacked unless somebody get the cold storage drive and know how to get in but if you move bitcoin to say an electrum llet and save the seed phrase on paper somewhere or in your head and then you delete the electrum app completely from your computer then also you would not be able to hacked via your computer if somebody gained access to it so what really is the difference or pro con of the approach is there anything wrong with just deleting the llet app and not spending extra money on a cold storage device since you can alys recover the llet with the seed whenever you nt access to the bitcoin by reinstalling the llet softre

1,help me believe in blockchain technology again lately i have been having a bit of an existential crisis with the true utility of the blockchain i s initially drawn in by the digital goldrush but like many i stayed because i really believed in the future of crypto a this bear market ha progressed i have been filtering through the junk a i dive deeper into crypto and blockchain technology i am starting to see le how the blockchain ha real utility here are a couple of my opinion i would love if somebody with more knowledge of the space could refute anything i say with evidence possibly crypto's greatest strenh is the decentralized network and ability to process instantaneous transaction this is especially useful for large payment and international transaction the problem is there no easy y to convert bitcoin to fiat without using a centralized exchange the argument would be that eventually we could use bitcoin or other token a transactional currency but we are still far from there needing to rely on exchange to convert bitcoin to fiat come with many of the problem that come with transferring money to begin with at the end of the day unless you are transferring crypto from one llet to another and the receiving party plan on just holding the crypto it offer very little improvement to wire transfer the second issue i have is with linking token or nfts to physical good despite the blockchain being a brilliant and secure y of tracing transaction since there is no y to link a real physical world item to the blockchain it make tracing item impossible i often hear about using blockchain in regard to the supply chain assuming a qr code is used to track certain item the qr code can alys be removed or recreated it would also rely on alys scanning the qr code to track it if the code is not scanned then the transaction will never show up in the case of digital item like nft art it cost so much energy to upload medidata on chain that it is not feasible most nfts rely on medidata server to store the nft which make the whole point of having a blochian pointless to begin with you can t hide the medidata for confidential document you t own the copyright to the nft in a legal sense and you can t prevent anybody from copying the medidata you own on the blockchain this lead to the last point which is most if not all crypto project are creating solution to problem they invented aside from the obvious pump and dump even legitimate project do not offer real world value it seems like so much of crypto relies on the narrative that we will be socializing transacting and living more in the digital world most project assume one day their project will be useful while that may be the case it seems like we are still far from living in a ready player style world i t know of any project except bitocin that that solve a problem that exists today and solves the problem in a y no other technology could to summarize it seems like crypto is a cool technology that ha very little practical use in today s world i still love the crypto world and i nt to believe in it but i am seeing le and le a true use for it a i take off the goggles and try to look at everything from a practical and productive point of view the argument for crypto is becoming le and le clear to me please educate me on what i am missing because i know i really am looking to learn

1,trusting bitcoin service and business bitcoin is all about understanding and managing your own risk and trust be that the decision to run a node or not use a light llet or not a company node llet or not you also have to decide who you will give your business to and what risk you're willing to expose yourself to when engaging with bitcoin service with that in mind let's conceptualize a few different kind of bitcoin service so we know to look out for them and can make educated choice a consumer the low trust service this is a bitcoin service delivered in a low trust manner where the bitcoin user need only utilize softre they run and control for the service and can protect themselves from malicious third party with very little trust or consequence from peer this is the gold standard of bitcoin service emples include lightning routing lightning liquidity marketplace like pool coinjoins like joinmarket coinsps submarine sps like loop and others when at all possible this is the kind of service you nt to run many service and contract in bitcoin or layer will claim to be low trust even decentralized which isn't all necessary for a business they are supposed to be centralized but very few are ask yourself what recourse you alone have against fraud and what fraud would be possible for emple in lightning you protect yourself from fraud by tching the blockchain and storing proof of your off chain transaction you can broadcast at will you have responsibility tch the blockchain and recourse publish transaction proving fraud and claim balance the risk revolve around your own capacity time delay locking up your coin and other general inconvenience not impacting your custody trust the service will be provided this is your typical business or website where you pay for the good or service before you get it and have little to no recourse if the service is not provided pretty normal you're risking whatever you're spending in a transaction emples include every merchant business accepting bitcoin the merchant using btcpay server and non custodial exchange like bullbitcoin http this is also a very good model with limited risk but often little recourse the federated trust service this is a bitcoin service which spread responsibility across a number of actor for success or failure it's not nearly a good a trusting yourself and relies on third party to protect your interest emples include liquid rsk http peg multisig custodian bisq escrow these service often delve into shitcoins and when they do should be avoided like any other the risk in these case is often not exceptionally limited include custody and your recourse relies on third party if any exists at all the first party custodian this bitcoin service relies on only itself it often pride itself on this self reliance boasting a lack of third party and self custody river financial is a good emple if you can trust the one business these can be quality service the risk in these custodian are similar to a federated service but only trusting one party the rd party custodian this is a bitcoin service which relies on a third party custodian like prime trust http emples include strike and sn http among many others while both are bitcoin only company the custodian they rely on hold over shitcoins http these kind of service can be dangerous because they can appear to be very bold bitcoin only company but on closer inspection you will find they 't self custody a central tenant of a good bitcoin participant in the space user and business alike this can expose user to all kind of risk and broadens the number of actor exposing user to risk even if it's not just custody for emple kraken just leaked user data http via a zendesk leak this is why evaluating who you are trusting is important and i make these specific emples to illustrate why you can't take even well respected community member at their word you need to evaluate for yourself are you trusting them or a tower of service provider the shitcoin casino this isn't a bitcoin service at all it's a public harm these are exchange which service and host scam exposing their user to the custodial risk of their shittiest shitcoin they often print their own shitcoins they lure user in with too good to be true fee they should be avoided at all cost emples include coinbase binance kraken gemini kucoin and many many others most others i won't be linking them because you shouldn't use them tl dr a you evaluate what kind of business and service you nt to use what risk you're willing to expose yourself and your coin to and hopefully even what kind of business you nt to encourage in this space consider all your option not every service ha made the same trade offs or requires the same trust consider minimizing your exposure to this contagion and not only get off exchange and custodial service but reevaluate the service we're doing business with in the first place avoid shitcoin custodian and service use lower trust solution let's do more diligence on who we are trusting and how

1,bitcoin is a social construct not crypto since bitcoin had a price people have tried to recreate it but with twist like the owner of this one get a huge chunk of supply then supply get released when mining or this one ha this cool development team or technology behind it therefore better than bitcoin these recreation all focused on the idea of bitcoin a a technology when in fact even the technology used to run bitcoin is subject to change at the whim of social consensus take robux for a minute robux is a popular digital asset issued by the robux corporation it ha exchange though mostly underground for fear of reprisal from the robux corporation what is the functional difference between robux using an sql database between their server and robux using a private blockchain where only robux server can create the proof of work for transfer it still permissioned robux still ha full say over whether transfer even happen between account and robux is still sold by the robux corporation crypto is much more akin to robux in this y crypto is not subject to the whim of it userbase it is only subject to the corporation behind it bitcoin doe not work in this y bitcoin is a social construct the bitcoin core devs have e a pretty good job at making sure nothing that would upset the people who run the softre get through but what would happen if they did new rule block size will now be gb instead of mb the first problem they'd run into is that the new softre is not compatible with the softre everyone else is running people who run the softre would be pretty upset at hard drive space filling up rapidly and fork the project into a new repository you now have two chain but which chain is bitcoin so that's what i mean when i say bitcoin is a social construct any argument you'd make over which get to be bitcoin is you enforcing that social construct the current construct around what is bitcoin is that the chain that is compatible with the older softre get to be bitcoin it but the original bitcoin github repo get to be bitcoin i hear you scream so let talk about the next problem the original repo would encounter from ignoring the people who run bitcoin when you use a bitcoin llet and you 't run your own node you use the node that softre llet default to now maybe that softre llet enforces the idea that bitcoin is the core repo but it could just a well decide to enforce the social construct that bitcoin is whatever is compatible with an older version of the softre in fact it probably would do this by default via not noticing that a new client s even released i mean i can't help but notice that this very sub ha a link to download version of core even though version s released miner and price i can't talk about the role that miner would play into this without also including how the price of each chain would effect the miner if user prefer to use one chain over the other it price will go up which make miner nt to mine that chain instead of the other one this mean the chain that go against the user wish is vulnerable to the hashpower of the chain that support user decision being part of the dominant monetary network ha it perk the dominant monetary network is evidence of the strenh of the social construct at hand right now the strongest social construct for money is that government issued paper is money bitcoin is here to challenge that social construct with it own

llet use you can start right now without set up you just need someone to tip you i recently discovered there is a tip bot that you can use in the bitcoin sub and i think others the great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning llet and then withdraw your tip or use your own lightning llet to add sat to your personal tip jar you 't need to if someone tip you sat then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your username and add in sat to it that's the minimum tip then you can use the same command in a message and tip someone else no need to even set up a llet you can use sat all you nt just from your own tip get them and pas them on side note you can send private message to the bot and it will give your balance or a code to send sat to or receive sat via lightning llet just using the link on the bot reply to tip type lntip or any number higher than it will tip the person you are replying to if you 't have the fund available in your account for the tip then the bot creates a lightning invoice that you can pay using lightning llet use with a llet setting up a lightning llet and adding sat to the bot a great guide from double lr tip him if he post in comment i use muun too so you are in luck it work a very small bit different than you think i am on a phone so this is what i just did to transfer sat from the tipbot balance to my muun llet very easy you ll see prior to doing this you must have the llet fully set up get your seed phrase word aka your key and write them down and keep them safe then do the rescue emergency pdf thing too it s pretty easy and worth the hassle of figuring it out after that open muun and select receive at the top there are two option button select lightning and the screen will change to a lightning address at the bottom you will see invoice setting select that and you will see a button to add an amount and an expiry time for the invoice press add and enter the amount you nt to withdraw from the tipbot balance press confirm and the invoice will change again to the address that represents what you just created an invoice for the amount of sat you entered press copy and the invoice will be copied to your clipboard in your phone open reddit and find a tipbot message it ha the blue link in it you see it every time a tip is given press withdraw and it will create the dm format for you once you learn the format very simple you can create it from scratch like a normal dm but the blue link doe this for you until you learn the format well enough to create it on your own on the dm page created by the blue link there is a spot that say put_invoice_here delete only that simple phrase and then paste in to the same spot and your invoice you copied earlier will appear the line that say withdraw need to stay where it is press send open muun a fast a you can and see if you can beat the withdral to your llet from reddit enjoy fellow redditor it seems like a lot but i m reality step will become step for you and step will also become one step for you so once you learn it it s basically two step lightning is badass enjoy fellow redditor general help some useful faq type information

you to send sat super fast and cheap what is a bot an automated service to help you 't worry about sending message to it a long a you 't change the word it's just like sending a command to a computer and it will return your answer privately do i need a llet perhaps not you can be given tip and then check your balance here on reddit and only tip others using your tip a great little circular community but then i do need a llet yes when you either have so many tip on your reddit ln bot account llet that you nt to withdraw them fully or use them in the real world then you will need a llet or if you have no tip and nt to tip then you will need a llet what's a reddit ln bot account llet the clever people who made this tip bot made it so you automatically get a little llet just for use with the bot only attached to your username that the bot can use to track your tip and balance smart what's a lightning llet a lightning llet probably an app that you can install the app allows transfer of bitcoin sat to any other llets great for buying stuff in location that accept bitcoin sending bitcoin or sat to your friend l and for sending sat to fill your tip account where do i get a

1,how big wa the ftx scam i ll preface by saying i m not an ftx user but i do have my theory about what happened the fact that money s being sent to alameda instead of ftx to me mean the scam s planned from the beginning what im unsure of is whether the money s stolen or lost on bad trade im guessing it s both i have some suspicion i nna throw around here i figured this would be the best place to get feedback on it the main thing i feel people reading this need to understand is i believe sam planned to use ftx a a crypto slush fund which lead me to the following a i understand it ftx had a lot of derivative future and leveraged product these product track the price of an underlying asset and can be complex to me it s quite a stretch of the imagination that sbf s actually taking all of the underlying position that you could take on ftx if he s gambling with everyone s money anyy i t even know how you d accomplish some of it in crypto so s that a scam too any ftx user on here that can comment my question is essentially do you think sbf s letting people place bet on the price of token without there actually being any underlying transaction cause if that s the case then it make sense why he deleted everyone s balance and trade history and i m also wondering if you were able to go on ftx with a small amount of collateral place a ridiculously leveraged bet get it right and cash out your money whose money s that got cashed out

1,key exfiltration how a signing device could leak a private key blockstream published an article about how a signing device might leak user private key the premise of this attack is straightforrd a hardre llet can leak the user s secret key by carefully constructing it signature since the compromise happens during signature generation rather than key generation even if the user verifies that her key were produced from strong randomness e g by generating her seed word by rolling dice and then importing them into multiple llets to ensure they produce the same address it is still possible to execute the attack the solution blockstream is proposing to this isn't quite right though it involves trust in the manufacturer and trust in the softre if that softre is closed source the solution to this is much more obvious than this novel attempt to secure against it the solution is open source softre that is easy to compile and flash onto the device and open source hardre that is easy to verify via a visual inspection against a reference like i said in a comment to a post before http i'm not going to talk about particular exploit because i believe defending against the hacker methodology itself is the best thing user can do especially when exploit are known to attacker but not to defender 't let this scare you ay from using bitcoin just get better at your own pace keep your stack at the size you know how to defend a larger stack ha justifies a more paranoid threat model

1,bitcoin always win even if the medium talk shit about it i recently stumbled upon the meme 'is this good for bitcoin yes ' and i believe it's a phenomenal meme it's so simple yet incredibly clever that's it that's the meme this meme say it all it doesn't matter if people talk shit about bitcoin what matter is that people talk about bitcoin because whether they talk positively or negatively bitcoin will be mentioned and every mention yield areness in marketing this is called a 'brand touch point' it take a long time for a new product until mass adoption happens new customer first need to hear about get interested research and finally make a purchase decision that doesn't happen over night the first step before anyone can start his bitcoin journey is therefore areness you 't start your bitcoin journey unless you see bitcoin in the news or hear friend talk about it the diagram show that every sale is offset by attention interest desire and conviction from frank hutchinson dukesmith editor of salesmanship a bitcoin enthusiast we tend to forget that we all started at zero at some point do you remember when you first heard about bitcoin you probably read an article that s shitting on bitcoin and you dismissed it you see it's just normal that bad news is part of the journey but bad news is good news and here is why the purchase funnel feel like it ha been around forever it is in every marketing course book and is mentioned at least once in every client meeting so when a client exclaimed it feel like we ve used this thing for year i decided to check turn out we have well marketer anyy year to be ect whether you call it the customer funnel sale funnel marketing funnel aida or just funnel each serf the same purpose the funnel show how a customer ultimately make the decision to buy a product source bad news is good news because it still help bitcoin at the very beginning of the funnel is areness and bad news help to make people are that bitcoin exists the streisand effect is a name for the phenomenon in which attempt to hide censor or prevent access to something have the opposite result the unintended consequence of drawing far more attention to that thing here is a hypothetical emple of the streisand effect someone post an embarrassing photo of a celebrity online around people see it the celebrity take legal action to enforce it removal upon learning of the legal action the medium cover the story a a result million of people seek out and view the photo the upside the celebrity will see the number of follower increase and his or her popularity rise following the news the streisand effect is a great emple of how trying to hide or prevent access to something can actually end up drawing more attention to it this phenomenon can be seen in many different context but one of the most interesting emples is the y that the medium often try to talk shit about bitcoin at first glance it might seem like the media's constant criticism of bitcoin would be bad for bitcoin after all negative news story can often have a negative impact on people's perception of a particular topic however when it come to bitcoin the opposite seems to be true every time the medium talk shit about bitcoin it seems to only end up drawing more attention to it and increasing it popularity so let the hater come they all feed the algo

1,the lightning network is fast but it kinda suck i ran my own lightning node for over year so i have so personal experience with it and the model work is it's simplicity but i strongly believe that it suck the entire channel system suck the main reason is how shit is it to actually have a node to spend unless you have a ton of sat to create a big channel to a place you will use frequently you are gonna end up needing to reopen channel all the time and won't be any better off than using on chain this lead to the use of service like loop and those are both expensive and risky if you look at the trend too centralization in lightning is overt where big node grow bigger over time because they provide the least amount of jump and the most usefulness for most spend user i honestly 't think the channel model is going to survive contact with hyperbitcoinization
1,how are btc trading pair so well linked with each other this is my first post my apology if i post it in the wrong section my understanding is that each btc trading pair is a market of it own according to coingecko today's h trading volume in binance were an emple for btc usdt for btc busd for btc euri s wondering how come btc eur share almost identical volatility to the above two pair granted it trading volume is so low compared to theirs let assume that i have enough bitcoin with a current market value of mln euro and i go ahead and sell all my bitcoin for euro with a market order i will not receive mln euro since i have to instantly cover a lot of buy limit order and bitcoin price will most likely drop due to my purchase but in the end i will be left with a sum composed only of euro how will the exchange proceed to cover my order will it accept buy limit order with other currency a well and instantly convert them to euro or will my order instantly create arbitrage between btc pair in the given exchange

1,creating wallet offline is a vulnerability when using super computer in the future hello isn't it quite simple to hack bitcoin by simply generating trillion of random llets offline and checking their content simultaneously you just rely on luck to generate an already existing llet containing x amount of btc it doesn't matter how well secured locked the random victim's llet is since you are making an unencrypted unlocked copy of it i know the possibility are huge but i am taking about utilizing a super computer or just ddos attack with million of computer even if this is now very unlikely to work such attack can be having a huge scalability ha satoshi nakamoto thought about this in the long term i e year from now if someone succeeds in such an attack it would be devastating for btc you could argue that the attack is y more likely but it's a public attack so it wouldn't help stealing a llet with literally zero hacking can be a genuine y to fight off any fraudulent claim in court since the attacked completely legally obtained the llet via the official app even now quantum computer can be given to kid to do whatever calculation they nt just fyi
1,catalyst for bitcoin so from what i've gathered there's multiple catalyst for bitcoin price next year despite a looming recession which is a fact at this point first one is the halvening obvious by the end of there should be the peak and preceding that hopefully a long uprd trend tords a minimum of k per bitcoin according to model that have a historical price accuracy of bitcoins value should peak at around m per bitcoin in average recession last for around month so by the time this one will be over bitcoins price should be around k at the end of next year beginning of second one is the gaap accounting standard next year this law will be improved so that company that hold digital asset on their balance sheet will be able to write them at their fair value currently if the price go down in value but jump back up again company have to write down the value of the digital asset and can't mark it up starting from next year it will be different which apparently ha been a deal breaker for institutional investor in the past third one is the capital inflow of traditional investor like investment bank pension fund central bank small big country and different fund currently holding digital asset in their portfolio is considered to be risky due to the absence of regulation transparency public disclosings from the beginning of next year january the united state congress will be having a session where the sec and congress will both fight over which entity get to set the rule they both seem to be in a hurry to be the first one which is a positive for crypto investor a the institution feel safer to invest the capital inflow should be somewhere around trillion usd for the price to reach k at the end of next year current price would have to quadruple so approximately trillion usd would be sufficient total amount of asset held by mutual fund in the u is trillion usd germany ha trillion and uk brazil and switzerland collectively own trillion usd that's close to trillion if of this would go to bitcoin it price would quadruple another scenario would be where we would consider the multiplier effect x of investing in the stock market in which only billion of capital inflow from institutional investor would be necessary to reach a trillion market cap x billion usd trillion i included switzerland because it central bank ha said it's interested in acquiring bitcoin there's a few other potential catalyst in the future that might shape the perception of cryptocurrencies to a positive in the coming year big country like iran russia adopting cryptocurrencies to evade sanction and the pilot of cbdcs also ukraine is one of the largest bitcoin holder so there are multiple concrete thing to look forrd to in next year and especially the year after despite the coming recession the biggest factor for a long bear phase are imo rising oil price and interest rate until the end of next year in addition to that revolving and non revolving credit are at an all time high while the saving rate of american is at an all time low if the recession will last around month it should be a relatively sound timing for the price to shoot up to k per bitcoin during the third picture is metcalf's law which predicts the value to be minimum k by it's not a delicious a the other two model but still decent considering the fact that it would be the minimum value according to this model the value would be minimum m usd during and hover above m until it reach during next decade these are just some thought thing i've gathered hope someone find it useful cheer

1,messing up at robosats hi everyone i tried out bisq and it s quite successful i made some buy made some sell and it seems like thing work for the most part it ha some bug but nothing that doe not eventually get resolved i had trouble figuring out robosats i'm letting you know my mistake so that you 't make them it s probably because i 't know how to use the lightning network so well i tried using electrum with their trolines here's how it went i got tor and figured out how to run it i went to the robosats website and found the tor link i went to the robosats site and i actually properly saved my bot i set up a small electrum troline channel for something small like btc i found a deal that i thought s reasonable and clicked on it i sent them my security deposit through a lightning invoice now i have three hour i then tried to set up a few different half sized btc channel that would not make the whole payment i didn't know that this s a problem i then learned through experience that the only y to pay the full invoice s to use a full sized channel that would cover the whole payment i made a new larger channel that would easily cover the whole payment i clicked pay for this lightning invoice three time and it failed three time each of those time the troline tried to send eight time i lost my security deposit i'm in the process of closing my lightning channel possible analysis electrum is not that good for lightning trolines are not that good for transaction above btc i needed a y to practice these thing and could not find one any thought on what else we can learn

1,what's lnurl and bolt a you might know the lightning network started back in march and serf a payment layer to scale the transaction speed of the bitcoin network and reduce the cost per transaction at the same time due to the lack of liquidity it s really hard to actually send payment at the beginning while it became easier to participate in the network there are still challenge to solve in order to make it accessible for the broader mass one of the main problem is the need to create an invoice each time you nt to receive a payment from a ux perspective this is absolutely horrible lnurl and bolt try to solve some of these issue which i will try to explain in the following part lnurl what ectly is that lnurl is a stack of simple protocol for coordinating information needed to make payment over the lightning network using http the full list of lnurl protocol piece can be found here but i'm just going to go into a few core us that overlap with bolt the three core feature of the lnurl protocol are defined a lnurl auth where a public key can be used to log in to a service lnurl pay where a llet can ping a server through a static qr code and retrieve an invoice lnurl withdraw where a llet can ping a server and request that the server pay an invoice provided by the lletfor using the authentication protocol the server provides a randomly generated number which the user's llet sign with a newly generated key after the server retrieves the signed randomly generated number the key get saved and can be used for future logins the invoice request functionality is a y to provide information to a user about a payment they wish to make in a format that is not an invoice this provides a description of the payment the minimum and maximum amount the service expects to be paid and a url for the llet from which to request an actual invoice from here the llet display this information to the user allowing them to set a final amount and request an invoice after sending the invoice request and receiving one back from the server the llet verifies that the amount match what the user set and pay the invoice note this feature is already available if you're using phoenix llet of satoshi or bluellet muun doe not support it a of now december the withdral request work by pinging the service and receiving in response a description a url to send an invoice to a random string and a minimum amount and maximum amount that can be withdrawn after filling in the appropriate value the llet return an invoice to the server and if it is valid and within the amount parameter the service pay the invoice the lnurl authenticate protocol can be used in addition to this to ensure that only the intended user can successfully withdraw using the lnurl link common use case would be if you nt to withdraw your sat from a lightning service such a the lntipbot here on reddit or the lntot on telegram bolt why do we need it the term bolt is the acronym for b asis o f l ightning t echnology you can compare these to the bips bitcoin improvement proposal which are design document for introducing feature or information to bitcoin the bip a amended ha since become the standard y of formally communicating idea about potential bitcoin improvement a mentioned at the beginning of this post there are some ux flaw which need to be addressed to understand the problem bolt attempt to solve it is mandatory to have a look at the current standard which is used to create invoice bolt invoice generated by the bolt standard consist of three main component the destination where the payment is supposed to be sent to public key of the node the amount which is about to be transferred a hash which represents the payment secret the main problem of bolt invoice is that they can only be used once and therefore need to be created in realtime the creation of the invoice lead to the publishing of the payment secret and is therefore unsecure if you would create an invoice with the same secret someone could fraudulently request money due to the fact that the secret is known this make the usage of qr code invoice for ations or other use case impossible what is bolt bolt offer an attempt to achieve some of the core functionality that lnurl provides without requiring the use of a web server an offer encodes the data necessary to reach a node to request an invoice to make a payment either a node _id or a blinded path the last few hop in an onion route pre computed and encrypted to that node using onion message it also can encode a minimum amount for a payment the currency being paid in an expiry time and minimum maximum quantity number for purchasing multiple item this is all of the information necessary to fetch an actual invoice from the node that issued the offer someone who nt to pay an invoice doe so over onion message one of the core feature of bolt it allows node to make a direct end to end encrypted connection between each other that doe not involve a lightning channel just like lightning payment these can be used to onion route message after obtaining an offer a payer will use the information encoded in it to send an invoice _request message the creator of the offer will then respond back with an actual invoice there is also support for generating unique per user offer that allow the receiver to request a payment from the creator of the offer similar to lnurl's withdral request feature bolt invoice commit to a unique payer key this can be used in the case of issuing refund to prove you are the person who actually paid the invoice this can also be used in combination with the withdral offer to guarantee that only the correct person can succeed in getting an invoice paid by the creator a opposed to whoever is able to get a copy of the offer what's best both lnurl and bolt enable a more user friendly y for paying or getting paid on the lightning network while lnurl sits on the application level bolt provides a solution on proctocol level where the new offer do neither require a web server tl certificate nor a domain and provide a higher level of protection than lnurl using blinded path the bolt offer allow the confidentiality of the node id which additionally enriches the privacy it's important to say both solution can exist simultaneously while online shop and other service provider operate a web server anyy lnurl is a good

1,bitcoins market cap doe not need to go up there s no entitlement to any future of possible cash flow therefore there is no necessity that market cap must be worth some arbitrary value bitcoin seems to be worth more akin to artwork a an important piece of history that people find subjective value that said other currency are experiencing extreme downside volatility and it would be impractical and near impossible to buy physical commodity to entirely store wealth and if one were to pile into stock then one risk overpaying the intrinsic value of cash flow i find real estate in the u s overall a much better investment that can generate cash flow but think bitcoin ha an investment case for more totalitarian government or a a hedge against u s legislation some counterpoint to consider to mindless bull echo chamber that believe bitcoin is the best investment with no risk long term any more than a few of btc seems to be complete greed diversification save insures against complete loss
1,for what it's worth these are the bitcoin wallet i recommend depending on your level of knowledge do whatever you want with this information my humble opinion only feel free to disagree here they are level muun llet mobile recommended for people that are starting out and 't have much knowledge about mnemonic seed or how bitcoin work user experience is incredibly minimalistic almost idiot proof backup process is intuitive a well come with lightning network integrated behind the scene fully open source level green llet mobile next level choice for those that are regularly stacking sat and have more understanding of how bitcoin work very modern ux and easy to understand ha the ability to manage several llets passphrases connect with tor connect to your own node link to hardre device like trezor etc i personally feel comfortable having up to btc here but that's me your threshold might be btc or lower or it might be higher on chain only no lightning fully open source level bitbox bitcoin only edition hardre once you're ready for a hardre llet and have more money this one is my favorite the people behind this llet are very transparent and security conscious it's one of the very few llets that protect against the covert nonce channel attack which is a huge plus for me the device is not difficult to use and the companion app is intuitive a well everything is fully open source the only thing that i 't like is that their default backup option is an sd card i prefer to discard the sd card and write the seed word instead level seedsigner hardre this is the best option in my opinion it is completely air gapped and us generic hardre which drastically reduces the probability of a backdoor the only downside is that it's a diy do it yourself llet you need to buy the part and assemble it yourself not the ideal option for of people however if you're tech savvy and understand bitcoin this one is awesome fully open source level multisignature and air gapped laptop advanced this one is worth mentioning you will come across people that nt to minimize trust a much a possible they will say hardre llets are not secure enough and will point you tords yeticold com or glacierprotocol org this is probably the most secure option but it come with a big tradeoff which is complexity consider this option only if you know what you're doing and have a lot of money you need to secure that's it hope you found this information helpful p there are a couple of mobile llets worth mentioning which are phoenix llet and samourai llet phoenix is a pure lightning network llet and samourai is a privacy focused llet both are great for what they do in my opinion worth checking them out

1,recommending that the only way to use and hold bitcoin is via an airgapped laptop or via a narrow spectrum of hardware wallet is counter productive i'm a bitcoin stacker and holder since no shitcoins i'm a firm believer that bitcoin will usher in a new era of monetary stability in the medium to long term future i lurk on this sub everyday and never post or comment but i dusted off this auto made account just to create this one post and then i'm gone again there ha been a recent outpouring of hate tord some of the most popular hardre llets eg ledger and trezor these seam to be perpetrated by a few very outspoken commenters but i'm concerned their narrow minded view could gain traction basically they posit that the only y to hold bitcoin is via an airgapped laptop or if you must a coldcard anything le than this is akin to shilling shitcoins because hw llets like trezor and ledger allow shitcoin storage we need to be realistic here if we are talking about resetting the financial system then this mean everyone will need to be able to use and store bitcoin safely are you really proposing that everyone who nt to store their bitcoin install open source linux figure out something like glacier protocol roll dice a thousand time and only use micro sd card to store psbts like seriously not everyone is a cypherpunk what about people in the third world trying to outrun hyperinflation coldcards only come on y'all the size of your stack and the duration of your time preference will dictate your security measure if you are holding lt of your wealth in bitcoin i would think trezor or ledger would be fine that's how i started out when my stack s small a your stack grows and becomes a larger portion of your wealth you likely should upgrade your security measure i use a multi vendor geographically distributed multi sig solution now that bitcoin is a more substantial portion of my wealth i won't compromise on shitcoins it's bitcoin or bust but we do need to aggressively fight against this narrow minded point of view that coldcards or airgapped laptop are the only solution for storage cluttering up this sub with this viewpoint is going to freak out people new to the space
1,bitcoin fundamental did you see how many people hurt themselves this cycle last cycle every cycle countless user are led in by scam that pretend to be innovative and revolutionary and related to bitcoin and the platform that make themselves vulnerable supporting them even indirectly scam that are on the same platform beside bitcoin that are on the same llets a bitcoin that have the same name a bitcoin cryptocurrency that use the same revolutionary technology of blockchain this is the bear winter it's on back of one of the shitcoin collapse for the age with mtgox it's time to clean this culture up a bit and get back to the bitcoin fundamental and see if we a a community can lay the ground work for a safe and informed bull spring run a node do not use shitcoin llets and service alys hold your key 't trust verify that's the kind of adoption i'm interested in if you nt to know how take all the time you need and inform yourself at one of many place but do so with a critical mind think who am i trusting and is it really that much work to eliminate that trust bitcoin isn't going anywhere price doesn't matter half these people are trying to rob you and no one is a interested in securing your money or platform built on money a you are just take your time let's verify more and trust le let's disassociate from crypto and stablecoins or whatever that culture ha become let's try to spread the highest quality method knowledge and business not necessarily the most accessible and convenient not the one paying u the most in yield or sponsorship 'm not under any illusion we're goin to save anyone from themselves and it'll never be close to perfect but we can all do a lot better for ourselves and the people arriving in the community tomorrow than the low standard and advice regularly shilled in here than the company we a a bitcoin community regularly enable
1,bitcoin security budget hi all anyone here is a bit worried about the bitcoin security budget i am a bitcoin lover and i feel like it ha the potential to change the world economy and society anyy recently i heard about the risk that could happen in the future about bitcoin stability it is an issue linked to the miner and their profit right now they get btc per block plus the transaction fee wich is something like btc next halving should not be a problem since it will be btc and so the halving after with a rerd of btc miner right now can easily pay off the electricity and hardre to mine bitcoin and they will do it without any problem in the coming year with profit but what about in the next or year you would answer that the price of btc would be so high that even the smallest amount of satoshi could be enough for the miner to do their job but we t know that for sure 't we plus bitcoin is influenced by the nasdaq and sp and by the government and central bank decision and ultimately by the world economy and it stability imagine a period of a big recession statistically likely to happen in the next decade what happens if the price of btc drop below the minum price which will make miner stop doing their job since they get le and le btc every year that minimum price is going to raise i'm sorry for my english i'm italian btw i 't nt to fud this thread i just nt you to explain to me why i can stay relaxed and keep to stack satoshi

1,bitcoin supply artificially inflated i've been a btc bull since and have been hodling since i've self studied market for year and with all the different catalyst lining up have had a hard time understanding why the btc usd price ha been artificially suppressed specifically with all of the macro event fundamental advance made the conclusion that i'm coming to is manufactured paper bitcoin i'm sure that most of you who read this understand that for every a bank take in they can loan it out x this work for bank since there is confidence driven by education indoctrination mainstream medium and lack of critical thinking a bank run on a large bank would completely destroy it a fast a ftx collapsed i believe this scenario is happening behind the scene of a few other large current exchange until you've redeemed your coin and control your key the bitcoin that you think that you have in your account can be bought and sold to many other people simultaneously therefore the scarcity factor is invalidated the bad actor need to all be chewed up and spit out this is very good for the ecosystem i believe we will see a few more big exchange fold before the end of the bear only the bad actor will fall due to poor risk management and overleveraging their balance sheet using paper bitcoin protect yourself against the purge and self custody a i would hate to see honest pleb impacted like the one impacted by celsius ftx blockfi voyager etc aggressively removing coin from these exchange is the only y to keep them honest thought

1,how i think i know bitcoin will at some point gain mass adoption there is one distinguish characteristic i believe that every non bitcoiner posse and that is a lack of a deep dive into bitcoin ill informed parroting surface level detraction of bitcoin the asset and network bitcoiners on the other hand have e the research and to a certain degree understand the potential of bitcoinam i wrong have any of you had a real discussion with a non bitcoiner where you can tell they have researched bitcoin in depth they have resarched it and say i think this ha no chance of gaining mass adoption becuase that's the conclusion you must come to to not own some bitcoin the value of bitcoin if mass adoption were to happen would be massive so even if there is an infinitesimal chance mass adoption will occur you would still logically own some bitcoin to not own bitcoin you need more than reasonable doubt that it won't work if there is any reasonable doubt than you got to own at least a little bitcoin to me and this could be wrong and more a reflection of confirmation bias but the well informed i would assume would be right more often than those who 't even take the time to understand a topic

1,impact of more halvings i seem to remember every halving being approached with some trepidation a to how the miner would adapt historically price go up and more hash power get turned on can this happen another time in my simple understanding each halving will double the cost of production for most commodity the price will reach equilibrium near the cost or production assuming more halvings assuming a current cost of about per btc which i think is a low estimate this put the bitcoin cost of production at x or over t per btc in this seems kind of absurd especially since it assumes the difficulty and hash rate stay constant to what they are today in given the trajectory of hash rate it should be safe to assume the difficulty will be much higher in than in this would mean the cost of production is even higher than t and the market price would need to be higher than t btc to support this that would put the market cap at m x t or quintillion again an absurd number a this is in t odays dollar inflation would make this even higher another possibility is that the hash rate reach a maximum and then start to drop off if the difficulty is too high miner will have to drop out of the race and reduce the difficulty and cost to be under the market price this would lead to centralization or at least a reduction in the number of entity controlling the mining hash rate i understand that at some point most of the block rerds will be in transaction fee but how doe this impact the overall economics of cost of production the fee are currently running around of the block rerd though when the network is busy it ha spiked to from what i can tell the fee will stay relatively the same in absolute btc earned but the coinbase rerd get reduced with the halvings this seems like it would put a cap on cost of mining a block thats something like x what it is today so this would put cost of block around m and since that's for btc today that would cap it around m cap to btc more realistic but not sure the math hold up

1,which halvening will not have a significant impact on the liquidity of global market i know it's not a binary yes no answer but a best i can tell there are around btc moved on the mainchain on average per day please correct me with a source if i'm wrong presently there are newly mined btc appearing every day how much is traded on exchange is really hard to confident calculate so much bot sh trading but maybe the best y to look at it is that the majority of the k is going to from an exchange although sure some is otp and some is internal shuffling or coinjoining or whatever so when the new coin supply drop from daily down to daily it will likely have some impact on overall market liquidity miner gotta pay bill and sell some but at what point doe the new supply become insignificant to the price movement once it's a day in year or year after that

1,'the drought' is coming the drought theory the balance on exchange ha been steadily declining over the the past year or two if the trend continues in year or so the major exchange will have little to no bitcoin left to facilitate trading and meet the need of the buyer factor that will likely shorten the timeline we will have another having event in the current price just under k and likely to decrease in the short term it is becoming increasingly easy for people cross the world to purchase somefactors that could lenhen the timeline off exchange bitcoin being blacklisted by major country if this 'first great bitcoin drought' occurs the price is likely to increase substantially in a short period of time i think this will be an order of magnitude bigger than previous bull run because there s alys enough bitcoin available via cexs and dexs while i do acknowledge that there will be increased selling pressure when it hit higher dollar value i think it is unlikely this outpaces buying pressure in the long run thought

1,a block reward diminish how will the network be incentivized to remain secure a possibly stupid question about mining incentive and how it relates to future network security if the following are true the overall strenh of the network can be computed in dollar term by determining the cost to acquire of the network hashrate the more costly it is to obtain network hashrate the more secure it is the network hashrate will be proportional roughly to the profitability of mining time some coefficient for how efficient the present day hardre is eg if btc per day are rerded now then it's worth investing x per th s on mining equipment then in the future a block rerds approach zero won't it becoming increasingly le profitable to mine and thus won't network hashrate stall or dip and thus won't it becoming increasingly cheap to acquire network hashrate a an extreme emple if the rerd is only btc day mining hardre would become quite cheap and it'd be easy to buy half of the hashrate it seems that in the future a block rerds diminish in order for the network hashrate to be prohibitively expensive btc would need to have astronomically high price or transaction fee would need to be astronomically high it seems a though through virtue of halving block rerds bitcoin is naturally pushed tords becoming a le secure over time or b exponentially expensive to use both of these tendency would seem to perpetuate a death spiral in the utility a le secure le valuable and b expensive to transact le utility what am i missing a this relates to centralization of mining here's another aside seemingly bitmain could right now probably single handedly manufacture enough hashrate to own the network in relatively short order they are more incentivized to sell hardre for now however in the future when mining hardre is unable to be profitably sold because the block rerds are not valuable it seems a though their incentive could shift tords simply owning the network and cashing out

1,best counterargument available to the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard i'm not sure how ectly i began down this bitcoin austrian economics rabbit hole but about a week ago it led me to two fantastic yet very distressing book the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard both written by saifedean ammous i'm kind of assuming that these book are well known amongst the bitcoin community i apologize if that's not actually the case the gist is basically fiat money trash bitcoin hard money good although it obviously go into a lot more depth than that frankly i have felt very out of my depth reading these book and trying to think about economics this past week or so i am able to read the argument presented and find them compelling and see the logic in them but i am left somewhat frazzled by them like i 't know what to make of them ammous doe a good job of putting thing simply for a bitcoin neophyte like myself but for some reason i still struggle to fully comprehend everything i find nothing wrong with ammous' core argument and honestly i'm kind of alarmed by that is this everyone's response to reading these book what do mainstream economist who read them have to say about them for me to be like okay he's right and go about my life i have to think pretty much everyone in government is clueless which isn't that crazy i suppose but i still feel a need to seek out some sort of counterargument to these book before i make that conclusion anyys i've been looking with not much success for some sort of response from the mainstream pov to the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard preferably one presenting counterargument to ammous' various point any suggestion

1,the use for bitcoin mining in stabilizing energy market is very interesting what we are beginning to see with energy production in place like kazakhstan and te is using bitcoin mining a a sort of financial battery to store the value of produced energy digitally and then to use this value to trade between energy producer based on need this will make energy market more efficient and make energy grid more resilient you can produce at below peak time and then buy at peak time with the bitcoin mined at other time you can produce a sellable asset with ste energy and energy resource to offset the cost of production this is fantastic but a le talked about subsequent effect of this that i possibly naively foresee is the increasing competition for energy by consumer v bitcoin miner often the energy producer themselves a time will come if this continues when an energy producer will ask what's more profitable mining or selling the energy to consumer and when that happens the price of energy will begin to be dictated by the price of bitcoin how much you pay for electricity will be tightly correlated with how much bitcoin can be harvested with that energy and how much in fiat it can be sold for once this happens bitcoin then becomes a sort of de facto reserve currency for bitcoin market the price of energy will become volatile a the price of bitcoin and it would make sense then to price energy directly in bitcoin bitcoin will become the unit of account in energy market once this happens i expect bitcoin to grow out of just the energy industry a a unit of account over time and begin to be used a a unit of account for more and more market since energy cost are so fundamental to the cost of most other thing this phenomenon we are seeing now the use of bitcoin mining to extract value from ste energy will directly lead to bitcoin being used a a unit of account worldwide perhaps i'm missing something but i 't think so

1,understanding why btc is valuable take a mind that ha a good grasp on what the world will look like in the future this need no argument for people in poor country because it's unfolding already a trustless payment system that requires no rd party is quite frankly an insane human accomishment if you t think so then you are selling yourself short of a very important history lesson hundred of them actually human have been trying to accomplish this since the beginning of time poor country are already seeing the benefit because it is improving their life these are fact that are indisputable so far however people who grew up swiping cc and listening to elite medium in rich modern country require a little more thought power to grasp why btc will slowly but surely become the money of choice it's clearly not impossible to grasp in a modern sense especially after reading a few book on the matter but i totally understand how buttcoin crew formed and why this is such a big misunderstanding of value that will take year and year to continue coming to fruition since the dawn of man anytime you introduce a better money into a civilization that better money will end up becoming the standard there is not other y to say that every money ever created prior to btc either required trusted physical storage or s controlled and issued by a central authority for the first time ever that's not true the reality is that we are not gaining any finacial freedom moving forrd none the needle is going the other y the value of usd and the other fiat that get tered down even more a a result of greed and power will become le and le valuable a they are held i will say i did not understand btc year ago i would have totally sided with the general unresearched public it's amazing what a few book on the history of money will do along with a few about btc itself i think this is going to be a very slow change but these thing happen slowly and it's based on progress and innovation beyond every problem not perfection of a globally accepted and purely trustless peer to peer monetary system in a handful of year let's review in more year and see how different thing are considering there are more active llets and more indovidual whole coiner than ever before a of i'm excited to tch it unfold while being conservatively invested into what i think may be the best diversification vehicle of our life or maybe in history btc is the most appreciating asset of the last year

1,how to get cryptocurrencies circulating supply from the source hello i s wondering for a friend how to technically get cryptocurrencies circulating supply for the sake of simplicity for now i narrowed my focus on bitcoin bitcoin forked based altcoin the truth is the cryptocurrency node and it expose the value i'm looking for over the rpc api command gettxoutsetinfo so the probably most naive y would be but perhaps the most reliable to run node of each bitcoin and bitcoin forked based altcoin and later on query each of them you would agree that it's horrible running a bitcoin node is good and good for health though a it cost proper set _up deployment maintenance bandwith hosting computing blabla then i remembered every i think node when initiating use a dns seed the primary y to discover peer in the bitcoin network is to connect to a list of btc node that are previously connected however for the initial connection the node ha to use a publicly known dns feed to retrieve a list of ip address of long running stable node so it's available in the code directly and it's easily scalable under master src chainparams cpp then searching for vseeds unfortunately a gettxoutsetinfo is computed by the node with indexed data from the blockchain sync it mean it's also not available from the protocol perspective of course so having a list of a crypto node appart for a crawling job in my case look like a dead end then i though maybe i can fetch each node address and hope one misconfigured or expose it's node rpc api publicly a it is not standart to have it enable by default doe not seems realiable but i 't see another y i would be happy to hear any suggestion idea if you have

1,conversing with a fed advisor about bitcoin a friend of mine is a well known finance professor and advises the fed we hang out once a year for a few hour but never discussed bitcoin he ha alys thought it is trash worthless useless we hung out last week and he s interested this time in discussing bitcoin it didn't really get anywhere but i probably didn't do the best job in defending bitcoin the fact that he is a very prominent finance professor didn't make it easy today he sent me an opinion piece written by paul krugman that just came out yesterday which basically declares crypto to be dead yet again th time i can gather my thought properly before responding but i thought i would share them here in case anyone ha any comment on my response that could be helpful thank you for sending me this article i hate to parrot the same type of talking point that krugman hears but i do believe that krugman doesn't get it more to the point though no one ha explained it to him because what is written in his article is mostly unrelated to what enthusiast would talk about first forget about anything non bitcoin second and the main point inflation is generally speaking and in the last year a horrible thing if inflation come about from positive economic activity then fine but if you sum up all of the inflation over the last year in the usa i am guessing it ha been a huge negative on overall society this is a claim that i am making unverified by me if i am wrong about this then i am very misinformed and would gladly relinquish a lot of my support for bitcoin inflation is the main problem that bitcoin is trying to solve satoshi nakomoto probably said it best in a few word a possible the root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work the central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency but the history of fiat currency is full of breach of that trust bank must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically but they lend it out in f of credit bubble with barely a fraction in reserve we have to trust them with our privacy trust them not to let identity thief drain our account their massive overhead cost make micropayments impossible satoshi's point above is about the debasing of fiat currency his point is fractional reserve lending why is fractional reserve lending a problem seems to have worked all these year except that it hasn't and in the bank had to be bailed out with u taxpayer footing the bill in the short term and the long term you will notice that krugman's article state nothing about the above and that's why he doesn't get it this is what bitcoin is all about but the most natural follow up question is how doe bitcoin solve the above problem why bitcoin why not rock or seashell or stuffed animal that is another conversation qar

1,fiat value ironacally change and coin are likely the most valuable form of any fiat currency due to the nature of the material and the time and effort it take to produce it compared to paper or plastic in some case the government are acctually losing money just by creating it which s the reasoning behind canada abaning the penny however with bitcoin million sat will alys equal one bitcoin regardless of the various size amount that acumulate to the whole
1,bitcoin or cash what's everyone's primary reason motive for getting involved in bitcoin is it for sovereign money or the value of your money most people sell a 'price go up' are you one of those people or are you a hoarder por que no los do
1,mass adoption doe not mean mass ownership many people reject the idea of mass bitcoin adoption because they believe that the majority of the population is not going to be buying btc or they simply believe that most people are not tech savvy enough to do so what these people fail to understand is that mass adoption doe not mean mass ownership during the gold standard most people owned little to no gold yet trough their currency they had adopted a gold based system and had indirect exposure to gold mass adoption doe not mean everyone will have a llet app on their phone and a hardre llet at home it mean that your pension fund will own bitcoin your insurance plan will have a allocation your workplace ha a small just in case allocation on their balance sheet the purchase you do at eleven in your local currency will be settled using the lightning network instead of the old system from visa mastercard the app you use to send money to your friend to split the uber cost will be using lightning your local and state government will quietly own some too either directly or trough some financial vehicle like a trust or an etf most people will live their life a normal but the service that make their world go around will be using magic internet money and they probably will not even know it the only clue will be that they are somehow better off financially than before the reason why all these service will adopt bitcoin is simple greed they will save money on every transaction and they will most likely outperform anyone who doesn't hold any sat
1,btc shouldn't be digital gold just a simple and direct truth bitcoin is promote by the community a digital gold aka a store of value but this sn't satoshi's purpose in the white paper hardly anyone us it for it intended purpose and that's a a decentralized currency doe nobody see the irony dilemma in transforming bitcoin into a tradable asset in order to make money off the gain rather than distributing it a a form of exchange

1,doe bitcoins rapid price drop actually increase adoption overtime working out a theory that bitcoin s rapid price decline and rise are actually good for adoption the rise is obvious it pull people in but the rapid fall also keep a lot of people in because of the sunk cost fallacy and when price start rising again they ve usually e a lot more research and have a different hodler mentality few admit it but most buy before doing much research at all they just chase green candle do you think bitcoin s extreme volatility even the downside ha actually helped increase adoption curious if anyones e any thinking about this the huge bull market aren t really the focus they obviously fuel adoption but ha the rapid downside played a bigger role than people think
1,paper bitcoin and price suppression so i know btc btc and the price shouldn't matter etc however is it not super easy for the bank and government to coordinate with one another to print and borrow amongst one another to buy bitcoin and dump it a they see fit the value of bitcoin climbing _too_ rapidly is a legitimate threat to the people in power because all of a sudden you have likely dissident with a decent sum of money to compete against those closest to the money printer we see the amount of money laundered in ukraine and ftx and also the recent death of newly wealthy crypto millionaire is quite a telling sign would this not be a significant drag on the price discovery of bitcoin

1,european central bank say bitcoin is dying first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win we are clearly in the fight you phase http the value of bitcoin peaked at usd in november before falling to usd by mid june since then the value ha fluctuated around usd for bitcoin proponent the seeming stabilization signal a breather on the y to new height more likely however it is an artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance and this s already foreseeable before ftx went bust and sent the bitcoin price to well below usd bitcoin is rarely used for legal transactionsbitcoin s created to overcome the existing monetary and financial system in the pseuymous satoshi nakamoto published the concept since then bitcoin ha been marketed a a global decentralised digital currency however bitcoin's conceptual design and technological shortcoming make it questionable a a mean of payment real bitcoin transaction are cumbersome slow and expensive bitcoin ha never been used to any significant extent for legal real world transaction in the mid s the hope that bitcoin's value would inevitably rise to ever new height began to dominate the narrative but bitcoin is also not suitable a an investment it doe not generate cash flow like real estate or dividend like equity cannot be used productively like commodity or provide social benefit like gold the market valuation of bitcoin is therefore based purely on speculation speculative bubble rely on new money flowing in bitcoin ha also repeatedly benefited from f of new investor the manipulation by individual exchange or stablecoin provider etc during the first f are well documented but le so the stabilising factor after the supposed bursting of the bubble in spring big bitcoin investor have the strongest incentive to keep the euphoria going big bitcoin investor have the strongest incentive to keep the euphoria going at the end of isolated company began to promote bitcoin at corporate expense some venture capital vc firm are also still investing heavily despite the ongoing crypto winter vc investment in the crypto and blockchain industry totalled usd billion a of mid july regulation can be misunderstood a approvallarge investor also fund lobbyist who push their case with lawmaker and regulator in the u alone the number of crypto lobbyist ha almost tripled from in to in their name sometimes read like a who's who of u regulator but lobbying activity need a sounding board to have an impact indeed lawmaker have sometimes facilitated the influx of fund by supporting the supposed merit of bitcoin and offering regulation that gave the impression that crypto asset are just another asset class yet the risk of crypto asset are undisputed among regulator in july the financial stability board fsb called for crypto asset and market to be subject to effective regulation and supervision commensurate with the risk they pose along the doctrine of same risk same regulation however legislation on crypto asset ha sometimes been slow to ratify in recent year and implementation often lag behind moreover the different jurisdiction are not proceeding at the same pace and with the same ambition while the eu ha agreed on a comprehensive regulatory package with the market in crypto asset regulation mica congress and the federal authority in the u have not yet been able to agree on coherent rule the belief that space must be given to innovation at all cost stubbornly persists the current regulation of cryptocurrencies is partly shaped by misconception the belief that space must be given to innovation at all cost stubbornly persists since bitcoin is based on a new technology dlt blockchain it would have a high transformation potential firstly these technology have so far created limited value for society no matter how great the expectation for the future secondly the use of a promising technology is not a sufficient condition for an added value of a product based on it the supposed sanction of regulation ha also tempted the conventional financial industry to make it easier for customer to access bitcoin this concern asset manager and payment service provider a well a insurer and bank the entry of financial institution suggests to small investor that investment in bitcoin are sound it s also worth noting that the bitcoin system is an unprecedented polluter first it consumes energy on the scale of entire economy bitcoin mining is estimated to consume electricity per year comparable to austria second it produce mountain of hardre ste one bitcoin transaction consumes hardre comparable to the hardre of two smartphones the entire bitcoin system generates a much e ste a the entire netherlands this inefficiency of the system is not a flaw but a feature it is one of the peculiarity to guarantee the integrity of the completely decentralised system

1,everything divided by million m money is a measuring stick we use to determine the value of all thing imagine you have a ruler where the distance between two tick s constantly changing that is what is happening with fiat money a we attempt to measure the value of thing in the world around u the standard we use to measure keep changing fiat ha no upper limit yet all thing around u are very much finite this lead to a lot of guesswork in the measurement and thing becoming very over under valued combine that with leverage credit and like a fulcrum with a long lever we can move something very heavy with a small amount of force then we have the valuation of thing that find their y wildly off there should be in relation to everything else the system even encourages this because there is potential for huge profit while this occurs it will alys come crashing back down though and someone is left holding the bag so what if we had a money with an actual upper limit that is essentially what the supply limit of million btc is an upper limit on how high we can value everything if we use bitcoin a a measuring stick the tick on the ruler will remain constant valuation can be made with le guesswork and capital can be allocated more rationally m is actually a bit misleading because infinity in this case is finite it is the world around u and while the universe may seem infinite what we actually have access to is limited if we do not find a y to properly value the world around u within it limit we are going to consume it all like an over leveraged position we will overshoot the actual value of our world maybe we already have and it will all come crashing down on u in the future

1,fast way to copy and repair a corrupted bitcoin blockchain suppose that after running reindex chainstate or reindex you find out the blockchain is corrupt but you got a also corrupt backup of the bitcoin blockchain including chainstate txindex block bitcoind will run just fine a it only check a limited number of block of the backup nbsp the following is a smart and fast y to copy the correct block from your local blockchain preferably to a new disk and only download corrupted block from other bitcoin node nbsp start another full node say bitcoind b on the same server different port and datadir next to your usual full node say bitcoind a then connect bitcoind b only to bitcoind a via an internal ip address which therefore serf block very fast because bitcoind a ha a corrupted blockchain it can't provide all the block so sometimes bitcoind b can't continue then add an external node say node c to node b via the bitcoin rpc addnode lt ip add command node b will then get a number of correct block from external node c but slower after some time remove node c via bitcoin rpc addnode lt ip remove followed by bitcoin rpc disconnectnode lt ip and node b will continue getting block only from node a very fast to connect node b only to node a add the following to b's bitcoin conf blocksonly listen port lt different port than a maxconnections addnode lt local ip address of a like dnsseed

1,possibility of 'bad actors' mining btc at a loss i promise this is not fud trying to have an honest discussion here and i use the term 'bad actors' very loosely here i just got e tching the latest 'what bitcoin did' podcast and part of it really stuck out in my head why is the btc hash rate at literal all time high when price is so low and miner are reaching a point where they are not profitable there s mention of 'concern that maybe nation state are starting to turn on machine and mine at whatever it cost to get around sanctions' for emple russia mining with their close to free natural gas so i started to think what if this s to actually happen there s some incentive either to simply just mine at a loss to get any amount of btc or to possibly attempt to attack the network could be for many reason to flat out mine at a loss this would lead to honest mining company turning off their machine because it s not profitable to run them different place pay different energy cost so obviously this would impact some country more than others i assume maybe wrongly that the u would be the first to be non profitable should the hash rate continue to climb while btc price continues to fall i know at least i thought a lot of the design of bitcoin is based on game theory that miner will continue to join the network a adoption and price increase what happens to this game theory in this case when a 'bad actor' could possibly have close to free energy what would happen in this scenario when some entity is mining even if there is no financial incentive to do so would the network difficulty drop enough for 'honest' miner to keep mining to secure the network in this case i assume place like kazakhstan have very cheap energy that would allow honest miner there to continue to mine well after place like the u have turned off their miner how would this realistically play out

1,a question around the future of self custody hey y'all long time lurker around these and other crypto related part of reddit i figured this would be the best community to ask an honest question i have regarding self custody and it idealized future with the recent collapse of ftx the greater crypto community ha been beating the drum of returning to the fundamental and the importance of not your key not your crypto i s listening to an interview on the breakdown with jesse powell of kraken this evening and he seemed to imply that the idea of keeping cash in a shoebox under your bed s some sort of perfect model for how people kept money in the past he s drawing the comparison to keeping cash under your bed in a shoebox in the old day and it felt like he s romanticizing it the implication is that keeping your crypto in cold storage on a hardre llet is what everyone should be doing i do this i've e this since i understood the importance of it when i first got into crypto in early i know i'm a baby i sn't affected at all by the collapse of ftx even though i'd purchased from them in the past self custody make sense to me it's certainly one of the value i identify with and understand a important to the space simply put we 't nt some centralized organization able to freeze our asset control how we spend our money or in anyy affect our decision surrounding it with all that being said here's my question if the idealized future of self custody is realized how doe that look for the normal person and will it ever include the same convenience assurance that large centralized bank offer the idea of keeping cash under my bed is frankly ridiculous there's so many thing that can go wrong my house could be broken into and my shoebox taken i could lose the shoebox the shoebox could be taken by a family member if i ever nt to spend that money i have to go home and physically get the cash to spend it somewhere the list go on virtually all the same problem exist today with cryptocurrency but to some degree they're even worse nt to spend some of my crypto i'd better have my physical hardre llet on me or i'd at least better have transferred some of it to a location that i can access it from the internet what happens if my house burn down maybe i stored my seed phrase in another location but that's kind of a lot to ask isn't it what happens if my hardre llet malfunction what happens if the company that owns the hardre llet push a bad firmre softre update sure i can alys restore that llet with my seed phrase but holy shit what a painful process not to mention the learning curve on all of it is certainly non trivial i'm a softre engineer a lot of the interaction intuitively make some sense to me i won't get too much into how the expectation of asking some non technical year old person is fairly ridiculous i imagine a lot of that will be ironed out over the year a we find a more seamless y to set llets up and interact with them i nt my question to focus around is there a world where self custody is ever a convenient a trusting some centralized agency with a massive infrastructure and the motivation for people to spend money is convenience and to a certain degree security fraud protection insurance etc simply a trade off of having direct control over your money or doe crypto have some long term solution for that i'm just too close minded to imagine will i alys have to carry my hardre llet around with me just curious to hear from others thanks

1,can bitcoin fail or face a lot of difficulty if mining difficulty get too high and miner get priced out due to unprofitability or some other cause hi all apology for the long post but i'm just doing some thought experiment and this s one of them i 't have enough knowledge about the mining side of btc to go through with this but my question is pretty much the title and i'd like to see what others think and hopefully some reasoning on why this isn't an issue below are some assumption behind the reasoning of this thought i understand the chance are incredibly low for all of these thing happening but i'm still curious to know and i think it would be a good discussion i'm also are of the difficulty adjustment per point but bear with me so i'm assuming btc price stay low suppressed miner get priced out due to unprofitability a lot and i mean a lot of miner stop mining within a short time horizon to prevent further loss i e multiple large mining pool stop mining so much so that there are far too many block until the next difficulty adjustment now there are a fraction of the miner left on the network tasked with solving block but the hash rate ha been reduced heavily resulting in a disproportioned difficulty level to hash rate block are then solved incredibly slowly and require a heavy amount of energy input and cost to solve still resulting in a potential loss even if we assume miner would receive a higher subsidy said another y i'm assuming that although le miner would be entitled to more of the block rerds aka would make it more profitable for them this increase in rerds is offset by the large increase in cost to solve the block removing any additional profitability and keeping them in a loss positionthis then lead me to a few question what the title is asking is the mining difficulty adjustment calculation weighted more tords the near term and would it help solve this issue after slowly solving the remaining block well above the desired average minute blocktime i'd appreciate any good resource on learning about the difficulty adjustment can something like this be mitigated is it crucially important for the average block to be solved every minute what happens if became one block per hour or worse than that i would think this is important a it help preserve the security of the network and to keep the cost to attack the network high via double spending or making a longer manipulated chainthat's the extent of my thought and question i'm no expert probably clear to some of you haha but nted to ask anyy thanks

1,isn't it plausible for bitcoin's market cap to exceed all value of fiat combined i've seen people say that bitcoin can never be priced at ridiculously high value such a mill per coin because that would make the market cap of bitcoin exceed the value of all money in the world however with more and more coin being lost then the higher the market cap can be if all million coin were mined and all but one coin is lost then that would leave that last coin left in circulation extremely valuable if that last coin is then valued at mill because that's all that's left then it would put the market cap at quadrillion dollar so we're put in a situation where the market cap of bitcoin surpasses all fiat money combined but only because the market cap is calculated on the million supply even if coin are lost forever

1,with time most online merchant are realizing the benefit of accepting bitcoin in their online store and dumping other altcoins a online merchant experiment with crypto and start accepting crypto payment they are often intrigued by the idea of accepting multiple cryptocurrencies but a time go by most of them often realize that there is really no real benefit of doing so and the best crypto to accept is bitcoin it is the only crypto that ha the most user base and the only one that is still standing today and will in the future even many crypto payment gateys for some reason also think it's lucrative to offer crypto option for their user but it's actually disadvantageous for online merchant who start accepting shitcoins on their webstores only to see their value drop or go to zero suddenly in the long run the safest bet is bitcoin whenever people ask me what's the best route to start accepting crypto my advice is alys to start with bitcoin and take it from there and use gateys that are noncustodial and 't ask for kyc if privacy is a concern there are many payment gateys that make it simple for online merchant to start accepting bitcoin on their online store and 't ask for id doc such a blockonomics gourl and btcpay server starting simple is alys the best y and experimenting with too many altcoins especially without prior knowledge is risky

1,our leader should encourage saving not consuming this is from the book market wizard jim rogers one of the best investor of all time is interviewed the basic problem in the world today is that america is consuming more than it is saving you need to do everything you can to encourage saving and investment eliminate tation of saving the capital gain tax and dual tation of dividend bring back the more attractive incentive for ira keoghs and k at the same time you need to do everything you can to discourage consumption change our tax structure to utilize a value added tax which tax consumption rather than saving and investing cut government spending dramatically and there are lot of y of doing it without hurting the economy too badly we would have problem but the problem would not be nearly a bad a when they are forced on u if we 't bite the bullet then we are going to have a s type collapse with the present cast of jerk in shinon it is not going to happen the politician are going to foul thing up they are not going to do what ha to be e they are going to be more concerned about keeping their vote and winning the next election that is going to continue until we are forced into solving our problem then it is going to be a disaster initially the politician will say we've got to bite the bullet and suffer through this this is good for u it will help clean out our system people are going to buy that for a while then it is going to start to hurt then it is really going to start to hurt at that point the politician are going to give up and they are going to start to inflate their y out of it but the only y to inflate your y out at that point is to really print money the dollar could eventually become like the argentine peso remember the civil r expression i 't give a damn about a greenback dollar
1,where is your crypto with the aftermath of ftx still rolling where are your fund now are you looking out for defi project or just sticking to cold llets
1,i'm from the future here's what ftx actually wa and what happened you may not see it now but sbf actually showed everyone what ftx s setup to do those involved felt ok doing it right out in the open because it's hard to imagine anyone would suspect what i am about to tell you if ftx s still operating to this day ftx s setup from the beginning a a dark money political slush fund this scheme alys had an exit strategy but it s supposed to be year if not decade down the road before they would need to exit they knew there s alys a chance someone would start to figure out what s going on but no one suspected this they were going to use ftx to fund everything they could to permanently take control of the u government over the next year think of the midterm a a trial run of this setup at sbf funneled million into the midterm making him the second largest democrat ator behind george soros it's very likely that m s ftxs customer fund or laundered money but it s safe to say at the very least it s not sbfs money the reason it seems like everyone is caught with pant down hoping if they hold still no one will notice is because they honestly t know what to do they are exposed so badly that for now the safest thing to do is nothing sam knew from the beginning it s all fake and no matter how much success or fame he gained from ftx that his fate would ultimately end with the event we saw the other day i can only speculate on this part but i think a time went on he really believed that if it weren t for those who orchestrated everything that he would be a successful ceo of an exchange like ftx over time he started to believe his action were why ftx s at the top of the world and he resented the fact he would never get credit for it resentment grew and he accelerated the process by taking action he sn t supposed to which led to the end of ftx to be clear i am saying the democrat and other powerful political entity set up ftx with the intention of using it to fund whatever they needed to expand their reach and stay in power they were going to continue operating a long a possible and they had a plan b that they saw a a win win the exit strategy all along s to blow up ftx in such a fashion that the sec would have what it needed to force regulation of the crypto space it would also help cover their track of their political operation the large medium company were also involved in running cover for this operation i m not sure how much they knew about what s really going on but i suspect they didn t know much they have operated essentially a a wing of the democrat party for year now and are likely comfortable doing this sort of thing without knowing why this is likely why they weren t worried about overselling smb and ftx to an absurd degree they likely wouldn t have been so obvious about it if they known what they were involved in covering up please note that some of the packaging includes part small enough to be a choking hazard to anybody under the age of the first step in the assembly process is setting the cartridge labelled 'izyalikeit' to at least a value of centi mark

1,loop need to be a standard on the lightning network for a hyperbitcoinized future to be viable everyone need to be able to use lightning for the vast majority of their transaction and the chain for massive purchase if on chain is a vault and lightning is the llet you lk around with easy transition between the two mode without sacrificing the interconnected nature of the ln is critical the loop feature that lightning lab ha developed need to be standardized and widely available to all or at least a variant of it i suspect that this vision of the future would have the bulk of on chain activity being loop processing one idea that i've been kicking around that i would like some feedback on is for lightning node to be able to both cooperatively close and open a lightning channel in a single transaction the two party would essentially be refreshing the channel but more importantly one or both of them could have additional input to increase the size of the channel or additional output for moving off the channel this same functionality could allow a service provider that manages multiple node with well connected channel to have an arbitrary number of single signer input sign fund into the refreshed channel and then routed back to them a loop in and multiple output that come from lightning payment to be sent back out a loop out the overall size of the channel then would have a net change of the amount looped in v out this should be possible to code without changing anything on chain merely an addition or change to the bolt specification to allow for this kind of refresh thought

1,please address my perceived weakness of bitcoin first of all i believe in the future of bitcoin and dca weekly a an investment however there seems to be huge weakness that i'd like to learn more about from this community to satisfy my naivete storage it's complicated 't hold your coin in an exchange not your key not your coin etc if the goal is world adoption then i feel like the barrier of entry is pretty high for people to safely store coin they have to buy on a trusted exchange then transfer them to a hardre llet where they are difficult to spend when the user is ready to many this process is confusing and expensive is there something i'm missing here loss of coin there will only ever be million coin however any user that is safely storing off an exchange risk total loss if they forget lose their key that is a huge risk sure le coin in circulation may increase the value of those that remain but on a long enough timescale all could be potentially lost i suppose hiding cash in your mattress until your house burn down is a comparable emple but that seems far le likely than losing your key

0,what are the main problem pe game need to solve to become mainstream although i have high hope for blockchain gaming there are certain evident problem that might limit widespread adoption and give the pe nft gaming industry more negative publicity i would add to the list some of these issue most people say that nft game are not fun i s one of them until i started checking out coinfantasy or god unchained it's true that there have been a ton of game token and release in the nft space recently and many of them look like garbage with very questionable gameplay it becomes tough to keep gamers engaged when the gameplay is extremely repetitive and there are le than minute of it people just stop playing the game when they stop making money overall the majority of current pe game feel more like a job with the worst kind of grind would you agree how about a high entry barrier the majority of casual player simply cannot pay the admission cost it cause two related problem first the game is inaccessible to regular user which hinders long term user growth second investor are typically trader rather than gamers the developer receive little input when the investor 't actually play the game and the game gradually dy poor tokenomics is probably one of the common issue trader buy nfts and hire gamers scholar to play the game using these nfts scholar make money in the form of native crypto token investor and gamers dump the token on new investor however once new investor stop to join the game there is no exit liquidity for current investor we all know that traditional gamers hate nfts but i believe that one of the problem is that investor have unrealistic expectation despite the fact that there are many problem with this sort of gaming in general i believe that we should give it a try because there are many fantastic game what do you think about all of the problem i've mentioned will they soon be resolved that in my opinion is the crucial element that will allow game to advance even further
0,how to track for certain all address affected by a transaction and from this i understand that a transaction between eoa_a and a smart contract can trigger transfer of token from the eoa_a that sent the transaction to another eoa_b but this transfer of token between eoa_a to eoa_b is not recorded on the blockchain my question now is if one is interested in tracking and be alerted by all activity on an account how will one do this for emple if i nt to be notified when token are transfered to eoa_b given the fact that the token transfer from eoa_a to eoa_b doe not show up in any transaction how can i be notified based on my knowledge one y could be to listen to transfer event on smart contract but follow up question a far a i understand it is possible for a smart contract to implement the transfer method without emitting the transfer event not good practice but nothing stopping this from happening which make me think this approach of listening to the transfer event might not be fool proof the transfer method and transfer event are standardized part of erc token but i can imagine that there are other method and operation peculiar to certain smart contract not standardized but that will also lead to token transfer from one eoa to another so that mean an approach of listening to just the transfer event will miss these kind of token movement so again the question how can one track all events' especially token and eth transfer in and out of an eoa given the technical drawback i listed below are there some knowledge about the working of ethereum that i do not know about that could make this possible

0,crypto tax are eth gas fee taxable here we get query on this subject all the time so i thought i'd clear the air when you dispose of cryptocurrency to pay for a fee you may trigger a capital gain tax c event on the disposal value of the fee itself depending on your tax jurisdiction of course a a result this capital gain loss is realised on the difference between the acquisition and disposal price of the cryptocurrency before paying for the fee a an emple you purchase eth to use for fee at the price of some time later you decide to mint an nft the gas fee for this mint are paid for in eth and you pay a gas fee of eth at the time of the sale the price of eth is now a a result you've actually made a gain on the eth itself which s used a a gas fee the reason why is because the acquisition value of the eth s and the disposal value of the eth is therefore this will trigger a capital gain event of for the sale of the eth which s used for gas while this may seem obvious to some you'd be surprised how many people forget to account for this in their capital gain calculation hope that clarifies thing and feel free to read more on this here

0,the truth about cbdcs design choice by ecb amp fed analysed both are aiming at tight control over account interest and spending a digital prison is being built in the shadow due diligence the truth about cbdcs ominous design revealed a digital prison is being built in the shadow massive overreach of central bank undery they are designing a new kind of money allowing them to establish centralized settlement of all payment tie digital identity to all transaction and record them on a central bank ledger forever force built in feature such a limit on how much cbdc you can have in your account negative interest rate account charge in line with regulatory objective and cap on conversion and spending create money that is traceable programmable table and subject to the monetary whim of central planner st out spending without permission and slowly phase out cash the r on money continues the aim to replace cash with a system of centralized control over all transaction and account balance this report explains ectly what to expect from central bank digital currency cbdcs it look at the possible design option what central bank have decided so far and the likely outcome the ugly conclusion is that cbdcs are a new form of currency that allows a small group of unelected people control over what we can and cannot do with our own money lt what is going on _a lot ha been said and written about cbdcs most s speculation but now evidence emerges of what is being built given that our financial system is complex one cannot just click a button and introduce a cbdc a of now much work ha already been e and much is still to be e this report trace the historical path of the development of cbdcs we start with looking at what cbdcs are then we look at why we need them a explained by the bank of international settlement bi next we look at how cbdcs are designed a the central regulator of central bank the bi made an inventory of all the different design option for cbdcs it also provided an honest account of the potential benefit and downside of those choice with this knowledge we can analyze the design choice made so far we observe how the european central bank ecb is going full steam ahead with their cbdc we come to the shocking discovery that the most important design choice have already been made and that there have even been company hired to start programming next we analyze what is happening in the u the u federal reserve fed is not a far advanced with their cbdc a the ecb however their frank report reveals that their cbdc design choice result in similar control mechanism a that of the ecb and it even expose possible sinister motif to put it bluntly what central bank are choosing for design so far tell u all we need to know about where this is heading authority are downplaying what is going on and pretending that all is open for debate and subjected to the democratic process but the design they are secretly pushing forrd open the door to the dystopian future we all fear lt what are central bank digital currency _before we can continue we have to define cbdcs after all we already have digital money but cbdcs and what we currently use a digital money are very different thing what we currently refer to a digital money is not issued by the central bank in the modern financial system the central bank only creates money in the form of cash bill and coin and cash deposit with bank all other money is created by private bank that s right the digital money currently in use is created by private institution the digital unit in your bank account are issued by a private bank cbdcs on the contrary are digital public money issued by the central bank cbdcs are a totally new kind of money with many new feature to summarize we go from two type to three type of retail money cash public money current digital money private money current cbdc public money new source ecb digital euro our future money note that cbdcs are essentially just different form of the same currency one unit of cash is on par with one unit of cbdc they are interchangeable for reason explained later these form of money are also intended to exist alongside each other for the foreseeable future to summarize central bank are issuing a new version of money which is a liability of the central bank a such cbdcs are not just another form of digital money a public money they are more comparable to the other form of public money cash this begs the question why do we need an addition replacement for cash lt why do we need cbdcs according to central bank _there is much debate on why cbdcs are being rolled out to avoid speculation we will stick with what the bi ha said about why we need cbdcs this approach help u to understand the decision central bank have taken and what the logical outcome will be financial stability and the reduced role of public moneyover the past few year cash ha become le popular this present a problem because a shown cash is currently the only form of public money used by the public retail and so when cash is phased out so is public money a principal concern of central bank is that if in the future cash were no longer widely accepted or available a severe financial crisis in the private financial system might create further havoc by disrupting day to day business and retail transaction cbdcs would be a y to keep the economy functioning monetary policyanother benefit of cbdcs touted by the bi is that they allow for a more direct influence on monetary policy argument for issuing a cbdc include potential strenhening of the pas through of the policy rate to money market and deposit rate and helping to alleviate the zero or effective lower bound constraint the bi also argues for direct stimulus let s take a look at each benefit strenhening of the pas through of the policy rate mean more control over the interest rate charged throughout the financial system central bank wish to bypass private bank and set rate directly from the moment that household consider a cbdc to be an alternative to commercial bank deposit bank will have le scope for independently setting the interest rate on deposit of the general public the zero lower bound describes the limit of negative interest rate in short in an environment of increasingly lower interest rate on bank account people might pull their money out of the bank it is after all better to hold cash than money in an account that charge deep negative interest rate to address this issue the imf circulated a paper called breaking through the zero lower bound it explores the idea of having different interest rate for different form of money for emple an additional interest rate on cash can very easily be charged on private bank through what is known a the cash window at the central bank the central bank charge the regular bank for the use of cash and the bank then charge the user through extra fee on withdrals and deposit this y the use of cash can be made more expensive than digital form of money this mechanism can be applied to steer the use of different form of money and even be a stepping stone on the road to a cashless society a you ll see later the imf s idea of different interest rate for different kind of money is vigorously embraced by central bank for emple the nigerian central bank used this idea to restrict cash shortly after introducing their unpopular cbdc and finally according to the bi cbdcs could facilitate a more direct distribution of fiscal stimulus to those member of the general public who need it this could make such policy more effective than general helicopter money or distribution through the indirect and imperfect banking channel which have been used in the past financial inclusionanother buzzword central bank like to use is financial inclusion with a cbdc everyone could have access to basic financial service this would be especially interesting for people not served by the current financial system which is a situation more prevalent outside the developed world but a alys like much else in the diversity and inclusion agenda these rosy goal are mostly a facade one of the most prominent organisation behind financial inclusion is the united nation for whom the financial inclusion agenda allows the unlocking of public and private resource to fund their sustainable development goal the un in turn coordinate it policy through the better than cash alliance an ngo acting a a front for the interest of among others the bill melinda gate foundation citi bank mastercard and visa inc in this light inclusive finance can be seen a the conversion of the unbanked into tax and debt serf who pay transaction fee and serve a collateral for the financial system financial innovationthe bi is discussing all sort of other feature all made possible by the idea of programmable money a we will see most of this innovation is in the interest of central bank one of the promised benefit of cbdcs is that it can make international payment much more efficient and transparent because these kind of liability are being built from scratch cbdcs are billed a offering a unique opportunity to facilitate easier cross border payment lt cbdc design choices_before we continue it is important to note that there have been few official decision made a to how to move forrd the introduction of a cbdc requires significant work and central bank are moving slowly in order not to break anything in this next section we look at the overview the bi ha made on designing cbdcs lot of research ha been e across academia financial institution and the central bank and the bi ha created a nice summary of the design option it also reveals what the benefit and downside of these design choice are with this knowledge we can then look at the design decision that have already been made by the ecb and fed and hence conclude what is happening behind the scene token v identity basedfirst of all a choice ha to be made a to whether the cbdc is to be token based or tied to an identity through an account according to the bi it ha to be either one or the other source bi quarterly review march a token based system would work like other crypto currency those with the private key can spend the money but the drawback according to the bi are severe one is the high risk of losing fund if end user fail to keep their private key secret furthermore it would be challenging to design an effective regulatory framework for such a system law enforcement agency would run into difficulty when seeking to identify claim owner or follow money flow just a with cash or bearer security in addition a token system would nullify the central bank objective discussed above the other option is that the use and ownership of a cbdc is accessible through an account tied to an identity similar to how the current banking system operates to make this happen the bi call for strong identity for all account holder where each individual is tied to one identifier across the entire payment system the disadvantage of an account based system according to a paper of the bi are that you cannot have anonymity vi a vi the central bank and there cannot be private peer to peer transaction without an intermediary a is currently possible with cash see graph source bi committee on payment and market infrastructure cbdcs direct or indirect liability the next question should people have an account directly with the central bank or through intermediary financial institution here the consideration are not just about what is desirable but also what is practically feasible currently central bank simply do not have the infrastructure to hold account for hundred of million of citizen in addition there are regulatory obligation such a kyc and customer due diligence that central bank do not have the infrastructure and mandate for the most logical outcome would be for central bank to use the existing financial company to roll out cbdcs on a more technical level the question then becomes is the cbdc to be a liability on the balance sheet of the central bank or on the balance sheet of a financial intermediary with the latter option the cbdc would be an indirect liability of the central bank also known a a synthetic cbdc the bi doe not like this idea centralized v decentralizedanother choice need to be made between using a decentralized settlement system or a centralized one firstly for regulator decentralized doe not mean the same thing a it doe to the industry they see it a a few regulated entity validating the settlement system moreover regular consensus mechanism have too much overhead and are too slow for the large number of transaction needed an issue the bi ha with a decentralized cbdc is that it mean that a decentralized network make adjustment to the balance sheet of the central bank this increase the risk to the system according to the bi programmabilityone of the main question a central bank ha to ask itself is whether it is going to create programmable money what is programmable money the u federal reserve provides a good definition a digital form of money and a mechanism for specifying the automated behavior of that money through a computer program this mechanism is termed programmability in this note across the pond in individual country within the eu the need for programmable money is being debated however a you will see in the following section programmability is an essential part of cbdcs the ecb ha even already released an api for institution to start programming financial stability requirementsthe fact that cbdcs are going to be exchangeable for digital currency result in some major risk to the financial system after all cbdcs make it easy to pull your money out of a private institution risk and deposit it with the central bank no risk if cbdcs could be freely traded the moment rumor spread that a bank is having issue all account holder will convert their account balance to cbdcs guaranteed by the central bank you could have instant bank run and collapse in the financial system would happen a quickly a they do in the crypto space in addition adding cbdcs increase the total amount of money in circulation creates even more inflation at a time when people are already having problem paying their bill a a result any cbdc need a built in mechanism to limit the amount of total cbdc that can be issued and limit how much can be exchanged for digital currency in short a programmable aspect of the cbdc ha to come into play we will see later how both the ecb and fed are already committed to using financial stability a an excuse to take full control over how cbdcs can be held charged and exchanged monetary policyone of the main activity of central bank over the last decade ha been trying to manage the economy through monetary policy up until now these intervention have not alys been effective in kick starting the economy cbdcs can give the central bank when properly designed much more direct tool for implementing monetary policy privacyprivacy is one of the main concern of regulator or at least it is the main concern for their potential user so this issue ha to be addressed in the design of the coin it is worth noting that privacy mean something different for central banker and for end user in the crypto space it mean that the technology make it impossible for anyone to track your purchase from the point of view of central bank privacy mean that the organisation monitoring and facilitating your payment are under constraint a to what they can and have to do with your data moreover central bank compare the privacy of cbdcs with data mining private financial service company and with transaction being e on public blockchains they argue that in that light public institution are better at safeguarding privacy for the design of a cbdc a central bank ha to make a decision a to what level of privacy a coin will have taking into account that full privacy is considered incompatible with other policy objective such a kyc and aml compliance a we will see there are strong indication that privacy a it is understood by the crypto industry is not going to be built into the cbdc system interoperabilitycentral bank will have to make certain design choice such a whether foreigner are to be able to hold account with the central bank or if there is to be some sort of exchange facility perhaps similar to what the crypto industry call an atomic sp a coordinated cbdc design effort could take a clean slate perspective and incorporate cross border payment option right from the start private v public chainon a final note investor in existing blockchains such a xlm or xrp have been publicly claiming that cbdcs will be built with their chain a the base layer this is simply not going to happen a previously mentioned cbdcs are liability on the balance sheet of the central bank there is no y that they are going to base this on an existing blockchain because it would mean they would have to take full control over the network now that we understand the different design choice available we can look behind the scene at how central bank are applying them starting with the ecb lt the digital euro ecb design choices_to understand the process of the creation of the digital euro we have to recap how the eu work this is well described by todd huizinga a former american diplomat to the eu he explains in detail that the eu is run by elite who wish to create an ever closer union regardless of the desire of the population of individual eu country a a result the eu ha created a culture where policy are presented a still being debated and subject to democratic principle whilst in fact behind closed door the direction is being agreed upon in backroom deal the same seems to apply to the eu s cbdc the digital euro the design and building of the digital euro is at an advanced stage while officially nothing ha been decided the reality however is that the issuing of the euro and logically also the design of the digital euro is delegated to the european central banking system and a you will see in the remainder of this section the digital euro train left the station a long time ago with funding already secured and company being hired to build the required infrastructure a it stand now legislation is to be finalized in q and only in q will the decision on the digital euro be formally approved note that by then the design will be finished the design choice of the digital euroin the ecb published their report on the digital euro it see the future euro a a safe digital asset with advanced functionality and with profound implication for key area of central banking for the broader economic and financial system and ultimately for the life of european citizen the digital euro would be first of all another y to supply euro convertible at par with other form of the euro a digital euro will be a liability of the eurosystem and therefore by definition risk free central bank money programmabilitythe digital euro should keep pace with state of the art technology at all time in order to best address the need of the market among required attribute are usability convenience speed cost efficiency and programmability it should be made available through front end solution throughout the entire euro area and should be inter operable with private payment solution programmability is going to be required for a number of desired feature there are going to be control on how much money can be exchanged between different form of the euro different interest rate on different form of the euro and limit on what one can hold and or transact in crisis situation there will likely be a maximum amount of cbdc which can be held by one person at no additional cost in term of monetary policy the digital euro should be remunerated at interest rate s that the central bank can modify over time and with different interest rate applied in different case to get an idea of how much digital euro each account owner is allowed to own before being faced with restrictive measure such a negative interest rate the dutch central bank suggests that euro should be enough for most dutch citizen a it represents one month s living expense and a financial buffer for unforeseen expense next to the account feature there is work being e on special payment instruction such a payment e between machine in short the digital euro is going to be programmable and not in a y that improves financial freedom account based access and the digital identitythe bi report taught u that central bank can issue a token or an account based system the ecb indeed discus both a possible option a pure bearer token system a exemplified by regular crypto currency would take ay the control of the ecb thus according to the ecb such a system can only be allowed when both user are uniquely identified for emple with biometrics e g fingerprint and iris recognition the account based system on the other hand would be operated in the same y a the current banking system this is the preferred system of the ecb where they operate the back end while existing supervised intermediary operate the front end a we see shortly financial service provider have already been hired to build this system a we speak the infrastructure for the digital euro is being built along with an eu wide digital id this digital id governed by the eidas regulation aim to help business citizen and public authority carry out electronic interaction this digital id will contain your relevant data such a name address biometrics driver s licence medical data and will be used to facilitate transaction open bank account online shopping financial service such a insurance and god know what else this digital id s approved in early december but like the cbdc s already being built and funded long before that central or decentralized controlthe ecb s report repeat the bi s option of having a decentralized settlement system however the ecb is not going for this model they state that the central bank will control the back end and ha control over all the unit that are to be created other possible featuresother design option are discussed such a the possibility for hardre wearable virtual card with additional feature such a shorter expiration date and spending limit and a pan european merchant solution privacy only for low value transaction the above statement is from a more recent letter by fabio panetta the driving force behind the digital euro according to him the ecb will explore if they can allow some anonymity in the system the ecb is addressing privacy in response to a public consultation where the ecb asked european citizen what they thought of a european cbdc it received an avalanche of negative response and privacy s the most cited worry but the statement of the ecb on privacy are contradictory in public official tout it a an important feature but if you then look at their most recent internal presentation on privacy they explain that user anonymity is not a desirable feature a this would make it impossible to control the amount in circulation and to prevent money laundering the truth is that a gradual shift to digital payment implies le privacy by default the ecb suggests that the digital euro should be designed so that the eurosystem should only be able to see the minimum transaction data however they are settling the transaction and will need to know who is paying what to whom it is quite clear that privacy is not built into the system the ecb suggests that some privacy can be allowed for certain low value payment and offline functionality however higher value transaction would remain subject to standard control lt programming the european cbdc ecb softre package_on the th of december the ecb published a package for financial intermediary to start building application for the digital euro the publication contained cover letter confirming the design choice discussed above but also a softre package with the application programming interface api a set of defined rule that explain how the computer of bank are to communicate with those of the central bank source ecb website digital euro api package this package provides a programming standard for bank and payment provider that serve the general public it allow them to process payment digitally while the eurosystem settle the payment the ecb is testing a system where intermediary get to program different kind of transaction five company have been selected to build softre integration on a settlement layer hosted by the ecb each will test a different type of transaction a an annex to the article one can download the code of the actual api from the source code a number of additional conclusion can be drawn about the model currently being pursued the digital euro will have intermediary deal with client and the ecb ultimately settling all the transaction the intermediary creates the payment the eurosystem approves and then a callback confirms the detail of the transaction with detail on the time and date it settled despite the non stop bashing of bitcoin by the ecb the current proposal us the same technology utxo pub private signature and even the same security model secpk a bitcoin the ecb is literally creating a bitcoin rip off and may even be re using open source bitcoin code the ecb will respond to every payment request with either settled or failed meaning that it ha the ultimate control over what payment do and do not get approval it is unclear what condition would result in a failed payment given the large number of transaction the ecb will have to process and the risk of running complex softre at a settlement layer it is hard to imagine the ecb programming payment condition for specific case however running a payment through a sanction list or a list with basic condition might be feasible moreover it seems likely that programming feature will be enforced at the layer above the settlement layer for emple the ecb is working on a dedicated programmability platform layer between the settlement layer and the intermediary layer source ecb programmable payment in digital euro the documentation explains how intermediary create llet address on behalf of their client it is only this address the ecb see the more sensitive account detail are kept with the financial service provider this is explained a safeguarding privacy however a permanent record of all transaction is stored all the ecb need to do is match a name to each address and it see everything it is a of yet unclear how monetary and financial stability objective are going to be coded into this system it also is not clear how the ecb aim to reconcile the contradiction of limit on account balance and their privacy goal the latest ecb progress update doe not alleviate these worry it state that for online payment the eurosystem itself will record transaction and perform associated verification task and it happens to be that online payment are the category of payment with the broadest set of high level use case now ask yourself how large a share of payment in a digital currency will be e online in any case it is safe to assume there is not going to be real privacy in this system because with this design either the central bank or the intermediary know the identity of the user behind each transaction u federal reserve design of the digital dollar_compared to the ecb the american central bank the federal reserve is not a far advanced with designing their cbdc however in january the fed did release their report money and payment the u s dollar in the age of digital transformation in the opening paragraph the fed repeat the familiar take that cbdcs are a different kind of money compared to existing form and state that in their opinion a cbdc is a digital liability of the federal reserve that is widely available to the general public it would be the safest digital asset available to the general public with no associated credit or liquidity risk the report point to the fact that the federal reserve act doe not allow direct federal reserve account for individual the fed will therefore have to adopt an intermediary model where the private sector would offer account or digital llets to facilitate the management of cbdc holding and payment just a with the ecb you will not have an account directly with the fed but although commercial bank and non bank would offer these service to individual the cbdc itself would be a liability of the federal reserve further on the fed argues that a future cbdc should be intermediated widely transferable and identity verified while at the same time being privacy protected these are again contradicting objective a a use case the fed note that government could use a cbdc to collect tax or make benefit payment directly to citizen additionally a cbdc could potentially be programmed to for emple deliver payment at certain time again programmable money additionally a cbdc could potentially be used to carry out micro payment and streamline cross border payment by using new technology crucially the fed recap the risk unlimited use of cbdcs pose to the stability of the financial system a such the fed also proposes the variation of interest rate on different kind of money and limit on the amount an end user could hold moreover to prevent a flight to safety it proposes limit to the amount a user could accumulate in a short period of time and last but not least the fed discus it monetary policy and the need to expand it balance sheet to accommodate cbdc growth part of this could be mitigated by shifting ay from existing non reserve liability yes the fed is suggesting withdrawing cash to make room for cbdcs new york fed testing of wholesale cbdcsthere were a number of recent headline reporting that the new york fed had started a week test of their first cdbc however this project is mostly about exploring the concept of a wholesale cbdc this is a form of cbdc that is only used to settle the liability of regulated financial institution although interesting it doe not tell u much about the future of retail cbdcs which are the main subject of this report fednow payment systemfednow is another project under development by the fed that is sometimes confused with a cbdc this facility will enable individual and business to send instant payment between account while the idea of instant settlement reminds u of crypto currency what is settled are not central bank liability a such fednow is not a cbdc system lt conclusion the cbdc prison being built_central bank around the world have started building cbdcs these need to be designed and each design ha consequence when looking at the design choice made so far we can see where thing are headed and it doesn t look good a of now no formal decision have been made in the jurisdiction discussed regardless the eu s direction seems clear perhaps the u congress still ha a say in the future of money we shall see what we see in the work is a system where small group of unelected people get to approve all payment there will be no privacy it ha purposefully designed feature that control how much money you can hold and what kind of charge and negative interest rate apply a system of constant surveillance and the centralization of sensitive information and then we haven t even talked about all the other policy increasingly being enforced through the financial system such a a personal co budget or other social credit system the re directing of private resource tords public policy goal blended finance and the exclusion of political undesirable cbdcs replace cash with a kind of money you never legally own you can directly be charged interest and fee on and cannot spend without permission do you nt this source this post is larger than character so i removed the footnote from this post full list of footnote can be found here download this article in pdffor a pdf version of this article to store or share click tldr cbdcs are liability directly with the central bank they are a new kind of money next to cash and digital money currently held in private bank the bank of international settlement made an overview of all research into cbdcs it show that each design ha consequence the ecb ha chose for a design where intermediary deal with the client but the ecb settle all payment there is no real privacy in the system to ensure financial stability the ecb wish to maintain control over account balance apply variable interest charge and monetary policy stimulus the digital euro is in a far stage of development the federal reserve act force the fed to go through intermediary a well the digital usd will be programmable and identity verified to ensure financial stability the fed wish to maintain control on interest charge and maximum account balance the fed also argues that cbdcs might have to replace cash to maintain a healthy balance sheet the digital usd appears to not be in a far stage of development

0,ethereum contract that emits event log once every block hello guy i m new to the sub but ha been writing web off chain back end code for a over a year now i m looking for ethereum contract topic combination that is guaranteed to emit at least event log or very few but preferably just every block for testing my library code so do you guy know of any such contract thank you if you nt to know why i need event log it s because because the go library i m writing center around it being event log polling building block with real time chain reorganization detection and handling baked in to detect chain reorg while only getting information from event log i use log s block hash and will only fetch block header for block hash if there s a reorg and a log disappeared from the block so that s why i need event log for block hash and not the block header it is now e and will soon be open sourced so i m writing emples for devs one of the emples is a single file chain reorg monitor service so i need a contract and topic that would make the emple seems reasonable and cheapest to run hence the question i wouldn t nt to follow a topic with too many log just to detect a chain reorg

0,a piggy bank with stablecoins in ethereum using multi signature wallet hi i have this particular use case and would like to share it so people can recommend any solution besides building the solution myself so here it is i nt to keep some usdc or busd under a multi sign llet which requires signature to spend the fund of signature but i can see a couple of issue with only having party and needing signature to perform anything with any fund in that multi sign first death second separation of the party involved and a need to return fund to each party death if one of the two party dy during the duration of this trust of fund the remaining party need to go through and recover the other party's llet to do anything with the fund which is an annoyance at best separation let's say any of the involved party nt to stop putting money into this trust fund again is that the name of this thing and leave with their corresponding share of the money but the other party doesn't nt to sign anything which freeze the fund until the dispute is settled and worst case scenario none of the party doe what the other part asks and a judge get involved to resolve the conflict then some solution come to mind solving both particular edge case at the same time involving a third party that play the role of arbitrator it could be a lawyer who represents both party but these cost money and you need to trust the lawyer to do the right thing to me what come to mind is a smart contract is cheaper than a lawyer and you can write one if you know what you are doing to do the right thing but a smart contract can control of the fund and do whatever n of m signature request right i wonder if a smart contract can be a signer party in a multi sign llet my reasoning for that is that the n of m smart contract signer control of the fund if someone smarter than the person writing the contract nt to exploit a bug the attacker won't get anything of value because he still need other signer to participate in the hack of the signer in this case okay so the question is there something like this out there in ethereum that can be used for cheap and with a frontend that won't banish suddenly or do i need to build it myself

0,how eips are approved on ethereum a simple explanation an eip can be submitted by anyone and becomes the responsibility of the author once they re created the author informs other developer of their proposal gather support to build and launch it and document work throughout the process the majority of eips are standard track eips proposal that change the ethereum protocol itself broadly anything that technically change ethereum is a standard track eip there are several sub type under the standard track core network interface erc core eips core eips are change drastic enough to require a fork in the blockchain fork are when the blockchain split in two because of a major decision with one path following the old rule and the new path following the new one networking eips networking eips are improvement to node communication and transaction are transmitted on ethereum transaction are encrypted when sent when i send you fund i'm encrypting a message that only you can decrypt change to these aspect are networking eips interface eips interface eips are improvement for how application interact with ethereum they standardize the api used for communication with the blockchain an emple is eip which changed an opcode on ethereum from suicide to self destruct for mental health reason erc eipsfinally erc eips establish new standard on ethereum often for smart contract these standard are responsible for token on ethereum erc and non fungible token erc and many more without these standard token wouldn t be easily tradeable additional eip typesstandard track eips the one listed above are the most common the le frequent meta eip cover non technical change in process how development overall is managed finally instead of proposing new feature informational eips elaborate on existing design detail the eip approval process eip eips can be proposed by anyone but often require the work of multiple people depending on their impact eip editor review eips that are submitted and multiple developer are usually required to build a feature the effort to rerd ratio factor greatly into which proposal are prioritized and which aren t they all follow an identical process that determines which eips get delivered first before submitting an eip author should first vet the idea with others in the ethereum development community assuming the idea is not covered by an existing eip the author creates a draft and submits it to the eip editor there are different eip editor responsible for each sub type of eip they re responsible for making sure the proposal are technically sound once that s e they create the draft version of the eip once an eip editor feel like the draft is ready to receive feedback from the community they move it from being in draft to in review at this stage any member of the ethereum development community can share their thought on how the proposal can be improved once complete the eip enters the last call stage this provides a final opportunity for feedback to be shared usually within day if any major change come up the proposal move back to review if no major feedback arises then the eip move into the final stage once an eip is final it becomes a candidate to include in ethereum s periodic upgrade called fork the process highlight the importance of individual responsibility in a decentralized environment no feature would be delivered if not chioned by at least one person to start and each is only made complete through the process of peer review may the brightest idea win thank you for reading if you learned something interesting sign up to my free newsletter below i'll send you one email a week with a simple write up on a blockchain topic no ad shill or affiliation stay kind stay curious

0,visa is looking at way it can help the ethereum ecosystem develop have you heard about visa's most recent revelation that it is working to implement auto payment on ethereum through the development of a novel llet type a procedure dubbed account abstraction by the company according to what i've heard visa did in fact issue a technical paper in which it looked into the idea of creating an automatic payment mechanism for ethereum self custodial llets i find it amazing what we can all do with the help of modern technology cryptocurrencies and other thing in addition to the payment system the ticketing industry and other thing blockchain may also prevent the production of free clean energy i also think that the energy sector will use blockchain in the near future the amount of electricity needed to meet the world's energy need a well a the effect of the global community on the climate and the cost of energy might be greatly reduced thanks to this cutting edge technology claim elan future enabling auto payment for self custodial llets is difficult in light of the recent visa and eth news a doing so may require granting access to one's private key to a smart contract that will be making the payment on their behalf in essence auto payment have the potential to jeopardize the security offered by self custody the process of confirming a transaction on the blockchain would apparently become more flexible a a result of all of this in my opinion visa for emple belief it would permit multi owner account through multi sig and public account from which anybody may do business
0,ethereum is useless here's whyso a you know after the merge eth moved to proof of stake and you needed to stake a min of eth most people could not afford it so centralized exchange made staking pool and of staked eth is in those pool which of the exchange control those have to follow their goverment and llets even on defi can be blacklisted remeber the trucker movemnt with proof of work the govt could not control it but sadly with proof of stake they have given control to the govt therefore eth is now a centralized shit coinand the govt can control it and there is no real use of it and you can't really call it crypto btw here s why thank you this post can get removed for telling the truth btw my contact discord legend email i almost never check it one gmail com mailto one gmail com bye

0,will a transaction with no priority fee use up the gas limit from ledger's website you can send transaction without adding a priority fee however keep in mind that setting a very low priority fee is risky transaction may it in a pool until the entire gas limit is used up this confuses me i think i understand the concept of gas limit and i t see how it applies here my understanding s that until a transaction is picked it sits in the mempool and doesnt burn any gas if it's picked then only gas limit matter not max fee nor max priority fee in other word is there a risk to setting max fee that are too low apart from getting a stuck transaction

0,idea how we could create timelocked transaction backup to recover ether from lost key i have been thinking a lot lately about key management and fund recovery it occurred to me that we could create a system that allows u to recover fund from lost key by signing time bound transaction which can sweep our fund in the event that we lose access in a nutshell this work by signing a transaction that deploys a contract which sends fund to another address this could be a friend family member or even your exchange and setting time constraint such a not valid before and or not valid after you can also sign many of these transaction with multiple nonce value so that you still have a valid transaction in the event that you make future transaction since this signed transaction is constrained to the recipient and certain time criterion it is not sensitive and can be stored anywhere including on the cloud a a user you have the power to invalidate the transaction at anytime by either spending the fund or using up all the nonce i have started creating a prototype here let me know what you think of the concept and how you would improve it merry christmas

0,a simple explanation of eof evm object format eof is the biggest upgrade in the evm's history coming in the shanghai fork in march eof will completely change how ethereum work here's a summary eip the first upgrade in eof change how instruction to the evm are structured specifically it establishes a structure where one didn t really exist before it split bytecode into two string of character one containing code and the other containing data this eip also make it easier to upgrade the evm it creates a system to distinguish new contract and what feature each is using the evm executes each program based on the version of the evm it s released in so new upgrade can be delivered more easily eip this introduces the concept of code validation specifically when a smart contract is deployed contract today aren t validated by the ethereum network before they re deployed they get validated a they re executed by people validating contract upon deployment save significantly on execution cost program are validated once upon deployment and any necessary data for operation is made available in the data section of the bytecode eip quick tangent stack machine can be imagined a glass container tall and thin they execute instruction and store data in these glass container the first piece of data is placed at the bottom and everything afterrds get placed on top in a stack stack machine have pointer that can move between piece of data to read them the y ethereum shift it pointer today is with a jump which requires a destination or a jumpdest eip 's new opcodes enables the ethereum stack machine to shift it pointer far more efficiently this result in cheaper gas fee both for deploying a contract a well a for interacting with one it also make on chain analysis easier eip this introduces function that the stack itself can perform function are instruction that need to be performed more than once in a program writing such instruction once a a function make program more efficient leading to cost saving on ethereum currently function t exist at the bytecode level that the stack machine executes on ethereum to repeat instruction the jump and jumpdest opcodes are instead used to shift the pointer to where an instruction is when it need to be executed eip this eip focus on validating contract upon deployment but by looking for error the stack machine might encounter called stack overflow or underflows stack overflow when a stack is out of space stack underflow retrieving data from an empty stackdespite stack overflow and underflows being basic error they can occur on ethereum today the check to prevent them are introduced with this eip eof is a suite of eips together making evm execution more efficient more consistent and more easily upgradeable eof itself is first upgrade in the evm's history and can be expected in the shanghai hard fork in march if you'd like to learn more read the full write up on my free newsletter below

0,l protocol finally seem to be gaining traction l protocol finally seem to be gaining traction which is good news for ethereum at this point it would seem plausible to conclude that ethereum ha successfully used network effect and the first mover advantage in the field of smart contract technology and that it should now be trying to expand on this a stage that layer s can enable which one do you employ i'm used to metis a scaling solution that also seek to enhance the dao idea by making it into something more serious through what it refers to a a dac the ethereum network which ha the most developer activity and is the only cryptocurrency that is not obscure to those who are not active in crypto may continue to be at the center of web a it develops a a sign of ethereum's trustworthy reputation i'd say that eth is the only cryptocurrency except for bitcoin which can be seen a a somewhat conservative digital asset to own over the long run although ethereum is currently dominant and should remain so it would be wrong to claim that there is no potential for any rival layer s a direct competitor to ethereum that offer identical functionality without the gas cost and scaling issue is referred to a alternative layer
0,this post is simply about future value of eth i s a bitcoin maxi i moved a lot of to eth i still purchase a little bitcoin but more future cash flow go to bitcoin here's my question do you believe that more and more people that hold btc will start to move tords eth it appears that this is a much slower process than i anticipated and there's still a belief by many that eth is worthless which i can't understand but it's similar to many gold silver people thinking crypto is worthless i think asset have high volatility because human are alys fearful and greedy it will never end i saw this with housing when i s i saw people that made k a year admittedly a good chunk of money back then owning home all with massive leverage and nonsensical loan when i s i saw those same home lose of their value and yet there being cricket at fire sale open house if this is true for eth do you believe s the bottom or that we are not at the final flush out one of the most common narrative is that the institution are coming that if just of asset go into this sector price go banana i've heard this with gold with bitcoin etc i hear it for etc that in fact institution will buy it because proof of stake is a lot more palatable than the proof of work energy perception do you think this is actually reasonable or a sale pitch i understand the idea of holding for year or forever but i also understand life happens for those who own eth is there a price that you would sell your eth and if so how much of your position and why give me your most bullish and bearish price target and why by and or

0,short passage to be explained like am guy i usually get english but this time it all going over my head i know what finality mean i know both finalisation and justification upgrade but the following did not make sense to me finality requires a two third agreement that a block is canonical an attacker cannot possibly create an alternative finalized chain without owning or manipulating two third of the total staked ether destroying at least one third of the total staked ether the first condition arises because two third of the staked ether is required to finalize a chain the second condition arises because if two third of the total stake ha voted in favor of both fork then one third must have voted on both double voting is a slashing condition that would be maximally punished and one third of the total stake would be destroyed what i understood of total eth staked need to be vote for upgradation of the concerned block the above alone and not even the reasoning or how this voting happens like if they ask for finalising justifying x block or is all of that e by only asking which chain is the correct latest blockchain state or what ectly is asked can someone please simplify this for me i do not understand anything from the second condition paragraph please explain me that paragraph in simple manner

0,cbdcs good or bad for ethereum and crypto a a whole i 't know how much information there is about cbdcs in your country or what they plan to implement but here in brazil the central bank made it really clear through several lecture and qas what they're planning it sound like they're preparing a private ethereum fork to reap all the benefit of the blockchain and smart contract and enhance our financial system but of course with the central bank having admin power over the network sound kind of contradictory to have a blockchain with an admin yes but there are still some good point we'll have asset tokenization atomic sps aave style automatic loan liquidation and everything that defi doe in real decentralized network basically people will deposit their normal money to a bank and choose to mint the digital version of it and in there they'll have access to a gated ethereum like ecosystem the lead guy said the plan is to allow financial transaction that wouldn't be possible otherwise a they would require a middleman that increase cost thought

0,ml for detecting dodgy contract to me it seems like one of the most common problem in crypto is dodgy smart contract people sign stuff from llets that they shouldn't be signing because it lead to them losing a lot of money i thought it would be a good idea to train a ml model that take in various input i'll list some out below to get an idea and determines whether the contract is a scam or not or at least generates some safeness score i think it could also store this in a database that could be publicly available either through an api or maybe through a blockchain emples of factor would be website age github star presence transaction history history of people having problem website itself something like codex applied to the contract to understand what it doe and determine if it is a scami think there are many more input that can be considered and the goal is obviously to reduce fraud in the crypto space and make it a bit more trustworthy what do people think

0,smart contract utility explanation this is what someone said when i said smart contract were useful can anyone debunk it no they are not useful and some of them are so insane that i can't believe anybody who spent more than second thinking about them would ever think they're useful it even touch on the fatal flaw of smart contact while falsely claiming they're the solution if there s a dispute between the two party a governmental third party must get involved in many case this third party will also play a role in the creation of the contract ok so what if there actually is a dispute the contract say x is supposed to happen but enforcement is automatic based on certain condition but what about condition that aren't able to be included in the contract sure rent is due on the first but the ter s off for a week and the tenant doesn't owe the full amount all contract for stuff in the real world still have to abide by the legal system which mean ultimately court need to be able to control what happens even if someone absolutely refuse to play along imagine you're trying to sell a house using smart contract do you even own the house in the first place just because you have some token saying you do doesn't mean you actually do if someone steal your private key do they now own your house if the token is not the actual definitive record of ownership and it absolutely should not be then you haven't removed reliance on third party but just added an irrelevant not legally binding aspect to the system and of course all of this is assuming that we can make smart contract perfect without any error code can and will have error and many people have already lost fortune due to poorly written contract if there's no enforcement system external to the contract it's not usable in the real world if there is an external system then the smart contract is no longer the definitive truth and serf no useful purpose

0,here s how l are planning on moving from fast to even faster l have made major gain in the recent year and have developed new tech and upped their throughput ethereum a well ha pushing into upgrading the chain in a y that boost l throughput dank sharding tords the end of however regardless of how fast a chain l can process transaction there will alys be the issue of dependency what are dependency dependency are the result of blockchains and in extension l processing transaction in a sequential manner dependency is when every transaction relies on the one before it in order for it to get executed this mean that while a blockchain l might have great processing power all of that power is being focused on one transaction at a time regardless of how significant said transaction really is this put a massive restraint on the capability that a blockchain l is capable of performing think of it a you buying a new packaging machine for your factory this packaging machine ha slot to handle multiple package at the same time however your factory only ha one conveyor belt meaning so you can technically work package at a time but practically you re restrained by the sequential order you re forced to follow how are l trying to solve this issue one y of solving this issue is implementing a parallel evm engine aptos lab developed a block stm engine and to make it short and uncomplicated for the average reader what this doe is it executes a bunch of transaction in parallel it doe that under the assumption that none of the transaction conflict one l polygon adopted a similar approach to their evm in order to scale ethereum but it came with it own set of complication because polygon process a massive volume of transaction the system that aptos came up with won't work because in a hugely adopted system like the polygon po acting a if there were no dependency anywhere in any block won t work it would be taking a theoretical idea too farwhat polygon did instead s write transaction in a data structure called dag if you nt you can expand your knowledge on this but in order to save time and not make thing complicated what this doe is take dependency into consideration and then execute transaction before validating so that the metadata with deduced dependency can be easily executed what doe this mean for ethereum while there still aren t any parallel evm chain right now a we saw certain l like polygon are working on developing one and hopefully this push other l to follow suitthis is definitely an added value for ethereum in ethereum s new roadmap the chain will rely solely on l for scalability so this will be major news considering that a development like this one will most likely double the throughput that any l is currently putting out all of which will benefit ethereum since it main issue ha alys been scalability restraint

0,how ha the transition to po gone so far been researching and adding up my stake in xmr and bch but eth is catching my eye a bit more however the previous two coin are proof of work which i think i understand the pro and con of well enough proof of stake on the other hand ha me getting pretty mixed feedback and i'm not sure what to think a there appears to still be much uncertainty about the pro con of po v pow from what i gather some thought are pro more energy efficient not inherently a bad thing to use a lot of energy but a lot of energy s mined in china which us le clean source such a coal or natgas faster lower time complexity and all that more scalable a le computation power is required that mean it can run much more smoothly a eth is something of an investment rather than something backed by computation con more beneficial to centralization and the rich by the model though i will note this arguably applies to pow a any oligarch who nted to take over could pay someone with technical expertise to set up their own rig and pay them a commission or something like that allowing potentially for censorship and coopting whether by force or by a attack le secure validators could be bribed more threatened by censorship than pow coin i for one think government ha no role to play in the creation or regulation of money and that no man should have control over it in other word i support the separation of state and money for the good of the mass mixed neutral still ha high gas fee use case is defi rather than outright cash though in theory perhaps it could be used for that a well bch is trying to get into defi a well from my understanding so perhaps eth could do something in the other direction is this correct are the con overstated i know le about po and eth defi in general than i do pow or the coin mentioned above all feedback appreciated

0,idea for pp exchange that run faster and more smoothly than a cex hey everyone i had an idea for a pp exchange like bisq for uk and eu but us open banking ob to get around many of the shortcoming that bisq ha i nt to get feedback on this preamble recently you may or may not know that stripe released it own r in the u a ha moonpay etc i ve used the moonpay one a few time to buy small amount of eth for quick test when i t nt to use my main llet on a transaction i s charged and stripe also take a ridiculous cut obviously it possible to go through cexs but it not easy to integrate a low fee r onto a defi website and from a cex and people dislike cex s for a variety of good reason it s incredibly frustrating seeing large fee or complex process to get token into my llet from fiat bisq ha two major flaw in my opinion besides the fact it in the u im from the uk which i would say is more forrd facing on the fintech side there is little control over order size it not super liquid the payment method are dodgy on the fiat side most importantly require proof of transaction which is difficulti propose an exchange that combine bisq s framework with open banking and some inspiration from unisp that should allow virtually free pp trustless flexible ring a seller put their erc token in a liquidity pool smart contract and sign a hash with the block number which is communicated to the buyer a buyer enters the amount they wish to buy and the price is determined by an amm or get the spot price from unisp binance an algorithm figure out everyone they need to pay and generates a qr to pay everyone you can bank transfer multiple people at the same time in the uk for free and instantly using ob called pisp the hash is in the reference hashed with the buyer address an algorithm scan the seller data to look for the hash and once it is there us the hash to unlock the contract using some zk proof and can generate the address from the signed hash of the seller or scan the buyer bank data to ensure the transaction ha been made once the contract receives this proof it sends the buyer address the stored token this is the simple version i ve thought alot about the associated problem including being unable to verify account data etc to what extent doe this rely on a centralized entity etc the conclusion i ve reached is that this should feel completely seamless for the buyer thanks to open banking i e scanning qr code i believe in interoperability not competition between good cefi innovation and defi it is completely non custodial at all stage there is actually no cost in this entire process except that of transferring the token to sell to a contract i think the concept of liquidity provider earning some fee like a on unisp can fix potential liquidity problem grateful for any feedback

0,here s an extremely simplified no coder explanation of why not all l are built the same explaining this subject without getting too deep into coding language and technicality is extremely hard to tackle but i ll try my best of course this isn't some sort of guide on how l are built or operate but is merely a fun quick explanation of how some of them are different i ll be focusing on zkevm compatibility and will be comparing the top ethereum l on the market with zero knowledge tech starknet zksync polygon zkevm ethereum standard language solidity solidity solidity solidity transitional language readable cairo llvm ir ir ir bytecode opcode bytecode cairo assembly zinc instruction micro opcode opcode runtime cairo zkevm zinc zkevm zkevm evm a we can see although they all do a great job at scaling ethereum some have a slighter advantage polygon zkevm polygon is currently a type in evm equivalence meaning they built an infrastructure that is compatible with evm at bytecode level this mean polygon s zkevm can achieve compatibility at both the solidity language level and opcode level scroll also ha similar feature but i m not sure if it s bytecode equivalent correct me if i m wrong competitor on the other hand are at levelwhile competitor are at type in evm equivalence meaning theywhat it basically mean is that they take a high level coding language like vyper or solidity and transpile it down to snark friendly vm language level e g zksync's zinc and starkre's cairo for the average no coder these might seem like very slight difference that t make any difference but this couldn t be farther ay from the truth these small difference are being developed to end up achieving full ethereum equivalent type evms which is a feat still not achieved by any l

0,the fact that centralized platform hold this much power in a space centered around decentralization is a problem this isn t what vitalik or satoshi envisioned the entire reason cryptocurrencies were created to begin with because of centralized institution like bank and government taking control through financial mean these centralized exchange and other cefi platform aren t any different they have full control over our hard earned fund and can legally do whatever they nt with them this is not to mention that they re regulatory compliant meaning the government can basically tell them what to do how did it come this far ethereum and it dapps are a thing for a reason why use a centralized exchange when dexs are a thing especially when you take into consideration that they come with many more perk the defi is expensive argument had long been dead with the advent of l and other scaling solution the ogs like arbitrum and optimism are there for a reason and now you got ethereum based organization like bitdao investing hundred of million of dollar into scaling solution which resulted in l like mantle with hyperscalability feature for dapps and web tech i d hate to see all of this r d money being sted while we invest more into centralized exchange why t we take advantage of all of this tech and the fact that l have become y more powerful and start investing in defi instead i m sick and tired of seeing people lose money because of the recklessness of centralized exchange

0,staked eth what are your thought on having eth still staked on coinbase should i wrap it and sell it and then buy back into eth and move to my trezor the price difference to wrap and sell plus the fee would be about an automatic loss which i guess really isn't too big of a deal when looking at how far eth ha fallen this year in the bear market still ha held up reasonable well compared to the past should i just forget about the loss to do this and get off the exchange asap it's the only thing left on coinbase besides my little bit of algo which i'm about to move a well

0,is validator uptime actually a vulnerability signal hear me out before burning me at the stake here there are many assumption taken in this post o client fallback client etc and even more edge case that refute my thought this post is intended to shed light on a general case that may apply to many validators if not most given it would seem to affect vanilla validator configuration validator uptime is a publicly discernable attribute through missed attestation and a anybody running a validator should know critical node maintenance like security update oftentimes require a system restart that would result in publicly vieble downtime if i s a malicious actor that nted to attempt to gain access to validator key by compromising these node then this uptime metric could provide me a fast and easy short list of validators that likely have not gone through this maintenance effort i could even rank my list depending on how long the validator ha been online targeting node that potentially have not been restarted in month or year with the assumption that security exploit are more effective on these node missing a few attestation is relatively painless from a financial perspective if a node operator is hellbent on not performing maintenance on their system for whatever reason would it make sense to pay a few cent each month and create a script that would cut network activity to the node for a few hour at the end of every month if it were me i think i would pay this low cost to avoid being placed on the malicious actor short list then again if it were me i would just update my node instead
0,presale smart contract hello everyone i would like to share with you my project that i've developed for a customer the project purpose is to manage a variable number of pre sale seed sale round this project contains the smart contract written in solidity and ready to be deployed on evm blockchains ethereum bsc cronos here below the main feature manage a pre sale seed sale with only one smart contract is possible to manage multiple sale round for potentially multiple token configurable sale round start and end date time configurable vesting start time cliff and period configurable number of token to be sold token claim is allowed only after the sale round is completed and can be configured also a cliff period not mandatory to allow claim in small portion over a certain period of time configurable token to be claimed it is not necessary to develop the token to be claimed before sale round start this will give you more time to think about tokenomics and feature of your erc token that will have to be developed it is possible to invest into the sale round with stable coin such a usdt usdc etc requirement of decimal digit per erc token it is possible to invest into the sale round with ether it depends from which blockchain is deployed the smart contract so it would be eth for ethereum blockchain bnb for binance smart chain cro for cronos etc it is possible to change parameter when the sale round ha already started for further detail and emples deployed on blockchain please refer to the project github repository

0,who verifies the data coming from first party oracle i have been reading up on api and if i am not mistaken one of their distinguishing feature that set it apart from chain link is the idea of st party oracle which i understand to mean the owner of the data originate the data themselves unto the blockchain my question is who verifies such st oracle service like what is stopping such st oracle service to collude with some other player to modify or even delay publication of data in such a y to be beneficial to the party they are colluding with my understanding is this is difficult in theory to do with rd party oracle like chain link since the data are independently sought and then aggregated

0,five trend that will push the adoption of blockchain i s so freaked out on the ongoing saga that the collapse of ftx is dominating the crypto headline and ha led many to write off the industry for good a billion in investors' fund have evaporated with no hope of regaining what s lost according to alender filatov a co founder and managing partner of everx lab there are five main trend that will help the blockchain space surpass billion user within the next to year have you heard about it i didn't doubt that the first of these trend is gamefi which is obviously a popular sector that emerged during the bull market of and introduced a y for gamers to earn money doing what they love i noticed that this year i spent the most time playing blockchain game such a m tournament i think that it's alys the most exciting thing for me when it come to blockchain game these nft ards and the chance to compete with actual player 't you think that one of the most influential sector that will bring about an accelerated adoption of blockchain technology and web could be metaverse what do you think about that the second growing trend is an increase in tokenization and nft utility the third trend cited by filatov a more scalable network will be required to onboard new user and the fourth trend which will likely lead to an influx of money and participant in the crypto economy is an increase in government intervention and the establishment of regulation related to the use of blockchain enabled technology i believe that the long term outlook for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies is positive a the number of builder looking to make their mark on the industry grows

0,ethereum based daos are helping boost adoption and utilize crypto in region like africa and asia this is exactly what ethereum wa created for i remember how vitalik once mentioned that the main goal behind ethereum is to help humanity and society become more self reliant and eventually escape the grasp of tyrannical figure and institution and while this still might be far from happening it is the end goal that all of u a a community are working to eventually achieve it will take time but the goal is there if fact we re already seeing decentralized organization helping out the people who need self governance the most many people living in certain african and asian country are under the full control of corrupt tyrannical government and institution and thus ethereum and ethereum based decentralized project can be the most effective there this is very evident by the fact that the mena region ha registered the highest crypto market growth in plus there are some ethereum based organization like bitdao that are funding subdaos like africadao to help boost adoption in african region and give the people there a taste of well needed self governance this is all very revolutionary but again this movement is still in it infancy but it s progress nonetheless everything need to start somewhere right all i really care about is seeing ethereum and all the project and dapps built on it actually get utilized in the real world and not just that they re being utilized in a y that might end up improving the y of life for hundred of million of people eventually so i m all in for this hopefully i can witness this movement completely unfold in my lifetime

0,future of crypto sorry for the somewhat vague title here but i really am interested what you all think about the future of crypto after this week s event the downfall of both terra and ftx is sure to ignite the wrath of regulator on the crypto space like you all i believe that the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies can help to solve a myriad of societal problem at the same time having worked in the tech industry for two decade it s also clear to me that radical technology like the internet and cryptocurrencies do not alys evolve in an ideal y what i m particularly curious about is what a future with crypto cbdcs and inevitable regulation will look like what will be the role of crypto i ve been thinking about this even more recently and my conclusion is that barring an effective banning of crypto which i believe is pretty much impossible at this point crypto will serve a both a testbed and release valve for fiat policy consider that bitcoin started in response to the financial crisis and exploded in popularity due to unpopular fiat policy particularly quantitative easing it ha also served a an independent safe haven for resident of nation dealing with a failed fiat currency however it ha so far not lived up to the promise of a hedge against inflation the advent of ethereum and unlocking of smart contract is another great emple where cryptocurrencies shined and provided a testbed for financial experiment this would otherwise have been impossible in a strictly fiat world what do you think

0,what do you consider the biggest advantage of ethereum according to coinmarketcap the world now ha nearly cryptocurrencies this make determining which one will be profitable in the long run difficult for investor but my personal favorite is ethereum which is also the second largest cryptocurrency in term of market capitalization there are numerous advantage such a nfts because ethereum is the major blockchain where most of the top known nonfungible token are launched people are excited about ethereum because the market for nfts is expected to reach more than billion in sale by with a percent annual growth rate this suggests that ethereum will be in high demand because it is required to pay fee when producing or purchasing token on decentralized platform like opensea nfts can now be used to accomplish a wide range of task a we all know nfts offer some people the opportunity to make large sum of money however only some people who deal with them become a millionaire everyone is unique and everyone's risk rerd tolerance varies a a result depending on one's perspective nfts can be viewed a either a lottery or an investment in some case regarding nfts in lottery system the lottery industry account for of global gambling revenue this type of gaming is rumored to be coming soon to platform like billionair which is powered by a robust token based economy the airb utility token and nft based ticket these can be used to participate in raffle bet ger on and win the best skill and chance game like the crypto scene evolves so quickly there are more and more opportunity for ethereum and nft holder what is the most significant advantage of ethereum in your opinion

0,crypto gaming need to be fun to be successful money doesn't matter do you agree do you think that most cryptocurrency game today lack the mechanic to keep player interested for even a short period of time i read one interesting article about this and made me think why haven t more top tier game introduced real world rerds into their game i'm referring to title in which of gamers are not professional esports athlete and receive no monetary compensation for thousand of hour spent playing their favorite game the possibility of introducing monetary incentive ha alys been on the table why hasn't it been game need to avoid injecting monetary rerds into an experience that is designed to be intrinsically rerding the gameplay should be most important because that's the thing that keep player attracted to the game and entertained have you seen how awesome m tournament are well that's the ect reason i'm captivated by that game it's insane and we need more game that are fun and worth playing the fact is that nobody will invest hundred of hour in an activity that isn't fun unless it pay a lot of money and you can only pay out a large sum of money if a large number of user collaborate to create a significant amount of value this quickly becomes a death spiral for nascent crypto game a the game are unable to generate enough value to adequately rerd player for spending hour inside an unrerding game loop instead of starting with economics or haphazardly adding crypto to a working game loop developer should create game that people nt to play a play to earn mechanism could destroy the retention of even a fantastic game with high retention number what are your thought

0,the fictitiousness of the consensus algorithm the failure of decentralization and the emergence of nonblockchain the content is very long pre scrolling is recommended definitionthe blockchain is operated based on a plurality of node configured in a pp method countless transaction are submitted moment by moment from client all over the world tords countless node spread all over the world the result of these transaction are recorded on all node and in particular the content should be the same overall in order to realize this the rule that all node must follow is the consensus algorithm to describe it more conceptually it can be defined a a method in which a specific node is selected by a certain rule especially by the decentralization principle the selection and execution order of transaction is determined by the selected node and other good willed node independently verify and execute the content of individual transaction and store them in their database a such consensus algorithm can be clearly defined however many people are misunderstanding this definition the subject of consensusthere is a serious misunderstanding about it of the general public misunderstands this point and most of the dapp programmer who have not built the mainnet themselves are misunderstood or ambiguous this is even shown on ethereum's official website there is no understanding of the definition of the consensus algorithm mentioned above or it is ambiguous the fundamental cause of this problem is the illusion about the subject of consensus in short even though the content of the transaction that's the authenticity of the author is not a subject of consensus it is often mistaken the only subject of the consensus are the selection of transaction and the order in which they are implemented a the content of the transaction ectly the authenticity of the author the transaction that a sends eth to b is electronically signed with a private key and deployed to the blockchain network the authenticity of the transaction creator is judged by each of all pp node it doesn't get help from anyone outside and it doesn't ask anyone outside however most ordinary people and surprisingly many dapp programmer mistake the authenticity of the content or the author's authenticity a the subject of consensus however this is not the subject of consensus but of anti consensus a famous pharase about this is the following do not trust verify a a result even if all other node in ethereum conspired to forge the transaction and store it in the database the honest node doe not care about it at all and verifies the transaction by itself and store it in it own database and new node joining afterrds will follow the honest node b selection and execution order of transactionsthese are the genuine subject of consensus no more no le not all transaction submitted to the blockchain are selected and the selected transaction are not executed in the order in which they are submitted this is because it is theoretically impossible a long a the concept of a block of finite capacity is premised therefore there arises a problem of deciding how many transaction to accept in one block and in what order to execute them it is the problem of the consensus algorithm and in itself this becomes the definition of it i selection of transactionsfor emple assuming that suddenly one billion transaction are pushed in one second it becomes impossible to put them in one block therefore we have no choice but to choose some of them in this case most mainnets collect transaction in the order of high gas price and put them in block therefore even transaction submitted first in time may not be included in the block if the gas price is low they also run later than other transaction with high gas price even if they are contained in block for reference the existing centralized system solves this problem by creating a queue so even if a billion transaction suddenly hit in a second it can theoretically accept and process the whole transaction ii order of execution of transactionsthis is also usually determined based on gas price maybe all the mainnets are doing that and i've never heard of that exception in this case it is natural that the possibility of manipulation occurs the answer of existing blockchain protocol to this are a follows code is law it mean that you are responsible for not checking the law in advance this is simply an irresponsible attitude for emple if an incompetent legislator incorrectly entered the amount of parking fine and added another zero the legislator is not at fault and you are an idiot for not checking the law this is the current state of the blockchain in the dao crisis the law s eventually forced to be revised now it should be law is code the order of execution of transaction must be in the order in which they were submitted at least they should try to do that however the existing mainstream platform insist that the current gas price auction system is the right y offering only poor excuse of course everyone know that it is a lazism the birth of the block conceptas described above the current consensus algorithm have a fundamental problem nevertheless the reason satoshi and buterin adopted this method s to make centralized manipulation impossible in the selection and execution order of transaction that's they sacrificed the general principle of pre submissionism to pursue decentralization by the y in order to pursue decentralization in the satoshi sense the order of selection and execution of transaction must be determined by a node rather than a specific node however if countless client submit their transaction to a myriad of node the unity of the overall database will be broken if the transaction are executed in the order submitted for each node therefore he s forced to seek y to select and order transaction by any random node and to allow other node to accept them to this end it is needed to establish rule on who will make decision on selection and who will follow them a selected by a duly elected selection decision maker other node follow it and execute each transaction and store it in their own database thereby maintaining the overall database uniformity it s the pow that satoshi came up with a a y to determine who ha the authority to make the above selection decision that mean that the person who solves the high level math problem the fastest will be given the right to decide on the selection of transaction however in order to do this you need time to solve math problem and during that period the transaction queue is accumulated at this point satoshi came up with the concept of the very block it is the miner who succeeds in solving the math problem satoshi established a rule that the miner selects all or some of the transaction accumulated during the period of solving mathematical problem put them in one block and executes them and all other node follow the rule the block concept of blockchain s born in this context limitation of the meaning of decentralization in blockchainas such the block concept emerged a a methodical element to make it impossible to manipulate in the adoption and order of execution of transaction it s the best y within the limit of satoshi's intelligence the reason satoshi adopted the block concept s of course to achieve the idea of decentralization despite innumerable problem such a the execution delay of transaction during the block generation time the reversal of the transaction execution order and uncertainty of being selected in the block satoshi believed that decentralization would be guaranteed if a node s selected from among the innumerable good willed node spread around the world and those node determined the selection and execution order of transaction and he thought that if only the decentralization s guaranteed he could endure a number of problem caused by block generation if so it is necessary to calmly emine the advantage of the decentralization compared to the centralization system at the expense of such considerable cost for this it is good to make a comparison in other word it is assumed that there is one centralized node and that this node determines the selection and execution order of transaction and other node follow suit next the decentralization system is compared with this first there is no difference in the content of the transaction whether it is a centralization method or a decentralization method this is because forgery is impossible thus the transaction in which a transfer bitcoin to b work ectly the same on these two system and is also stored in the database in the same y it is also impossible for the centralization system operator to produce the above manipulated transaction from the beginning and both system are the same in this respect however there are difference between the two system in the selection of transaction and in determining the order of execution the problem is that it is necessary to emine whether the difference is essential or relative speaking from the conclusion the difference is only a relative difference and in particular in term of fairness that is prevention of manipulation it can be said that there is nothing better than a centralized system in a decentralized system let's look at this in detail the manager x of the centralized system can arbitrarily manipulate the selection and execution order of the first transaction in which a transfer bitcoin to b and the second transaction in which a transfer bitcoin to c so if x hate b love c and a's current balance is bitcoin x can make the bitcoin which is normal to be transferred to b be transferred to c by manipulating the order of transaction or omitting the first transaction at all satoshi s are of the above problem and a a countermeasure he studied how to empower random node operator to decide the selection and order of execution of transaction the result of the study s mining and the concept that arose a an inevitable result of the mining s the block finally at first it seemed that satoshi's idea could be realized without obstacle if there are innumerable node and an arbitrary or random node operator determines the selection and execution order of the transaction it can be admitted that virtually no one can manipulate it however the reality did not go a satoshi thought the first typical situation s the emergence of the mining king in china he s able to exert the power of the operator of a centralized node to some extent based on the enormous hash power and most of all the critical scene s the dao incident ethereum foundation and a series of sympathizer have artificially manipulated the selection and execution order of the transaction to generate an artificial fork since then countless artificial fork have been implemented in the blockchain ecosystem a a result satoshi's logic of decentralization ha virtually collapsed a an inevitable result the block concept ha now fallen into a relative rather than an absolute concept in the blockchain in fact even if it s not the chinese mining king or the dao crisis there s alys a possibility of manipulation by arbitrary node operator that is the case when a node operator is preparing to manipulate at that time in case he succeeds in mining if he prepares manipulated code and allows the code to be executed when he succeeds in mining or is selected a a validator he can manipulate them for emple with simple code manipulation it is possible to change the selection and order of execution of transaction in a low rather than high order of gas price a such decentralization through mining and block s originally an incomplete method it s not a digital but an analog concept that is on a different level from the absolute concept of the impossibility of forgery by electronic signature and this result applies equally to po whether the stake is large or small a node operator can manipulate the selection and execution order of transaction a long a he is selected a a validator but the problem 't end here it's time to ask a more fundamental question is it reasonable to fundamentally determine the selection and order of execution of transaction based on gas price to say the conclusion in advance it is a manipulation in itself it's nothing more and nothing le than to benefit someone who ha offered more bribe let's look at it in detail in general it is right to execute the transaction received first for emple no matter how much remittance fee are offered to a bank it never change the remittance order because it is a principle of nature to process remittance in chronological order there is no reason to treat this principle differently in blockchain therefore if the order is to be reversed a corresponding unavoidable reason must be presented satoshi's answer to this is a follows by extracting transaction in the order of higher gas price the platform can prevent infinite repetitive attack this is not a reasonable presentation this is a simple security issue and a topic unrelated to decentralization that's it is not an issue to be considered in the stage of building the core of the blockchain that should be considered once the essential structure of the blockchain is completed in other word in the core stage it is right to complete the basic structure so that the transaction are executed in chronological order therefore the infinite repetition attack problem should be considered in the process of considering various secondary problem of the basic structure that ha been completed primarily in the process it is the right programming mindset to devise and install a new appropriate additional device separately also such a device is easily conceivable for emple you can find a lot of great method even at the level of common sense such a conducting transaction in chronological order receiving cost in term of security rather than gas and returning them if there are no problem later unfortunately it is assumed that satoshi did not have time to come up with such an idea a a result the gas cost were forcibly inserted into the core part of the blockchain under the wrong name that's the security cost were inserted under the name of gas cost the aftereffect of satoshi's decision on subsequent blockchains were severe in conclusion satoshi's decentralized method could not achieve it original purpose the selection and execution order of transaction could be manipulated and more fundamentally determining them based on the gas price is just manipulation in itself the gas cost priority policy is an unusual manipulation against the common sense that the transaction received first should be implemented first and the reason for that manipulation s also poor in conclusion it is inevitable to raise fundamental question about satoshi's decentralization method that is the block method itself this is not just an issue for bitcoin but a problem for ethereum and all other blockchains disappearance of the blockif all transaction can continue from beginning to end without manipulation and the database can be stored equally on all node the purpose of the blockchain is achieved a curious result emerges here that is the fact that the concept of a block is not necessary to achieve that purpose in addition the fact that none of the existing blockchains achieved the essential purpose of the blockchains mentioned above perfectly at least satisfactorily make u surprised that mean that the block is a failed concept a shown by the comparison of the two system above it cannot be guaranteed that the decentralized pp system of satoshi or ethereum ha special advantage over the centralized pp system instead by adopting a centralized system but strenhening the device that control the central main node to prevent abuse of authority it is possible to make a more fair and unmanipulatable system than the existing decentralized system for emple a main node temporarily monopolizes the selection and execution of transaction and is forced to select and execute transaction in chronological order then the other node monitor it constantly and if it operates against principle disqualify it and appoint one of the other standby node a the main node in any case both centralized pp and decentralized pp cannot manipulate the content of a transaction that's both method already have solved the byzantine general problem the remaining issue are of what to select and how to set execution order but rather a centralized system can operate them more fairly the transaction submited first is executed first and the gas cost may not be received at last we come to a final conclusion the concept of the block is removed a long a the transaction are executed in the order submitted there is no reason to divide and put them in block this is no different from executing transaction in chronological order received by bank or credit card company they no longer need the concept of block the concept of the block s only satoshi's desperate measure and it is by no mean a logically necessary concept to achieve the purpose of the block chain and the most important fact is that it is desirable to remove the concept of a block a much a possible therefore it come to the conclusion that the block concept will eventually disappear the only thing that remains is the transaction chain now the blockchain must be renamed the transaction chain which will revolutionize the blockchain ecosystem the appearance of nonblockchainat least it is possible to remove the concept of block while maintaining the current level of fairness of decentralization in bitcoin or ethereum more precisely it mean that there are theoretically infinite y to eliminate the concept of the block to improve the selection and execution order of transaction while securing fairness beyond the current level of the fairness of decentralization in bitcoin or ethereum then what will the consensus algorithm look like if the block concept is actually removed first of all the chain is made up of only transaction this transaction chain also ha no fear of forgery at least in the content of the transaction a long a pp is the premise there is no fear of forgery or falsification of the content of a transaction whether it is on a centralized or decentralized system if so the only thing left is the selection and order of transaction who will decide them this mean going back to the point when satoshi created bitcoin based on experience over the past year satoshi ha failed on this issue for now therefore we must return to satoshi's initial starting point even if we 't like that and we have to start over from scratch what need to be observed here is one thing and that is enough that's the level of fairness must be above the current level of bitcoin or ethereum complete fairness is impossible it's not impossible in theory but it's practically impossible unless an innovative new technology like rsa emerges the easiest thing to think about is appointing a main node in appointing the main node the status may be endowed permanently or only temporarily the most appropriate answer will be somewhere in the middle of the two it is virtually impossible to appoint and replace the main node only temporarily i e only once for each transaction satoshi s confronted with this very problem at that time satoshi imagined the concept of block and from this blockchain s born and year later it s confirmed that the concept of block s a failure in this case the most common sense that can be thought of is to appoint a main node under a certain standard and constantly monitor it a a method you may use the platform's own code or you may use a smartcontract and if manipulation or laziness of the main node is detected a method of replacing the main node automatically or by poll is introduced even at this level the fairness is not inferior to the former chinese mining king or specific foundation led artificial fork creation above all this method ha the advantage of being able to set the operating standard in advance in a smartcontract a a result arbitrary fork generation is fundamentally blocked this is because the fork generation principle itself that other node follow the longest blockchain ha been removed then it can be said that it is relatively more fair than the existing decentralization system in the end that can be called proof of democracy pod decentralization which is le fair than pod is no longer decentralized eventually the religion of decentralization also collapse many people still believe in this myth it is superstition because there is no technical basis the trustlessness ha a technical basis called a electronic signature however there is no such definite technique for the permissionlessness an essential element of decentralization a demonstrated above the block failed the decentralization ha failed in both theoretical and practical y therefore in this situation calling for decentralization is nothing more than calling for it a a simple ideology it is no more than a cry for th century anarchism decentralization without technical support is nothing more than a mere cry of ideology in reality pow and po are also fundamentally operated under the control of pod they are no longer decentralized thing let's look more specifically pow is not a mining certification method but a mining manipulation method a can be seen from china's mining king po is also only a method that can be manipulated by stakeholder there is currently no technology or method to prevent the manipulation the dao crisis and the numerous fork that have been conveniently attempted since then only prove that the blockchain is accepting democracy it ultimate bastion that is it may be seen that the pow or po is only a kind of pod at present in other word all existing consensus algorithm are pod pure decentralization independent of democracy doe not currently exist therefore the method of selection and ordering of transaction can only be explored based on pod at present advantage of nonblockchain satoshi's block ended in failure however it ha since become the standard for all blockchains most blockchains fundamentally do not deviate from satoshi's basic framework eventually all of them disappear or remain only for museum use personally bitcoin's block will survive forever on the other hand ethereum is very unstable there is absolutely no reason to maintain the block concept in the ethereum c ethereum's attempt to maintain the current block concept is an obvious long term impossibility nonblockchain ha many advantage once you can stick to the principle that is transaction may be executed in the order of reception or submission a in the previous emple if the tree method with the main node a the top is applied transaction can be executed in the order received by the main node furthermore all transaction can be accepted without omission this is the same a the queue concept in a general computer o there is nothing special the nonblockchain would normally adopt a tree structure of course in preliminary the horizontal pp method of the current blockchain may be adopted a an auxiliary method it depends on the mainnet developer's choice anyy if the tree structure is adopted it can boast the fastest speed theoretically there can no longer be a rapid structure the nonblockchain doe not require a concept such a gas price to determine eligibility to be included in a block because the concept of a block doe not exist in the first place it is enough to accept and implement in fact the gas cost of existing blockchains are virtually irrelevant to the node's operating cost this is because the execution of transaction and the storage of data are performed in all node but the gas cost are only probabilistically paid to miner or validators to be ect gas cost should be distributed fairly to all node in this respect the existing gas cost system is extremely unreasonable instead it is desirable to institutionalize a separate method of payment of operating expense newly and that is possible but that will not be specifically mentioned here the real purpose of existing blockchains collecting gas cost is not for operating expense the mining rerds are sufficient to pay operating expense in fact the real purpose of the gas cost s security cost this is being confessed by ethereum's official site in short gas fee help keep the ethereum network secure by requiring a fee for every computation executed on the network we prevent bad actor from spamming the network the nonblockchain collect security cost not gas cost if malicious intent is not positively recognized due to the review the collected gas cost will be returned in this y the security cost may be set high enough without resistance eventually by returning the gas cost they become zero a described above the advantage of the nonblockchain are considerable and there are no theoretical or practical obstacle to it adoption so of course the existing block concept must be discarded and a system consisting only of a pure transaction chain will inevitably emerge the nonblockchain consensus algorithm is bound to be pod for the time being for now we have no choice but to it for the emergence of consensus algorithm that can achieve decentralization in the true sense by a genius who will appear someday until then it will only be in the form of a pod conclusionthe block s just satoshi's impromptu idea the necessity for hash to be contiguous is only between transaction not between block a a result the name of the blockchain itself is meaningless the blockchain is only one method proposed by satoshi to realize the ideology of the transactionchain the block is not the truth the block concept s only one of the myriad y to realize the transactionchain and it ha now reached the point of disposal the byzantine general problem s not solved by satoshi but s just a problem that had already been solved by cryptography it s the electronic signature looking inside the blockchain at the current stage there are no particularly remarkable technology other than the electronic signature other technology are only those that have already existed or can be developed by ordinary programmer it is absurd to try to achieve decentralization with only such poor equipment in other word the crypto world at this stage doe not have the ability to realize the ideal of blockchain a an inevitable result the consensus algorithm cannot go beyond pod this is the reality of today's blockchain but the spirit of commercialism nt to hide these limitation on the other hand glorify the block to this end they feature the emperor's new clothes the representative clothes are ethereum's future plan the complexity of this plan is indescribable the complexity s all caused by the concept of the block these are temporary complication that will all disappear when the block concept is removed or at least a fundamental platform that heals the problem appears for the time being of course they are successful in dazzling people
0,a lesson from ftx it seems like the biggest takeay after ftx ha been revealed to be insolvent is that cold storage is the only y to go however i believe most people are overlooking the biggest potential concern that can be drawn from it there were giant centralized exchange in cryptocurrency binance coinbase and ftx one of them is now on the brink of bankruptcy there is a huge danger in narrowing that list to two if a large percentage of people decide to sell after what s happened how can we know that coinbase and binance have enough liquidity to facilitate withdrals one of the first thing that happened during the great depression were mass attempt to withdraw cash from bank who did not have that cash on hand stable coin are not a solution if you can t sell them you can t spend them tether limited is not the federal reserve no matter how much usdt is minted they cannot create more usd out of thin air i m are of tether limited s claim that usdt is backed but with the massive increase in price across the market that we ve seen over the past two year the reserve of cash in comparison to the rising price ha to be dwindling i m not trying to fear monger but people should be more concerned and should be demanding more transparency for centralized exchange ledger or trezor llets cannot be frozen but if centralized platform t have enough cash to pay out to those who nt to sell then it completely undercut any value proposition for cryptocurrency regardless of whatever the price is or how much your llet is saying it s worth

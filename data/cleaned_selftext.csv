0,using electric water boiler to mine bitcoin the energy produced by mining will be turned into heat in the end so wouldn't it be possible to use high end bitcoin miner to create device which are normally just meant to produce heat like an electric sto a washing machine or electric water boiler erytime you boil your water you'd ha a small chance of basically winning the lottery so your mining activity is basically for free besides of the more expensi device in the end this would make mining le profitable for miner maybe mining will only be profitable if the energy is used to heat up something else maybe a water boiler is a bad exle since you probably only use it a few time per day but for something you use regularly maybe ha it running the whole day maybe some industrial device in factory or at least in electric heater when home 't ha a traditional heater

0,definition of inflation and deflation i d like to discus the various meaning of deflation and inflation i ha seen the usage of these word vary a lot in medium and finance while i ha a decent understanding of what is going on i often get confused by the conflated use of these word and would like to clear some thing up from my current knowledge i see inflation a being an increase in broad money supply for the fiat system this is best described a an increase in m for bitcoin it would be described a an increase in supply of bitcoins furthermore the rate of inflation is just the derivati of broad money supply basic calculus for bitcoin this is extremely easy to calculate based on the current halving cycle i e block subsidy and it sits around for fiat this is more complicated nebulous and volatile a of today the yoy increase in m is about due to recent rate hike but it wa obviously much higher in the past year financial institution try to measure the inflation rate using cpi but this is blatantly biased and flawed since inflation effect eryone differently and the basket of good is er changing on the other hand deflation is the decrease in broad money supply i won t go or the meaning agains since it is pretty much just the opposite of inflation hower i would like to better understand how bitcoin is deflationary a bitcoin entually reach it hard cap of million it will become neither inflationary or deflationary i m not sure if there is a technical term for this but i ll call it sound in this state of sound money i understand that the price of good will deflate in relation to bitcoin a they already ha in the past while this make sense to me i belie it is a misnomer to call bitcoin deflationary bitcoin would only be deflating if it supply wa decreasing can someone please help me clear up these semantics

0,the slow death of bitcoin one of the key feature of bitcoin is that it ha a finite supply of million coin this mean that there will ner be more than million bitcoins in circulation according to the bitcoin protocol mining will continue until the year at that point the block reward for mining new block will be reduced to zero this is known a the halving of the block reward a a result there will be no more bitcoins created after this point once all million bitcoins ha been mined the only way for miner to earn reward will be through transaction fee these fee will likely be much lower than the current block reward and it is uncertain whether they will be enough to sustain the mining industry my question do you belie that this could lead to a slow death of the bitcoin network a fewer miner will be incentivized to maintain and secure the network

0,bitcoin a global reser currency and the bitcoin economy a thought experiment tl dr based on some thought experiment the price of btc could go crazy high t btc if it were being used a the global reser currency and used for eryday expense hower a new global system run on btc would be more financially restricti and potentially much le extravagant due to deflationary impact and significant reduction in credit loan but at the benefit of no boom bust cycle and no recession it would be the financial discipline we all need but 't want finally you can't hoard all your btc if you want to see this future come to pas or it'll ner come thank the btc pizza guy for his first sacrifice we all imagine a wonderful future where bitcoin sers a the backbone of value the primary and absolute global currency hower i wa thinking about some implication through various thought experiment and there may be some challenge for a bitcoin future we need to wrestle with i wa also thinking of what the bitcoin price might be if it were used a the global reser currency thought experiment the bitcoin village imagine there's a village with only two people in it jack and jill jack owns bitcoin and jill owns none the total value of the village is bitcoin use that's all that's in existence in that village jill decides to build a house and agrees to sell it to jack for bitcoin now jill ha btc and jack ha btc the value of his house which is btc the total value of the village is now btc en though there are only btc in existence key takeaway jill created btc worth of value by building a house the economy can be worth way more btc than the actual number of btc thought experiment the village grows so now ten new people decide to mo to the village they ha no money so they need to work jill decides to hire them to build more house so she need to gi them some of her btc let's say jill gi them each btc to build one house each the village now ha new house hower the total supply of btc is still and jack doesn't want to spend his last on another house so he want to pay le for another house jack agrees to buy all house from jill at btc each the value of his original house just dropped from btc to btc a huge drop but on the other hand his btc somehow me a lot more valuable use he can now buy way more house for the same money jill is now rich a well having just sold a bunch of house she continues to gi work to her new employee and they pay jack a little btc each month for rent a more and more people start pouring into the village the btc is starting to spread around and thousand of house are created yet the value of each house necessarily need to decline use there just isn't enough btc to go around in fact this happens to just about erything in the economy food energy entertainment etc price keep declining and declining a thousand and million of people flood into the village you can now buy entire house for just a few satoshis key takeaway a btc is being more heavily used by more people the price of erything in btc ha to drop in order to keep them affordable so anyone hoarding btc benefit big time since their btc can buy more and more each day so therefore extreme deflation in btc occurs a the adoption of btc rise and the economic activity of btc increase thought experiment the castle by now jill is super wealthy en though she only ha btc she's the richest person in the village use that btc can buy ton of house and just about anything she desire jack decides to build a gigantic castle and offer it to jill for btc she doesn't ha that much and that's more than the entire btc in existence in that village but she want it really bad jack gi her the house but tell her that she ha to pay him pack her debt to jack is now btc interest she faithfully pay jack btc ery month from money she get from her rental from the villager the villager keep getting their salary from working for jack and after a long time the debt is paid in full key takeaway the amount of debt in the village can far exceed the total amount of btc available that debt can en be repaid fully or time en though the debt is greater than the total number of btc orall realization deflation traditionally economist 't like deflation use they say it will negatily impact economic activity use why would you spend money today if you know your money will be worth more tomorrow why did jack spend btc on a house when maybe he should ha waited until the house would be cheaper later well i think this is ry true en for u today with btc why should we buy a cup of coffee with our btc when we know that btc might be worth thousand of dollar in the future think of the guy who bought the pizza for btc ouch so we're all wanting this btc economy but few of u are willing to jumpstart it use we want to hold on to our btc due to deflation but the biggest rise in the value will only really kick in if we actually start using our btc so it's necessary we can all thank the btc pizza guy and i think we should all do our part and start using our btc except me i'll hoard debt exceeding the currency we talk about how it doesn't make sense for our current economy to ha more debt than currency in circulation but i think that's workable a shown in the thought experiment hower printing money to meet a deficit is definitely no no so the btc village sol that from happening so a btc economy that us loan and where debt exceed the total amount of btc is totally fine since the value of the orall economy in btc can far far exceed the number of btc in circulation entually there won't be enough btc to pay for buying selling for exle if i wanted to buy a house from you and you needed the btc paid in full there may not be enough btc to pay you bank won't be able to print btc out of thin air to gi you and so that i can owe to the bank yes there may be people lending out their btc but access to credit will be significantly reduced compared to today perhaps that's a good thing more balanced approach to society we won't ha bull market and bear market and recession but perhaps at the expense of what more disciplined lifestyle of le consumption i think that's the natural trajectory of this new economic structure max price of btc could become extremely high well unlike dollar btc is a ry hoardable asset due to the deflation mentioned abo imagine if million and million of people decided they wanted to hoard btc or more so that really the only btc in circulation to pay for thing were just btc the price of btc would explode out of control of course thing would equalize a bit use all the hoarder may want to go out and buy thing with their new wealth but there will always be significant pressure to hoard in btc instead of today's norm which is to hoard wealth in stuff other than cash hoard value in house hoard in stock etc and this pressure will ha a major impact on the value of btc if only btc were remaining for transaction and the rest were hoarded then the value of btc would be equal to the current value of all currency which is about t there's about t of currency in circulation globally or if we say only the currency of usd it would be worth about t per btc there's about t in usd in circulation if nobody hoarded btc and all million btc were used a cash is used today then each btc would be worth about k based on the t usd in circulation

0,hard money question one of the argument for bitcoin is that it supply is not controlled by any entity so the gornment cannot just pump more money and cause inflation like we ha seen in the last couple of year but my question is if there can be a vibrant financial sector lending bitcoin doesn't that also alter the supply of bitcoin in a way that can actually ha a similar effect a the fed pumping fiat like i understand that there can be no new bitcoin created by lending it but if people use centralized exchange en though they shouldn't i feel like we would run it a similar problem i e boom and bust cycle no

0,why ftx u president left tweet thread unrolled from brett harrison's latest tweet an hour ago spilling the bean many ha asked question about my time at ftx u and why i left when i did a i indicated earlier this week i m happy to begin sharing my experience and perspecti publicly i worked at ftx u for senteen month when my resignation wa made public those unfamiliar with my plan were surprised and some questioned whether i d been fired it seemed a though i d left a dream job abruptly after a ry short tenure the truth wa that ftx u hadn t felt to me like the dream job it appeared to the industry and medium for some time and my departure wa not abrupt my relationship with sam bankman fried and his deputy had reached a point of total deterioration after month of dispute or management practice at ftx and a a group of my friend mentor and instors knew then i d felt such a strong conviction to found my own company that it wasn t worth keeping a dream job no matter the prestige or upside no matter the risk it posed to my reputation in departing so early sam asked me to join ftx u casually or in late march he wa my former colleague at jane street and i had fond memory of his presence there we d barely stayed in touch or the year but i d occasionally read news about ftx s growth i wa happy to hear from him and interested to learn more about how thing were going at ftx i d known sam to be a conscientious junior trader at jane street who d e well in the programming for trader course i taught there in which he d been my student in manager meeting about sam s performance the senior trader on his desk indicated he had promise beyond that he seemed like a sensiti and intellectually curious person who cared about animal and that endeared him to me my negotiation to join ftx u mod quickly a welcome contrast to the month they d taken for ery mo i d made in traditional finance i d built software for jane street s crypto desk in but hadn t worked on crypto since i wa excited to di back in my first few month at ftx u were wonderful i worked largely independently of sam to grow a u based team and foster a professional environment prepared for regulated business i made plan with the ledgerx team built out legal compliance and operation department with first in class lateral hire and began setting up and building a u regulated retail stock brokerage ftx u s spot exchange wa growing in market share the team wa dedicated and producti customer feedback wa positi i wa excited about the future but from the start i noticed that while sam wa rarely engaged on the u business decision impacting the u would come without warning from the bahamas six month into my time at the company pronounced crack began to form in my own relationship with sam around then i began advocating strongly for establishing separation and independence for the executi legal and deloper team of ftx u and sam disagreed i saw in that early conflict his total insecurity and intransigence when his decision were questioned his spitefulness and the volatility of his temperament i realized he wasn t who i remembered i wasn t sure what accounted for the dramatic change i saw in sam like many of u i ha family and friend who li with addiction and mental health problem and i seen how these problem often manifest without much warning in early adulthood i thought that might be a contributing factor and initially felt sympathetic but i didn t know sam well enough personally or ha any real time to reflect on the question i wa in a business relationship with him and he wa making a number of decision about running a business that i disagreed with there wa tremendous pressure not to disagree with sam but i did so anyway at that time and for all of my time at ftx u his influence or the medium ftx s partner the nture capital industry and the traditional finance industry wa pervasi and unyielding standing up to an insecure prideful manager is hard under any circumstance but it s nearly impossible when ery day ery major voice of culture and commerce deafens you with a narrati that implies if you disagree with your manager you clearly must be wrong i wasn t the only one at ftx u who disagreed with sam and member of his inner circle ftx u wa staffed with experienced professional from u finance firm law firm and regulated exchange our collecti experience and professional acumen were frequently treated a though they were irrelevant and valueless it wa extremely frustrating for all of u or the ensuing month i further argued for enacting a sensible hiring policy for staffing ftx u with a c suite of experienced officer for transparent communication between sam and ftx u leadership for gary wang s and nishad singh s software delopment responsibility to be formally identified and shared across a larger group for the delegation of managerial responsibility and control beyond sam and bahamas based executis and other important matter sam wa uncomfortable with conflict he responded at time with dysregulated hostility at time with gaslighting and manipulation but ultimately chose to isolate me from communication on key decision making it felt terrible i sought out information about decision that had been made behind my back desperate but trying hard not to show it in early april my elenth month i made one last try i made a written formal complaint about what i saw to be the largest organizational problem inhibiting ftx s future success i wrote that i would resign if the problem weren t addressed in response i wa threatened on sam s behalf that i would be fired and that sam would destroy my professional reputation i wa instructed to formally retract what i d written and to delir an apology to sam that had been drafted for me that ent solidified my decision to lea i knew an abrupt departure would be harmful to the company and my ftx u report and i wanted to best position the company for future success after i left so i gradually wound down finished building and releasing the u stock brokerage and saw ftx u employee through their mid year review and with that i shifted my focus to the future and to my own company the information that is now in the public record from indictment complaint guilty plea or otherwise show fact that en now after month are difficult for me to assimilate into reality i raised concern at the company believing that the management and organizational issue i saw were typical of growing start ups and that my role a an experienced financial service executi wa to correct them and unlock the next stage of the company s growth i ner could ha guessed that underlying these kind of issue which i d seen at other more mature firm in my career and belied not to be fatal to business success wa multi billion dollar fraud it s clear from what ha been made public that the scheme wa held closely by sam and his inner circle at ftx com and alameda which i wa not a part of nor were other executis at ftx u i understand now why they carefully concealed their criminal activity from u we ha extensi professional network our own line of communication with u regulator and our own authority to speak to u medium if any one of u had suspected let alone learned the truth we would ha reported them immediately or my senteen month at ftx u my colleague and i dedicated erything to serving the need of our customer and growing real business we belied offered consumer a way to more equitably access financial service that are central to their li ancient form of greed and dishonesty destroy trust and corrupt progress the scale of this particular instance of this lesson is difficult to comprehend but far from exceptional in the twel year of my professional experience in finance it s a strange dissonance after i left ftx u and up until nomber nearly ery conrsation i had with a nture capitalist about my new company entually came around to the same kind of question is ftx insting is sam okay with you doing this do you mind if we confirm with him after that many conrsations entually came around to the same kind of apology we know you weren t invold in what sam and others did but we can t take on the pr risk of associating oursels with ftx no matter how capable you are or compelling your idea is the last few month ha provided me with a valuable character study of the industry some treated me like an entirely different person ornight some immediately offered sympathy and support it will be a difficult experience to forget it will also be difficult to forget the frenzied and baseless accusation leled against me on social medium for exle that my resignation could only mean i had knowledge of a criminal scheme en though there s no evidence of that and available information show the scheme wa run by a small number of people in another country and began year before i joined ftx u or that i m seeking a plea deal en though i han t been accused of wrongdoing and am not a target in any instigation or that while at ftx u i colluded with citadel to manipulate tokenized stock price yes people are actually saying this i m grateful from the bottom of my heart to those who showed me unwaring trust and support through the turbulence of the last two month they helped me cut through the noise and remain focused on the future en a they themsels had been harmed by the tragedy of ftx s collapse i credit them along with my family with getting me through the most devastating and destabilizing ent of my professional life i m extremely honored to ha them a partner the path ahead of me is clear now and i m excited to mo forward together with them source

0,my personal thought and feeling about bitcoin being ideology bitcoin represents different thing for eryone but in such a polarized world i find refreshing that people can stand side by side for something that they belie en though their reason to belie it is different some people here for having the option to keep their saving out of the hand of any institution some just belie the number will rise some actually think this will free people and provide eryone a better future a good thing about bitcoin that it aligns incentis and since the incentis are all aligned en if someone here for the altruistic reason or selfish reason it doesn t really matter and that s a good thing and i feel hope real hope for the future maybe for the first time of my life that we can still unite and build something together slowly but surely i ha difficult time to understand why people care about it so much and feel the need to talk badly about it if they belie it will go to zero dollar i t understand the hate or frustration behind it a a counter argument one can say the bitcoiners show a similar attitude towards shitcoins but i think the real frustration there is not related to the pricing of other coin the frustration is there use bitcoin represented and understood by lot of people under the umbrella of cryptocurrencies and the scammer using their fabricated and controlled currency is damaging to what bitcoin is trying to achie this is a long road and i myself still ry new to this ecosystem and when you think about it and know erything started from people and now country discussing it some accepting some refusing energy company starting mining it feel difficult for me to go back to zero but a i said at the beginning apart from the price perspecti it is really refreshing for me to be able to belie in something and do something for it it wa something that i can feel lacking for my generation so i m happy to be be here and be a part of this journey

0,did gold really ha use value before electronics hey all i' been going down the rabbit hole these past month there's a thought i'm trying to work through and i wa wondering if someone could sharpen my thinking on this i would appreciate it if you could either correct any missing information or lapse in logic so i wa listening to a debate between greg fo peter mccormack and peter schiff one of schiff's argument wa money can only work if it commodity money he ga the exle that if the gold price for whater reason start plummeting it cannot go to zero reason being it will be bought up by industry for their use value namely electronics dental filling and jewelry or sculpture art schiff claim bitcoin can go to zero use there is not use value in the physical world no one need it for computer part no one can eat it etc i find this argument to be incorrect i can't find the exact year but it seems like gold wa first utilized a component in electronic device in the early s that lea thousand of year where gold's only use value wa in dentistry and jeweler i think we can dismiss jewelry a a use case for gold why use jewelry is about signaling power and wealth why not wear a necklace made with fool's gold they could make it just a pretty with a nice yellow shine if there wa another another magical metal in history that had all the property of gold plus it wa only accessible by a word phrase that only the bearer know and can teleport it to the other side of the world would there be a demand for jewelry made from this magic metal meanwhile would the demand for gold jewelry go down considerably i think so it's accurate to say gold's property a a money make people want to make jewelry out of it not that people desire to make jewelry out of gold use it a beautiful shiny malleable metal gold jewelry is kind of a side effect or application of gold's value it doesn't seem like a use case to me use once gold's monetary value is gone most of the demand for gold jewelry will disappear in regard to dentistry there's a bunch of other metal that can be used including silr so the conclusion i'm coming to with this reasoning is other than dentistry gold wa largely a useless rock up until it wa used for electronics it functioned a a money for thousand of year use of it's chemical property lend well to use a a money if gold ha function with almost no use case in the real world for thousand of year why can't bitcoin doesn't this mean schiff's argument is kind of weak here one thing to add doesn't bitcoin ha use case in cyberspace there's facebook code that siphon data which is more valuable than a real world commodity like oil

0,multi ndor multi sig sparrow wallet one of if not the best self soreign solution to self custody there is a lot of fear around setting up a multi sig wallet whether it's the setup itself or the fear of restoring the wallet from scratch it can be intimidating to mo from single sig into the wonderful world of multi sig but it's worth it a your stack grows to be a more and more substantial part of your wealth so will the fear of losing your stack via a single point of failure with single sig i know that there are way to create redundancy and security with single sig e g sd card wallet backup multiple seedphrase location passphrases but i would argue that if you are willing to create redundancy and extra security with single sig you already ha the motivation and likely the technical expertise to mo to multi sig so enter multi ndor multi sig sparrow first why multi sig in general there are two major compelling reason for multi sig redundancy from single key loss or theft this one is obvious plausible deniability in a wrench attack this second one wa the main one that made me mo to multi sig in the er increasing world of data leak and kyc it ha become almost impossible to stay incognito a a bitcoiner having multi sig make the effort to physically coerce you so much more difficult if an attacker ha to transport you to another location especially if it's a public place like a bank security deposit box and a multi sig becomes the norm then physically coerci attack become le tempting a a whole in the space second sparrow wallet make multi sig setup a breeze to start it's open source the ui is so much more user friendly than electrum and it automatically prompt super important step like downloading the backup script to restore the wallet it ha been formatted to work seamlessly with almost all the major hardware wallet finally why multi ndor multi sig why not just coldcards in a of setup or trezors in a of setup by creating a setup where no ndor ha a quorum of key e g coldcards bitboxes trezor you remo that tiny little worry that one of the company could be malicious and ha somehow gotten your key either via a usb connection or incomplete entropy at key generation or that you' been the target of a supply chain attack technically you should en be able to trust closed source hardware wallet e g ledger in a setup like this still recommending open source though a a matter of principle in the bitcoin space hower if you go down this route these are the absolute imperatis to setting up a multi sig wallet you must backup your wallet and store a copy of all the xpubs preferably in both electronic and physical form if you need to restore your wallet from scratch you will need the xpubs of all the key not just a quorum this is by far the biggest pitfall of multi sig luckily sparrow prompt you to create this backup at the time of wallet creation at least preferably all of your hardware wallet need to be able to rify the multi sig wallet including the xpubs of all signer on the device i won't go into too much detail but malware could insert additional cosigner at the time of wallet creation so you need an external validation of the wallet setup hardware wallet that i know can do this from personal experience are bitbox coldcard and foundation passport i'm sure there are others but i can't speak to those this applies to both single and multi sig but you should always rify send and recei address on the hardware device itself i will plug for foundation passport on this one they make recei address rification via qr code ry streamlined there's a lot more to the actual use of multisig including using psbts with certain hardware wallet but these actually 't differ from single sig other than having to do it multiple time rather than just once per transaction i could go on and on about other aspect of v of storage location of key seedless setup but this post is getting long if you are interested in seeing sparrow in action with multi sig here's a great video that finally prompted me to go with sparrow s multisig start at

0,btc price forecast discussion id like to offer a few chart i' been working on for an open discussion all opinion thoughs and suggestion are welcome a few note to begin orange rtical line is a halving date green line is top forecast for next cycle the date chosen is the arage time to top from the previous halvings line of best fit is exponential look linear on a log base graph chart y axis is log scale base first chart halvings top estimate k second chart halvings top estimate k third chart previous low to current low top estimate k discussion it's interesting to see the lower the timeframe that the chart look back the lower the forecast high of the next cycle is i belie the reason is due to the diminishing blow off top we are seeing from cycle to cycle i ha a theory for that bitcoin network access to new fund the first cycle bitcoin gained access to a new pool of fund first mors the second cycle bitcoin also gained access to a new pool of fund through a rise in exchange providing easy access the third cycle bitcoin gained access to new fund through a large increase in medium corage the fourth cycle current cycle bitcoin didn't gain access fund that would make a significant a step change to the price a it had in previous cycle a such the lack of blow off top in the current cycle effect the best fit price forecast more significantly when the time period examined is lower so where should the top estimate fall with such a wide range showing in the chart between k and k with no significant increase in access to new fund i'm looking at k a a top if seral larger nation start to adpot btc a legal tender i'm looking at k a a top if seral larger nation and institution gain access through clear and favorable regulation then i'm looking at k a a top i belie on a log scale these ents ha a similar impact to the previously discussed ents in past cycle such a first mors rise in exchange and increase in medium conrage we are currently at k suggesting from the current value we see a increase to the top of the next cycle the better question i think is what should an exit strategy look like well we currently ha day until the next halving and day until the estimated top based on previous cycle cycle wa day from halving to top cycle wa day from halving to top with year to top an exit strategy is a tough question to consider especially considering the swing in monetary policy or the last year for now i'm looking purely at the time to top and it correlation with the halving the halving ent inherrently form a supply demand crunch causing upward pressure on the price significant upward price always lead to fomo and hence an orshoot on true val a we ha seen in ery cycle the time duration of this orshoot ha always been roughly the same in the btc space again day in the past cycle if there is one thing i am willing to rely on it is that human nature repeat itself this date for those curious is th of october what would ha me re evaluate the estimated top date is if one of the aformentioned ents large nation adopting btc and institutional access occurs month after the halving in which case i think we could see the top date pushed further out due to a late boom in access to new fund in this case i would start to look at the k to form the basis of my exit strategy rather than a set date let u know your thought a a final though provoker we often see an estimate cap put on btc due to it similarity to gold a a store of value digital gold the valuation of the gold market is roughly t hower is estimated to be ish physical to paper ratio why do we not see this considered when corrilating it in a store of value sense to btc not financial advice

0,exponential growth understanding and the lack there of a it relates to btc in which i wa speculating on btc s usd price to exceed k in and entually become the global reser currency within year let get into it human being ha a hard time understanding exponential growth for a number of reason one of the main reason is that our brain are wired to think in linear term we are used to thing growing or changing at a steady rate and exponential growth doe not follow this pattern exponential growth is characterized by a rapid increase in which the rate of increase itself increase this mean that the growth becomes faster and faster or time a common exle of exponential growth is the concept of compound interest if you inst a certain amount of money at a certain rate of interest the amount of money you earn will increase or time hower the rate of increase will also increase so the longer you lea the money insted the more it will grow this can be hard for people to wrap their head around use it go against our natural instinct we are used to thinking about thing in term of how much they increase by a certain amount or a certain period of time exponential growth on the other hand increase by a certain percentage or a certain period of time which mean that the rate of increase itself increase another reason why human ha a hard time understanding exponential growth is that it is difficult to visualize when we think about growth we tend to think about it in term of physical object or quantity that we can see and touch hower exponential growth is not something that we can easily obser in the physical world it is a mathematical concept that is difficult to visualize which make it harder for u to understand a further reason why exponential growth can be hard to understand is that it is often counterintuiti for exle if you start with a small number and double it repeatedly the resulting number may not seem ry significant at first hower if you keep doubling the number it will entually become much larger than you might ha expected this is use each time you double the number you are adding a much larger amount than you did the time before finally human ha a hard time understanding exponential growth use it can lead to seemingly impossible or unbelievable outcome for exle if a virus were to double in size ery day it would seem impossible that it could take or the world in just a few short week hower this is exactly what can happen with exponential growth it may start off small but it can quickly become much larger than anyone could ha predicted if you are still with me and are having a hard time connecting the concept of exponential growth to bitcoin let me explain bitcoin a decentralized digital currency ha seen exponential growth since it creation in one of the main reason for this is that bitcoin ha a limited supply there will only er be million bitcoins in existence and a more and more people become aware of and interested in bitcoin the demand for it increase this limited supply combined with increasing demand ha led to the price of bitcoin experiencing exponential growth or time hower this exponential growth ha also made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin use of it non linear growth it is difficult to use traditional financial model to forecast the price of bitcoin this ha led to a great deal of speculation and uncertainty surrounding the future of the currency another factor contributing to the difficulty in understanding the exponential growth of bitcoin is the fact that it is a relatily new and highly complex technology the use of blockchain a decentralized ledger that record all bitcoin transaction add an additional layer of complexity to the currency this complexity can make it difficult for people to fully understand how bitcoin work and how it is valued the exponential growth of bitcoin ha been drin by a combination of limited supply increasing demand and the complexity of the technology behind it this growth ha made it difficult for people to understand and predict the future value of bitcoin but ha also attracted a great deal of interest due to the potential for significant return on instment in conclusion human ha a hard time understanding exponential growth use it go against our natural linear thinking is difficult to visualize is often counterintuiti and can lead to seemingly impossible outcome it is important for people to understand this concept hower use it can ha significant implication in many different area including economics population growth and the spread of disease tldr exponential growth is difficult for people to conceptualize use it go against our natural linear thinking is often counterintuiti and can lead to seemingly impossible outcome btc ha already experienced exponential growth multiple time and is still in it infancy dca and hodl

0,privacy in bitcoin is more important that you think good morning i' been in bitcoin for le than two year so i just 't know enough to discus some topic but i wanted to make a statement about how privacy is key to bitcoin success bitcoin is meant to be a form of electronic cash sent between peer it main goal is to grant people a way of exiting the fiat system at least partially and in order to do so bitcoin need to be antifragile but bitcoiners need to be like that too cause there is no bitcoin without bitcoiners you can make sure nobody is taking your btc away by taking your coin into self custody and that's true but many people who ha been on the space for much longer assure that having your key it already enough i strongly disagree with that you need privacy to be antifragile if your coin are kycd you are an easy target for anybody with enough knowledge to trace you gornment included many think nobody is going to take the time to trace you in that way well i think they will a soon a you do something they find disturbing enough and bitcoin success is something they will find so ry disturbing i can't express properly how important a good privacy is for a bitcoiner and i am so worried that the main voice in the space usually just 't care about it cause you only need privacy if you are doing something wrong first of all that's a lie and secondly well who say what's wrong the only way they won't go against you at some point is if they 't know who to go against

0,nakamoto coefficient is way higher than people who say so keep considering pool a a unique entity while it is true that someone lead the pool it is wrong to consider all miner to blindly follow regardless of what happens let's consider an attack on the bitcoin network of more than block rerted if a pool leader wa to attack following miner would mine block on a hacked blockchain after a few block the hacked blockchain might become the longest one difficulty speaking the hacked chain would get considered a a fork by all honest node use it would imply a reorg higher than honest node would automatically discard the hacked chain the word would spread on all social medias than an attack is going on eryone would manually check they are on the good chain at the same time miner in the hacking pool would start taking action no miner would want to mine on a worthless chain and a majority of miner are honest thus they would quit the pool the power of the attacking pool would fall dramatically after that the fork would not recei enough difficulty mined to keep up with the good chain and would die i think this whole attack cancellation could be put to work in le than a few hour plus the attacker would lose insane amount of power to mine on a chain that loses in the end let's remember than the majority of our miner want to make good if they didn't we would punish them anyway so they will ner tolerate their mining power to be used by a malicious pool a soon a a pool is labeled a malicious it's or that make their leader completely powerless and that make proof of work the system with the highest nakamoto coefficient achievable

0,bitcoin exchange standard bitcoin maxi lo the idea of bitcoin becoming a widely used a a deflationary currency and it is often compared to gold a a store of value let s look at the history of the gold standard a a comparison specifically the departure from the gold standard leading up to and after wwii the gold standard wa swapped for the bretton wood system until it wa erased by nixon in the early s executi order enacted under fdr required all american to submit their gold to the federal reser bank after the war the bretton wood agreement signified a change in the global system in which all country in the agreement were required to guarantee conrtibility of their currency into u s dollar with the dollar conrtible to gold bullion for foreign gornments and central bank at per troy oz wikipedia this mean all country exchange for u s dollar backed by redeemable gold but that gold is only redeemable by bank and gornments not your arage citizen now my question is highly theortecial what if the u s enacted a similar order for bitcoin in the wake of a collapsing global market and it wa made illegal for citizen to hold bitcoin the gornment pinning the value of the dollar at a certain number of satoshis there would be a branch of the federal reser devoted to mining rogue mining operation would be highly illegal and other country would compete for maximum mining output this would ha dramatic effect on the delopment of the cryptocurrency industry and on the world there would be many negatis and positis what do you think i t actually think this will happen but it an interesting scenario keep hodling

0,security measure for btc spender ok truth is most of u probably hodl btc instead of using it for it intended purpose a a borderless transparent and pp payment system for the rare gem here who do use it according to satoshi's vision what security measure do you take my first thought is about having completely separate hodl stack and spend stack since transaction are transparent and traceable it would make sense to keep your saving separate from the coin you spend a to not become a target for the most paranoid of u en using different exchange for each usecase could be imho a good idea this let you spend your sat safely and allows you to hodl or sell when necessary without exposing yourself this is probably super basic so what other security measure do you use or would you suggest

0,discussion projecting the reduction of price volatility tldr let's ha a discussion regarding the trend in price volatility not price for btc and ware it heading i would like to see some good analysis on this btc ha been the best performing asset in modern history but this ha come with volatility like no other this volatility while it last is ry much a once in a lifetime opportunity for those who can buy and hold or the long term en if they 't time the market particularly well but better if they do that said it's my understanding that volatility is generally decreasing year by year while this is generally regarded a a good thing for increasing the adoption rate of btc it also mean that the oportunity presented by said volatility will lesson or time we see a lot of price projection during the bull run at least but i 't see many volatility projection yesterday i wa playing around with the simple annual percentage growth on chart and adding a trend line i'm not going to post it here use i didn't keep the result and i wouldn't consider my method to be particularly say it wa all ry rudimentary and not anything i would hang any credibility on i simply obserd that yes volatility is decreasing and therefore the expected rate of annual growth would also likley decrease going forward this doesn't mean that btc isn't still an amazing instment oportunity in addition to all it other societal benifits monetary freedom store of value etc but it doe mean our growth expectation shouldn't be a high a we obserd in the last three halving cycle i say expectation use there are always external factor disaster war new tech that can affect short term price in iether direction i guess what saying is it would be interesting to see more competent analysis regarding the volatility trend and ware it heading

0,what if the u federal gornment attacked bitcoin with a throughput attack a in clog up all the transaction throughput with a bunch of dummy transaction in order to slow down the network and thus discourage it's usage here's how it would work they print a couple billion dollar they buy a million hardware wallet each wallet buy a few hundred thousand sat then an army of bureaucrat sends the sat back and forth to each others' wallet or and or again producing far more than transaction per second and that's all those bureaucrat do all day it's their job and they could then afford to attach super uber crazy high fee to each transaction say worth of sat per transaction essentially crowding out anyone who want to use the bitcoin network to send their own transaction it would dri the fee sky high through the roof which would cause most ordinary people to be turned off from using bitcoin if they kept this up for a few year it would stifle the network and no one would want to use it use you'd ha to compete with those high fee which are artificially drin up by gornmental action it really seems to me that this could be the most effecti way for the gornment to attack bitcoin with just a couple billion which is a drop in the bucket for the u govt hell powell could crank that out in a keystroke they could make ery fee for an entire year be more likely far higher seriously transaction second about million year so for a little or a billion they could make the fee be at least on each transaction making it prohibitily expensi to use the network for any small transaction what are your guys' thought on this

0,i ha big question about bitcoin transaction i'm trying to understand some thing about bitcoin and i' been searching for day watching video reading article none of them ha explained it to my absolute understanding it's frustrating question transaction input where exactly do the input come from i learnt they are utxo's unspent transaction output from previous transaction which transaction and to whom doe ery payment that come to me generate a new utxo so for exle if people ha recently sent me btc to a single address i own do i ha separate utxo's to spend use a input for my next transaction that wa my reasoning and it seemed to be making sense until i came across info that said the input can come from different address huh okay look like they ha a point though use when i check the block explorer for transaction i actually see distinct address a input and output it should mean that ery address can rather only ha one utxo at a time right and multiple utxo's should definitely come from different address but if multiple address are used a input shouldn't all of them be owned by the sender use only the sender should authorise a transaction now if that's the case how is that e use with the wallet i' used trust and binance i 't see an option to select multiple address i own and combine their value when i'm sending btc so what's happening can multiple input only be achied using low lel coding or something when i search for how to send bitcoin from multiple address or similar i 't find anything that answer my question it's a if that's not possible i'm just not getting it for the output i understand but the input han't really been explained to me can someone who understands this from a to z spell it out for me without leaving anything out i'd be really grateful question block confirmation and rersibility many source say that transaction that ha or more confirmation can be considered irrersible okay logically that should mean that with le than confirmation the transaction can be rersed now what i know about block confirmation is that it's the number of block that ha been added to the blockchain after the one that contains the transaction in question so that mean en with one or two confirmation the block is actually on the public blockchain right so if the transaction can be rersed how is that e will it be pulled down from the blockchain funny question what would happen to the block after it meanwhile if you search for can bitcoin transaction be rersed all the answer you get are no so what's really the point here

0,the basic economics of why bitcoin ha value i' been seeing a lot of new people that seem to ha no grasp on the basic of economics regarding currency what gi it value etc i posted this a a comment in another thread that didn't get much attention so i thought i would post it again a it own post to help those who are new to bitcoin or 't ha much understanding of the fundamental value proposition of bitcoin a a currency first you need to ask yourself why the dollar ha any value learn a bit about the history of money the first currency were commodity money they derid their value from their intrinsic use but they were cumbersome to use so we innted paper money that wa backed by commodity such a gold which could be exchanged for it and ga it value in the u fed stopped allowing dollar to be exchanged for gold making our money fiat money with no backing fiat mean command it is created out of nothing by an issuing authority now think about what the federal reser ha been doing and the effect their action ha had on the economy they previously lowered interest rate to interest rate are the cost of obtaining money money that ha no cost to obtain ha no value and an unlimited supply the money supply ha been increased by more than or the last year and much more than that or the previous century you can view the fed's own data here the value of the dollar or the long term is trending toward zero along with ery other fiat currency look at this chart and see how much value it ha lost or time s most money is already digital it's just a database in your bank's serrs that ha name associated with amount le than of the money supply exists a cash it would be impossible for eryone to conrt their electronic deposit into cash bank actually create extra money in the money supply when they make loan reser requirement were suspended in the covid era meaning bank could create unlimited amount of loan with no resers at all this is stuff you would all learn in an intro economics class but it's ry fundamental to understanding why any currency ha value or loses it value money deris it value from being something that is fungible durable divisible portable and limited in supply the more of these property it ha the better it is a money it must ser a a unit of account a medium of exchange and a store of value the better it is at these thing the better it is a money bitcoin ha all of these quality making it useful a money it's much more divisible than the dollar much more portable and more limited in supply so far the bitcoin network ha ner had a major outage or hack it is free and open source with out a central authority so far it value ha only gone up or the long term despite it high volatility in the short term limited supply is essential a currency's potential a a long term store of value many country ha hyperinflated their currency with disastrous result right now around the world many country are experiencing extremely high amount of inflation learn about what ha happened in argentina nezuela zimbabwe hungary and many more country due to hyperinflation it's a crisis around the world almost all the world's country use fiat currency now many people in these country face authoritarian gornments or do not ha access to a stable currency bitcoin ha obvious usefulness to these people a well a anyone else who want an alternati to fiat money that will do nothing but lose value or time

0,assuming bitcoin will need a smaller unit than sat entually how doe that look from a technical point of view due to bitcoin's hard cap if bitcoin becomes the world reser currency and all thing become naturally priced in bitcoin this would mean that each bitcoin and each sat will become more and more valuable a the economy grows i know assuming the economy will grow indefinitely is not a trivial a i'm making it sound but let's just assume it'll be the case for this thought experiment so basically thing will cost le and le bitcoin and we will reach a point when a single gummy bear will be worth le than sat at this point we'll need a smaller unit in order to pay for eryday stuff en a cup of coffee will be worth le than sat entually hell you could say that about almost anything if you go far enough in the future assuming the human race survis till the unirse end so my question are what's the code change needed to make this a reality is it just changing some value on a line of code in github and then of course the majority of the node accepting the change if so where is that line why wasn't bitcoin made infinitely divisible in the first place are there some technical issue that would arise if this wa the case what's the reasoning behind choosing million per bitcoin a the lower limit and not million or billion

0,feeling grateful for bitcoin hey eryone i just wanted to share my thought on bitcoin with the community a a fairly new bitcoiner myself i am constantly amazed by the resilience and strength of this revolutionary digital asset one thing that really stand out to me is the decentralized nature of bitcoin unlike traditional financial system that are controlled by a small group of individual or institution bitcoin is powered by a global network of node that work together to secure the blockchain this decentralization ensures that no single entity ha control or the network making it resistant to censorship and corruption another aspect of bitcoin that i find particularly impressi is it ability to act a a store of value while the price of bitcoin can fluctuate in the short term it value ha consistently increased or time making it a reliable instment for the long haul but perhaps what i lo most about bitcoin is it potential to bring financial freedom to people around the world in country with unstable currency or oppressi gornments bitcoin provides a way for individual to take control of their own wealth and financial future orall i am bullish on bitcoin and can't wait to see what the future hold for this groundbreaking technology what about you guy why do you lo bitcoin

0,replay attack on blockchains one of the easiest attack possible on all blockchains is the replay attack it basically take advantage of hard fork to use a valid transaction from one of the chain and broadcast it to another let s take an exle we create an hardfork called bwef bitcoin wef of course our shitcoin will be shorted on market and nobody will support it but like ethw people will know they can sell it and get fee money you ha btc so you receid bwef trading each for k for free let s dump it quick so you wanna swap you bwef on a website for free money houray in order to do this you ha to send your bwef by creating a transaction and signing it you then sell and get your dollar so you got your k for a shitcoin you didn t want anyway that s just a win right but here is the issue your transaction is public and is also valid on real btc chain so now an attacker can broadcast this same transaction on original chain this could be the buyer of your bwef now the buyer a receid your bwef and your real btc you re sold your btc for k so now let s talk about how to protect from this afaik there is no way to protect from what i just describe the only thing we can do is to avoid interacting with forked chain which can be difficult use most people t use their own node so when signing and broadcasting a transaction they may be sending it to a node of the forked chain so if someone know more about this and would like to correct me share info like how to protect or anything please do i think this would help greatly community
0,willing to buy bitcoin for gift card from amazon danke
0,bitcoin in the far future the only thing i think is missing about bitcoin technology is a way to really slowly recycle itself let me explain imagine in thé far future when all bitcoins will be mined or almost the biggest bitcoin source available will be old storage from our time old account lost bitcoins etc they will probably be an industry trying to found them back in a way or another the amount of lost bitcoin will be massi and compared to thé mining production they will be a time where finding only a single one hard wallet from our time could be worth of multiple year of mining production this is not a sane balance for an economy the non lost bitcoins will be used for thé economy but if they are btc holder who are too big they will own a too big of thé total amount of money to exist let s say a familly for exemple that inherited bitcoin from generation to generation they could or own stupid amount of thing or acting by themsels a a modifier of bitcoin value order of magnitude too high probably with the ability to make price triple or divide by easily if a money like this exist in far future propose who are not privilegied by it will legitimately look away for other solition and probably create other cryptos collectily and decide to use them instead what would be a imo sane thing to do is adding a evaporating rate to bitcoin let me explain to avoid that few people could own too massi proportion of bitcoins and keep the currency viable and fair enough to let people continue to use it we could maybe add a system who could make a small évaporation raté happen so for exemple each year of the btc you own evaporate and go back to the mineable bitcoin pool number can vary this will also allow a renewable and constant suply of new btc this is the most equal option eryone ha the same evapotax we could also balance this in a more fair way like evaporzting bitcoin faster for biggest bitcoin holder abo some cap to avoid people to squeeze this by dividing their wealth into multiple account we will need them to be or nominated to a single person or to a single family and a way to make sure it is not squeezable then let s say that for each time you own x more than the arage account balance to let this method grow with increasing of decreasing population you pay twice more so per year evaporate of your btc abo time the arage balance abo time the arage abo time the arage k m time thé arage etc etc evaporate per year at million time the arage at million time at a billion time etc that also add an incenti to make thé arage people wealthier so it will be really hard to own more than a billion time the arage person wealth who seem like a minimum to keep thing somehow balanced of course that s random number that could be adjusted up or down that will keep the economy somewhat balanced and allow more evaporation to happen and at the same time still allow for big fortune to exist but without having too much inequality capped in this exemple at billion time the arage use after that evaporate per year so basically all of it we could maybe en imagine a system where the under arage balance get a small percentage of wealth evaporated from big one we could say that like half evaporation go to mining and half to slightly lower inequality could be a modest redistributi and fair economical system we need also a way to make people who die inherit their fortune to their kid to avoid the death people account to count among the total number of acti account and if not possible redistributed to the mining pool this way we could ha a monetary system bitcoin like with a fix amount of currency a way to slowly get back potential lost bitcoins trough evaporation a way to slowly gi back bitcoin to the mining pool and keep the suply running a way to avoid too much inequality but still allowing fortune to exist without allowing too indecent one or monopoles to a way potentially to redistribute a part of the wealth to the le fortunate trough a part of the evaporation we could call this condensation on lower than arage or arage balanced account this will be a low amount in any case use lower than arage account and arage account will be much more in number than the abo one who pay for it and that s how you keep a currency system sane stable and fiable for extremely long period of time and make it automatically adjusted to total population number change up or down allowing humanity to entually ume a multi planetary specie a we should be if we are not filtered out of existence before and that s how you also assure people to be able to keep a stable decentralised predictible non inflationist currency who evaporate or not at all or reaaaly slowly depending on how rich you are also putting a smaaaaal pressure on people to spend or inst and keep the money moving in the economy being rich is this world would only mean owning a bigger part of the cake who evaporate faster and of nothing is e or if badly used or lost will go back to arage with time trough evaporation who go half to the le fortunate half for the miner who keep the thing working a bitcoin made on this kind of system could be much more viable long term and en ume a ultimate and unirsal currency alway adjusting itself to any situation to go back to the society wealth distribution programated in some year and still of course remunerating miner and mining who make the system work and continue to that s an interesting topic imo and could be the solution to a lot of issue that today currency ha or en cryptos ha or en decentralised cryptos ha excuse my bad english

0,difference between cold storage and no storage this is probably a dumb question but if you mo bitcoin to a cold storage wallet then i understand that it is not on your computer anymore and that this is more secure a you can't get hacked unless somebody get the cold storage dri and know how to get in but if you mo bitcoin to say an electrum wallet and sa the seed phrase on paper somewhere or in your head and then you delete the electrum app completely from your computer then also you would not be able to hacked via your computer if somebody gained access to it so what really is the difference or pro con of the approach is there anything wrong with just deleting the wallet app and not spending extra money on a cold storage device since you can always recor the wallet with the seed whener you want access to the bitcoin by reinstalling the wallet software

0,help me belie in blockchain technology again lately i ha been having a bit of an existential crisis with the true utility of the blockchain i wa initially drawn in by the digital goldrush but like many i stayed use i really belied in the future of crypto a this bear market ha progressed i ha been filtering through the junk a i di deeper into crypto and blockchain technology i am starting to see le how the blockchain ha real utility here are a couple of my opinion i would lo if somebody with more knowledge of the space could refute anything i say with evidence possibly crypto's greatest strength is the decentralized network and ability to process instantaneous transaction this is especially useful for large payment and international transaction the problem is there no easy way to conrt bitcoin to fiat without using a centralized exchange the argument would be that entually we could use bitcoin or other token a transactional currency but we are still far from there needing to rely on exchange to conrt bitcoin to fiat come with many of the problem that come with transferring money to begin with at the end of the day unless you are transferring crypto from one wallet to another and the receiving party plan on just holding the crypto it offer ry little improment to wire transfer the second issue i ha is with linking token or nfts to physical good despite the blockchain being a brilliant and secure way of tracing transaction since there is no way to link a real physical world item to the blockchain it make tracing item impossible i often hear about using blockchain in regard to the supply chain assuming a qr code is used to track certain item the qr code can always be remod or recreated it would also rely on always scanning the qr code to track it if the code is not scanned then the transaction will ner show up in the case of digital item like nft art it cost so much energy to upload medidata on chain that it is not feasible most nfts rely on medidata serrs to store the nft which make the whole point of having a blochian pointless to begin with you can t hide the medidata for confidential document you t own the copyright to the nft in a legal sense and you can t prent anybody from copying the medidata you own on the blockchain this lead to the last point which is most if not all crypto project are creating solution to problem they innted aside from the obvious pump and dump en legitimate project do not offer real world value it seems like so much of crypto relies on the narrati that we will be socializing transacting and living more in the digital world most project assume one day their project will be useful while that may be the case it seems like we are still far from living in a ready player style world i t know of any project except bitocin that that sol a problem that exists today and sol the problem in a way no other technology could to summarize it seems like crypto is a cool technology that ha ry little practical use in today s world i still lo the crypto world and i want to belie in it but i am seeing le and le a true use for it a i take off the goggles and try to look at erything from a practical and producti point of view the argument for crypto is becoming le and le clear to me please educate me on what i am missing use i know i really am looking to learn

0,bitcoin is a social construct not crypto since bitcoin had a price people ha tried to recreate it but with twist like the owner of this one get a huge chunk of supply then supply get released when mining or this one ha this cool delopment team or technology behind it therefore better than bitcoin these recreation all focused on the idea of bitcoin a a technology when in fact en the technology used to run bitcoin is subject to change at the whim of social consensus take robux for a minute robux is a popular digital asset issued by the robux corporation it ha exchange though mostly underground for fear of reprisal from the robux corporation what is the functional difference between robux using an sql database between their serrs and robux using a private blockchain where only robux serrs can create the proof of work for transfer it still permissioned robux still ha full say or whether transfer en happen between account and robux is still sold by the robux corporation crypto is much more akin to robux in this way crypto is not subject to the whim of it userbase it is only subject to the corporation behind it bitcoin doe not work in this way bitcoin is a social construct the bitcoin core devs ha e a pretty good job at making sure nothing that would upset the people who run the software get through but what would happen if they did new rule block size will now be gb instead of mb the first problem they'd run into is that the new software is not compatible with the software eryone else is running people who run the software would be pretty upset at hard dri space filling up rapidly and fork the project into a new repository you now ha two chain but which chain is bitcoin so that's what i mean when i say bitcoin is a social construct any argument you'd make or which get to be bitcoin is you enforcing that social construct the current construct around what is bitcoin is that the chain that is compatible with the older software get to be bitcoin wait but the original bitcoin github repo get to be bitcoin i hear you scream so let talk about the next problem the original repo would encounter from ignoring the people who run bitcoin when you use a bitcoin wallet and you 't run your own node you use the node that software wallet default to now maybe that software wallet enforces the idea that bitcoin is the core repo but it could just a well decide to enforce the social construct that bitcoin is whater is compatible with an older rsion of the software in fact it probably would do this by default via not noticing that a new client wa en released i mean i can't help but notice that this ry sub ha a link to download rsion of core en though rsion wa released miner and price i can't talk about the role that miner would play into this without also including how the price of each chain would effect the miner if user prefer to use one chain or the other it price will go up which make miner want to mine that chain instead of the other one this mean the chain that go against the user wish is vulnerable to the hashpower of the chain that support user decision being part of the dominant monetary network ha it perk the dominant monetary network is evidence of the strength of the social construct at hand right now the strongest social construct for money is that gornment issued paper is money bitcoin is here to challenge that social construct with it own

wallet use you can start right now without set up you just need someone to tip you i recently discored there is a tip bot that you can use in the bitcoin sub and i think others the great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning wallet and then withdraw your tip or use your own lightning wallet to add sat to your personal tip jar you 't need to if someone tip you sat then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your username and add in sat to it that's the minimum tip then you can use the same command in a message and tip someone else no need to en set up a wallet you can use sat all you want just from your own tip get them and pas them on side note you can send private message to the bot and it will gi your balance or a code to send sat to or recei sat via lightning wallet just using the link on the bot reply to tip type lntip or any number higher than it will tip the person you are replying to if you 't ha the fund available in your account for the tip then the bot creates a lightning invoice that you can pay using lightning wallet use with a wallet setting up a lightning wallet and adding sat to the bot a great guide from double lr tip him if he post in comment i use muun too so you are in luck it work a ry small bit different than you think i am on a phone so this is what i just did to transfer sat from the tipbot balance to my muun wallet ry easy you ll see prior to doing this you must ha the wallet fully set up get your seed phrase word aka your key and write them down and keep them safe then do the rescue emergency pdf thing too it s pretty easy and worth the hassle of figuring it out after that open muun and select recei at the top there are two option button select lightning and the screen will change to a lightning address at the bottom you will see invoice setting select that and you will see a button to add an amount and an expiry time for the invoice press add and enter the amount you want to withdraw from the tipbot balance press confirm and the invoice will change again to the address that represents what you just created an invoice for the amount of sat you entered press copy and the invoice will be copied to your clipboard in your phone open reddit and find a tipbot message it ha the blue link in it you see it ery time a tip is gin press withdraw and it will create the dm format for you once you learn the format ry simple you can create it from scratch like a normal dm but the blue link doe this for you until you learn the format well enough to create it on your own on the dm page created by the blue link there is a spot that say putinvoicehere delete only that simple phrase and then paste in to the same spot and your invoice you copied earlier will appear the line that say withdraw need to stay where it is press send open muun a fast a you can and see if you can beat the withdrawal to your wallet from reddit enjoy fellow redditor it seems like a lot but i m reality step will become step for you and step will also become one step for you so once you learn it it s basically two step lightning is badass enjoy fellow redditor general help some useful faq type

commodity like gold but much easier to transport what are sat each bitcoin is made of a million sat like dollar and cent but with lot more sat per bitcoin to make payment easier what is lightning the bitcoin nextwork is slow and super secure great for transfer of large amount of money but not good for tip and coffee so cler people built a second layer on top and that is the lighting network it allows you to send sat super fast and cheap what is a bot an automated service to help you 't worry about sending message to it a long a you 't change the word it's just like sending a command to a computer and it will return your answer privately do i need a wallet perhaps not you can be gin tip and then check your balance here on reddit and only tip others using your tip a great little circular community but then i do need a wallet yes when you either ha so many tip on your reddit ln bot account wallet that you want to withdraw them fully or use them in the real world then you will need a wallet or if you ha no tip and want to tip then you will need a wallet what's a reddit ln bot account wallet the cler people who made this tip bot made it so you automatically get a little wallet just for use with the bot only attached to your username that the bot can use to track your tip and balance smart what's a lightning wallet a lightning wallet probably an app that you can install the app allows transfer of bitcoin sat to any other wallet great for buying stuff in location that accept bitcoin sending bitcoin or sat to your friend l and for sending sat to fill your tip account where do i get a lightning wallet when youre ready to use one google it and find one you like anything else to know only one last bit if you tip more than you ha availabille or you try to make

0,lightning amount hey all like said i am here to ask about lightning i ha seen a lot of tipps recently sadly ner wa the lucky one to get one d but would like to ask what is the highest amount the bot can tipp and lightning can handle or what the user maybe already send or would send and at which amount it would be more like naaah let it better be onchain and if a lightning transaction fails could it be that some satoshis are missing or are the route first checked and only if the right amount is there the transaction start sry for the question i hope it wa understandable lightning is still new for me i couldnt go a deep a onchain at the moment greeting all and ha a nice day and stay safe and healthy

0,how big wa the ftx scam i ll preface by saying i m not an ftx user but i do ha my theory about what happened the fact that money wa being sent to alameda instead of ftx to me mean the scam wa planned from the beginning what im unsure of is whether the money wa stolen or lost on bad trade im guessing it s both i ha some suspicion i wanna throw around here i figured this would be the best place to get feedback on it the main thing i feel people reading this need to understand is i belie sam planned to use ftx a a crypto slush fund which lead me to the following a i understand it ftx had a lot of derivati future and leraged product these product track the price of an underlying asset and can be complex to me it s quite a stretch of the imagination that sbf wa actually taking all of the underlying position that you could take on ftx if he wa gambling with eryone s money anyway i t en know how you d accomplish some of it in crypto so wa that a scam too any ftx user on here that can comment my question is essentially do you think sbf wa letting people place bet on the price of token without there actually being any underlying transaction cause if that s the case then it make sense why he deleted eryone s balance and trade history and i m also wondering if you were able to go on ftx with a small amount of collateral place a ridiculously leraged bet get it right and cash out your money whose money wa that got cashed out

0,real life adoption happening in this sub i'm sure by now you' seen the ln tip being slanged around in here via bot there u also or other sub that allow this hower i 't think people realize the importance of what this really mean you could tip people on twitter which didn't really catch on it go thru rd party etc reddit also ha karma which is incenti for quality cc who of course rejected the ln tip ability when it wa offered this week ha moon which is built into the sub and and you get issued moon based on post and comment performance etc this wa pretty cool and they ha actual value but it's automatic issuance no one actually decides your post's worth based on their perspecti in come these lightning tip this is not a platform that invited some kind of payment system for helping people based on individual user's opinion btc and lightning's techincal ability mixed with a market's demand allowed this medium of exchange in a typically non market place to come to fruition by simply using a bot to capture command and communicate with lightning it it can be used almost instantly a buying power for anyone with a lightning capable wallet this is a simple a an technical ability meeting a requirement of the free market this isn't some moon getting distributed this is someone deciding hey i found this helpful or funny or whater and i want to gi this person real world spending power instantly now think of ery single application or platform in our world that could utilize accessory pathway for market drin trustless exchange of value i feel btc may be labeled a old to many who may fail to see the discory aspect of it but it's truly so so young in term of being the first trustless peer to peer medium of exchange in human history the table keep getting better set progression not perfection is what win market

0,key exfiltration how a signing device could leak a private key blockstream published an article about how a signing device might leak user private key the premise of this attack is straightforward a hardware wallet can leak the user s secret key by carefully constructing it signature since the compromise happens during signature generation rather than key generation en if the user rifies that her key were produced from strong randomness e g by generating her seed word by rolling dice and then importing them into multiple wallet to ensure they produce the same address it is still possible to execute the attack the solution blockstream is proposing to this isn't quite right though it invols trust in the manufacturer and trust in the software if that software is closed source the solution to this is much more obvious than this nol attempt to secure against it the solution is open source software that is easy to compile and flash onto the device and open source hardware that is easy to rify via a visual inspection against a reference like i said in a comment to a post before s i'm not going to talk about particular exploit use i belie defending against the hacker methodology itself is the best thing user can do especially when exploit are known to attacker but not to defender 't let this scare you away from using bitcoin just get better at your own pace keep your stack at the size you know how to defend a larger stack ha justifies a more paranoid threat model

0,catalyst for bitcoin so from what i' gathered there's multiple catalyst for bitcoin price next year despite a looming recession which is a fact at this point first one is the halning obvious by the end of there should be the peak and preceding that hopefully a long upward trend towards a minimum of k per bitcoin according to model that ha a historical price accuracy of bitcoins value should peak at around m per bitcoin in arage recession last for around month so by the time this one will be or bitcoins price should be around k at the end of next year beginning of second one is the gaap accounting standard next year this law will be improd so that company that hold digital asset on their balance sheet will be able to write them at their fair value currently if the price go down in value but jump back up again company ha to write down the value of the digital asset and can't mark it up starting from next year it will be different which apparently ha been a deal breaker for institutional instors in the past third one is the capital inflow of traditional instors like instment bank pension fund central bank small big country and different fund currently holding digital asset in their portfolio is considered to be risky due to the absence of regulation transparency public disclosings from the beginning of next year january the united state congress will be having a session where the sec and congress will both fight or which entity get to set the rule they both seem to be in a hurry to be the first one which is a positi for crypto instors a the institution feel safer to inst the capital inflow should be somewhere around trillion usd for the price to reach k at the end of next year current price would ha to quadruple so approximately trillion usd would be sufficient total amount of asset held by mutual fund in the u is trillion usd germany ha trillion and uk brazil and switzerland collectily own trillion usd that's close to trillion if of this would go to bitcoin it price would quadruple another scenario would be where we would consider the multiplier effect x of insting in the stock market in which only billion of capital inflow from institutional instors would be necessary to reach a trillion market cap x billion usd trillion i included switzerland use it central bank ha said it's interested in acquiring bitcoin there's a few other potential catalyst in the future that might shape the perception of cryptocurrencies to a positi in the coming year big country like iran russia adopting cryptocurrencies to evade sanction and the pilot of cbdcs also ukraine is one of the largest bitcoin holder so there are multiple concrete thing to look forward to in next year and especially the year after despite the coming recession the biggest factor for a long bear phase are imo rising oil price and interest rate until the end of next year in addition to that revolving and non revolving credit are at an all time high while the saving rate of american is at an all time low if the recession will last around month it should be a relatily sound timing for the price to shoot up to k per bitcoin during the third picture is metcalf's law which predicts the value to be minimum k by it's not a delicious a the other two model but still decent considering the fact that it would be the minimum value according to this model the value would be minimum m usd during and hor abo m until it reach during next decade these are just some thought thing i' gathered hope someone find it useful cheer

0,what's lnurl and bolt a you might know the lightning network started back in march and sers a payment layer to scale the transaction speed of the bitcoin network and reduce the cost per transaction at the same time due to the lack of liquidity it wa really hard to actually send payment at the beginning while it me easier to participate in the network there are still challenge to sol in order to make it accessible for the broader mass one of the main problem is the need to create an invoice each time you want to recei a payment from a ux perspecti this is absolutely horrible lnurl and bolt try to sol some of these issue which i will try to explain in the following part lnurl what exactly is that lnurl is a stack of simple protocol for coordinating information needed to make payment or the lightning network using the full list of lnurl protocol piece can be found here but i'm just going to go into a few core us that orlap with bolt the three core feature of the lnurl protocol are defined a lnurl auth where a public key can be used to log in to a service lnurl pay where a wallet can ping a serr through a static qr code and retrie an invoice lnurl withdraw where a wallet can ping a serr and request that the serr pay an invoice provided by the walletfor using the authentication protocol the serr provides a randomly generated number which the user's wallet sign with a newly generated key after the serr retries the signed randomly generated number the key get sad and can be used for future logins the invoice request functionality is a way to provide information to a user about a payment they wish to make in a format that is not an invoice this provides a description of the payment the minimum and maximum amount the service expects to be paid and a url for the wallet from which to request an actual invoice from here the wallet display this information to the user allowing them to set a final amount and request an invoice after sending the invoice request and receiving one back from the serr the wallet rifies that the amount match what the user set and pay the invoice note this feature is already available if you're using phoenix wallet of satoshi or bluewallet muun doe not support it a of now december the withdrawal request work by pinging the service and receiving in response a description a url to send an invoice to a random string and a minimum amount and maximum amount that can be withdrawn after filling in the appropriate value the wallet return an invoice to the serr and if it is valid and within the amount parameter the service pay the invoice the lnurl authenticate protocol can be used in addition to this to ensure that only the intended user can successfully withdraw using the lnurl link common use case would be if you want to withdraw your sat from a lightning service such a the lntipbot here on reddit or the lntot on telegram bolt why do we need it the term bolt is the acronym for b asis o f l ightning t echnology you can compare these to the bips bitcoin improment proposal which are design document for introducing feature or information to bitcoin the bip a amended ha since become the standard way of formally communicating idea about potential bitcoin improments a mentioned at the beginning of this post there are some ux flaw which need to be addressed to understand the problem bolt attempt to sol it is mandatory to ha a look at the current standard which is used to create invoice bolt invoice generated by the bolt standard consist of three main component the destination where the payment is supposed to be sent to public key of the node the amount which is about to be transferred a hash which represents the payment secret the main problem of bolt invoice is that they can only be used once and therefore need to be created in realtime the creation of the invoice lead to the publishing of the payment secret and is therefore unsecure if you would create an invoice with the same secret someone could fraudulently request money due to the fact that the secret is known this make the usage of qr code invoice for ations or other use case impossible what is bolt bolt offer an attempt to achie some of the core functionality that lnurl provides without requiring the use of a web serr an offer encodes the data necessary to reach a node to request an invoice to make a payment either a node id or a blinded path the last few hop in an onion route pre computed and encrypted to that node using onion message it also can encode a minimum amount for a payment the currency being paid in an expiry time and minimum maximum quantity number for purchasing multiple item this is all of the information necessary to fetch an actual invoice from the node that issued the offer someone who want to pay an invoice doe so or onion message one of the core feature of bolt it allows node to make a direct end to end encrypted connection between each other that doe not invol a lightning channel just like lightning payment these can be used to onion route message after obtaining an offer a payer will use the information encoded in it to send an invoice request message the creator of the offer will then respond back with an actual invoice there is also support for generating unique per user offer that allow the receir to request a payment from the creator of the offer similar to lnurl's withdrawal request feature bolt invoice commit to a unique payer key this can be used in the case of issuing refund to pro you are the person who actually paid the invoice this can also be used in combination with the withdrawal offer to guarantee that only the correct person can succeed in getting an invoice paid by the creator a opposed to whoer is able to get a copy of the offer what's best both lnurl and bolt enable a more user friendly way for paying or getting paid on the lightning network while lnurl sits on the application lel bolt provides a solution on proctocol lel where the new offer do neither require a web serr tl certificate nor a domain and provide a higher lel of protection than lnurl using blinded path the bolt offer allow the confidentiality of the node id which additionally enriches the privacy it's important to say both solution can exist simultaneously while online shop and other service provider operate a web serr anyway lnurl is a good add on bolt mostly address the endusers and offer a more connient way to interact with the lightning network

0,bitcoin security budget hi all anyone here is a bit worried about the bitcoin security budget i am a bitcoin lor and i feel like it ha the potential to change the world economy and society anyway recently i heard about the risk that could happen in the future about bitcoin stability it is an issue linked to the miner and their profit right now they get btc per block plus the transaction fee wich is something like btc next halving should not be a problem since it will be btc and so the halving after with a reward of btc miner right now can easily pay off the electricity and hardware to mine bitcoin and they will do it without any problem in the coming year with profit but what about in the next or year you would answer that the price of btc would be so high that en the smallest amount of satoshi could be enough for the miner to do their job but we t know that for sure 't we plus bitcoin is influenced by the nasdaq and sp and by the gornment and central bank decision and ultimately by the world economy and it stability imagine a period of a big recession statistically likely to happen in the next decade what happens if the price of btc drop below the minum price which will make miner stop doing their job since they get le and le btc ery year that minimum price is going to raise i'm sorry for my english i'm italian btw i 't want to fud this thread i just want you to explain to me why i can stay relaxed and keep to stack satoshi

0,impact of more halvings i seem to remember ery halving being approached with some trepidation a to how the miner would adapt historically price go up and more hash power get turned on can this happen another time in my simple understanding each halving will double the cost of production for most commodity the price will reach equilibrium near the cost or production assuming more halvings assuming a current cost of about per btc which i think is a low estimate this put the bitcoin cost of production at x or or t per btc in this seems kind of absurd especially since it assumes the difficulty and hash rate stay constant to what they are today in gin the trajectory of hash rate it should be safe to assume the difficulty will be much higher in than in this would mean the cost of production is en higher than t and the market price would need to be higher than t btc to support this that would put the market cap at m x t or quintillion again an absurd number a this is in t odays dollar inflation would make this en higher another possibility is that the hash rate reach a maximum and then start to drop off if the difficulty is too high miner will ha to drop out of the race and reduce the difficulty and cost to be under the market price this would lead to centralization or at least a reduction in the number of entity controlling the mining hash rate i understand that at some point most of the block reward will be in transaction fee but how doe this impact the orall economics of cost of production the fee are currently running around of the block reward though when the network is busy it ha spiked to from what i can tell the fee will stay relatily the same in absolute btc earned but the coinbase reward get reduced with the halvings this seems like it would put a cap on cost of mining a block thats something like x what it is today so this would put cost of block around m and since that's for btc today that would cap it around m cap to btc more realistic but not sure the math hold up

0,best counterargument available to the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard i'm not sure how exactly i began down this bitcoin austrian economics rabbit hole but about a week ago it led me to two fantastic yet ry distressing book the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard both written by saifedean ammous i'm kind of assuming that these book are well known amongst the bitcoin community i apologize if that's not actually the case the gist is basically fiat money trash bitcoin hard money good although it obviously go into a lot more depth than that frankly i ha felt ry out of my depth reading these book and trying to think about economics this past week or so i am able to read the argument presented and find them compelling and see the logic in them but i am left somewhat frazzled by them like i 't know what to make of them ammous doe a good job of putting thing simply for a bitcoin neophyte like myself but for some reason i still struggle to fully comprehend erything i find nothing wrong with ammous' core argument and honestly i'm kind of alarmed by that is this eryone's response to reading these book what do mainstream economist who read them ha to say about them for me to be like okay he's right and go about my life i ha to think pretty much eryone in gornment is clueless which isn't that crazy i suppose but i still feel a need to seek out some sort of counterargument to these book before i make that conclusion anyways i' been looking with not much success for some sort of response from the mainstream pov to the fiat standard and the bitcoin standard preferably one presenting counterargument to ammous' various point any suggestion

0,the use for bitcoin mining in stabilizing energy market is ry interesting what we are beginning to see with energy production in place like kazakhstan and texas is using bitcoin mining a a sort of financial battery to store the value of produced energy digitally and then to use this value to trade between energy producer based on need this will make energy market more efficient and make energy grid more resilient you can produce at below peak time and then buy at peak time with the bitcoin mined at other time you can produce a sellable asset with waste energy and energy resource to offset the cost of production this is fantastic but a le talked about subsequent effect of this that i possibly naily foresee is the increasing competition for energy by consumer v bitcoin miner often the energy producer themsels a time will come if this continues when an energy producer will ask what's more profitable mining or selling the energy to consumer and when that happens the price of energy will begin to be dictated by the price of bitcoin how much you pay for electricity will be tightly correlated with how much bitcoin can be harsted with that energy and how much in fiat it can be sold for once this happens bitcoin then becomes a sort of de facto reser currency for bitcoin market the price of energy will become volatile a the price of bitcoin and it would make sense then to price energy directly in bitcoin bitcoin will become the unit of account in energy market once this happens i expect bitcoin to grow out of just the energy industry a a unit of account or time and begin to be used a a unit of account for more and more market since energy cost are so fundamental to the cost of most other thing this phenomenon we are seeing now the use of bitcoin mining to extract value from waste energy will directly lead to bitcoin being used a a unit of account worldwide perhaps i'm missing something but i 't think so

0,how to get cryptocurrencies circulating supply from the source hello i wa wondering for a friend how to technically get cryptocurrencies circulating supply for the sake of simplicity for now i narrowed my focus on bitcoin bitcoin forked based altcoin the truth is the cryptocurrency node and it expose the value i'm looking for or the rpc api command gettxoutsetinfo so the probably most nai way would be but perhaps the most reliable to run node of each bitcoin and bitcoin forked based altcoin and later on query each of them you would agree that it's horrible running a bitcoin node is good and good for health though a it cost proper set up deployment maintenance bandwith hosting computing blabla then i remembered ery i think node when initiating use a dns seed gt the primary way to discor peer in the bitcoin network is to connect to a list of btc node that are previously connected hower for the initial connection the node ha to use a publicly known dns feed to retrie a list of ip address of long running stable node so it's available in the code directly and it's easily scalable under master src chainparams cpp then searching for vseeds unfortunately a gettxoutsetinfo is computed by the node with indexed data from the blockchain sync it mean it's also not available from the protocol perspecti of course so having a list of a crypto node appart for a crawling job in my case look like a dead end then i though maybe i can fetch each node address and hope one misconfigured or expose it's node rpc api publicly a it is not standart to ha it enable by default doe not seems realiable but i 't see another way i would be happy to hear any suggestion idea if you ha

0,possibility of 'bad actors' mining btc at a loss i promise this is not fud trying to ha an honest discussion here and i use the term 'bad actors' ry loosely here i just got e watching the latest 'what bitcoin did' podcast and part of it really stuck out in my head why is the btc hash rate at literal all time high when price is so low and miner are reaching a point where they are not profitable there wa mention of 'concern that maybe nation state are starting to turn on machine and mine at whater it cost to get around sanctions' for exle russia mining with their close to free natural gas so i started to think what if this wa to actually happen there wa some incenti either to simply just mine at a loss to get any amount of btc or to possibly attempt to attack the network could be for many reason to flat out mine at a loss this would lead to honest mining company turning off their machine use it wa not profitable to run them different place pay different energy cost so obviously this would impact some country more than others i assume maybe wrongly that the u would be the first to be non profitable should the hash rate continue to climb while btc price continues to fall i know at least i thought a lot of the design of bitcoin is based on game theory that miner will continue to join the network a adoption and price increase what happens to this game theory in this case when a 'bad actor' could possibly ha close to free energy what would happen in this scenario when some entity is mining en if there is no financial incenti to do so would the network difficulty drop enough for 'honest' miner to keep mining to secure the network in this case i assume place like kazakhstan ha ry cheap energy that would allow honest miner there to continue to mine well after place like the u ha turned off their miner how would this realistically play out

0,a question around the future of self custody hey y'all long time lurker around these and other crypto related part of reddit i figured this would be the best community to ask an honest question i ha regarding self custody and it idealized future with the recent collapse of ftx the greater crypto community ha been beating the drum of returning to the fundamental and the importance of not your key not your crypto i wa listening to an interview on the breakdown with jesse powell of kraken this ening and he seemed to imply that the idea of keeping cash in a shoebox under your bed wa some sort of perfect model for how people kept money in the past he wa drawing the comparison to keeping cash under your bed in a shoebox in the old day and it felt like he wa romanticizing it the implication is that keeping your crypto in cold storage on a hardware wallet is what eryone should be doing i do this i' e this since i understood the importance of it when i first got into crypto in early i know i'm a baby i wasn't affected at all by the collapse of ftx en though i'd purchased from them in the past self custody make sense to me it's certainly one of the value i identify with and understand a important to the space simply put we 't want some centralized organization able to freeze our asset control how we spend our money or in anyway affect our decision surrounding it with all that being said here's my question if the idealized future of self custody is realized how doe that look for the normal person and will it er include the same conniences assurance that large centralized bank offer the idea of keeping cash under my bed is frankly ridiculous there's so many thing that can go wrong my house could be broken into and my shoebox taken i could lose the shoebox the shoebox could be taken by a family member if i er want to spend that money i ha to go home and physically get the cash to spend it somewhere the list go on virtually all the same problem exist today with cryptocurrency but to some degree they're en worse want to spend some of my crypto i'd better ha my physical hardware wallet on me or i'd at least better ha transferred some of it to a location that i can access it from the internet what happens if my house burn down maybe i stored my seed phrase in another location but that's kind of a lot to ask isn't it what happens if my hardware wallet malfunction what happens if the company that owns the hardware wallet push a bad firmware software update sure i can always restore that wallet with my seed phrase but holy shit what a painful process not to mention the learning cur on all of it is certainly non trivial i'm a software engineer a lot of the interaction intuitily make some sense to me i won't get too much into how the expectation of asking some non technical year old person is fairly ridiculous i imagine a lot of that will be ironed out or the year a we find a more seamless way to set wallet up and interact with them i want my question to focus around is there a world where self custody is er a connient a trusting some centralized agency with a massi infrastructure and the motivation for people to spend money is connience and to a certain degree security fraud protection insurance etc simply a trade off of having direct control or your money or doe crypto ha some long term solution for that i'm just too close minded to imagine will i always ha to carry my hardware wallet around with me just curious to hear from others thanks

0,can bitcoin fail or face a lot of difficulty if mining difficulty get too high and miner get priced out due to unprofitability or some other cause hi all apology for the long post but i'm just doing some thought experiment and this wa one of them i 't ha enough knowledge about the mining side of btc to go through with this but my question is pretty much the title and i'd like to see what others think and hopefully some reasoning on why this isn't an issue below are some assumption behind the reasoning of this thought i understand the chance are incredibly low for all of these thing happening but i'm still curious to know and i think it would be a good discussion i'm also aware of the difficulty adjustment per point but bear with me so i'm assuming btc price stay low suppressed miner get priced out due to unprofitability a lot and i mean a lot of miner stop mining within a short time horizon to prent further loss i e multiple large mining pool stop mining so much so that there are far too many block until the next difficulty adjustment now there are a fraction of the miner left on the network tasked with solving block but the hash rate ha been reduced heavily resulting in a disproportioned difficulty lel to hash rate block are then sold incredibly slowly and require a heavy amount of energy input and cost to sol still resulting in a potential loss en if we assume miner would recei a higher subsidy said another way i'm assuming that although le miner would be entitled to more of the block reward aka would make it more profitable for them this increase in reward is offset by the large increase in cost to sol the block removing any additional profitability and keeping them in a loss positionthis then lead me to a few question what the title is asking is the mining difficulty adjustment calculation weighted more towards the near term and would it help sol this issue after slowly solving the remaining block well abo the desired arage minute blocktime i'd appreciate any good resource on learning about the difficulty adjustment can something like this be mitigated is it crucially important for the arage block to be sold ery minute what happens if me one block per hour or worse than that i would think this is important a it help preser the security of the network and to keep the cost to attack the network high via double spending or making a longer manipulated chainthat's the extent of my thought and question i'm no expert probably clear to some of you haha but wanted to ask anyway thanks

0,with time most online merchant are realizing the benefit of accepting bitcoin in their online store and dumping other altcoins a online merchant experiment with crypto and start accepting crypto payment they are often intrigued by the idea of accepting multiple cryptocurrencies but a time go by most of them often realize that there is really no real benefit of doing so and the best crypto to accept is bitcoin it is the only crypto that ha the most user base and the only one that is still standing today and will in the future en many crypto payment gateway for some reason also think it's lucrati to offer crypto option for their user but it's actually disadvantageous for online merchant who start accepting shitcoins on their webstores only to see their value drop or go to zero suddenly in the long run the safest bet is bitcoin whener people ask me what's the best route to start accepting crypto my advice is always to start with bitcoin and take it from there and use gateway that are noncustodial and 't ask for kyc if privacy is a concern there are many payment gateway that make it simple for online merchant to start accepting bitcoin on their online store and 't ask for id doc such a blockonomics gourl and btcpay serr starting simple is always the best way and experimenting with too many altcoins especially without prior knowledge is risky

0,i'm from the future here's what ftx actually wa and what happened you may not see it now but sbf actually showed eryone what ftx wa setup to do those invold felt ok doing it right out in the open use it's hard to imagine anyone would suspect what i am about to tell you if ftx wa still operating to this day ftx wa setup from the beginning a a dark money political slush fund this scheme always had an exit strategy but it wa supposed to be year if not decade down the road before they would need to exit they knew there wa always a chance someone would start to figure out what wa going on but no one suspected this they were going to use ftx to fund erything they could to permanently take control of the u gornment or the next year think of the midterm a a trial run of this setup at sbf funneled million into the midterm making him the second largest democrat ator behind george soros it's ry likely that m wa ftxs customer fund or laundered money but it s safe to say at the ry least it wa not sbfs money the reason it seems like eryone is caught with pant down hoping if they hold still no one will notice is use they honestly t know what to do they are exposed so badly that for now the safest thing to do is nothing sam knew from the beginning it wa all fake and no matter how much success or fame he gained from ftx that his fate would ultimately end with the ents we saw the other day i can only speculate on this part but i think a time went on he really belied that if it weren t for those who orchestrated erything that he would be a successful ceo of an exchange like ftx or time he started to belie his action were why ftx wa at the top of the world and he resented the fact he would ner get credit for it resentment grew and he accelerated the process by taking action he wasn t supposed to which led to the end of ftx to be clear i am saying the democrat and other powerful political entity set up ftx with the intention of using it to fund whater they needed to expand their reach and stay in power they were going to continue operating a long a possible and they had a plan b that they saw a a win win the exit strategy all along wa to blow up ftx in such a fashion that the sec would ha what it needed to force regulation of the crypto space it would also help cor their track of their political operation the large medium company were also invold in running cor for this operation i m not sure how much they knew about what wa really going on but i suspect they didn t know much they ha operated essentially a a wing of the democrat party for year now and are likely comfortable doing this sort of thing without knowing why this is likely why they weren t worried about orselling smb and ftx to an absurd degree they likely wouldn t ha been so obvious about it if they known what they were invold in coring up gt please note that some of the packaging includes part small enough to be a choking hazard to anybody under the age of the first step in the assembly process is setting the cartridge labelled 'izyalikeit' to at least a value of centi mark

0,i heard not your key not your coin on this sub hundred of time ner really understood the real meaning though i admittedly trusted coinbase with my coin up until last week the reason wa my interpretation to not your key not your coin meant to me that coinbase could block my account and deny me from reaching my coin and personally the risk of having my coin on me wa higher than on coinbase so i left them there what i recently learned that this term wa not explained well enough to me to understand what exchange were doing and if i did i would ha weighed the risk much differently apparently exchange were playing the old bank game of selling iou when they t en ha the coin not that my coin are with them and i might be blocked no there wa no coin to begin with they were basically printing bitcoins that wa a sudden realization to me i didn t know i wa buying iou i thought i wa buying bitcoin me not pulling my coin after buying them only helped them play this game en more and i wa part of the problem just a they now i m thinking how did selling iou effected the real price value of bitcoin if they were still are printing bitcoin they must ha affected the price greatly i now also understand the need for regulation it s more about regulating this aspect more than any thing else unfortunately most of the regulation we ha now is on the buyer side with id rification and tax we need regulation on exchange to ensure they are selling something they actually own i want to add one small detail coinbase might technically be in a better position than other privately owned exchange but still i wouldn t make the same mistake en with them ry disappointed of my self that it took me this much time to understand hope this help someone better understand this current situation

0,ftx' and it's token once again btc is not crypto ftx and it shit coin debacle wa called by mallardshead month ago bitcoin is not crypto bitcoin is the breakthrough crypto token alt all that are only possible use bitcoin showed it wa possible bitcoin is a network a protocol and a system of digital money that made one of the biggest breakthrough in history the inntion of digital scarcity it allowed a digital thing to be tied to the real world through quantifiable expenditure of energy pow bitcoin is a public utility that ha no owner no ruler no backing of any state or corporation and a conception that can ner again be repeated in history cryptos are project that tackle use case raise funding ha employee ceo's board member foundation and can easily be censored by a state of crypto is created to enrich the creator with retail a exit liquidity all of them will trend to zero against bitcoin bitcoin is an alternati to central banking modern monetary policy run by volunteer and can be used by anyone and eryone it doe not discriminate it is a public good like the internet is for moving and storing information the bitcoin network is for moving and storing value crypto is not much different from fintech company except they use a slow and expensi database and print their own treasury at the push of a button sure there might be some interesting use case but literally all of them can be e without a blockchain understanding that bitcoin is not crypto is just the first step the deeper you go into that rabbit hole the more question you ask the more you put bitcoin under a microscope the more mind blowing it becomes bitcoin is not crypto i see bitcoin the internet remote work and proliferation of english the language composing to distribute away the power center of nation state bank and corporation not sometime in the distant future either rather around the end of this decade we'll see the eu alliance break dao's form in smaller african nation and palestine's import match their export it will become a real challenge for gornment's to levy tax i think we're starting to see this begin already that mean en more aggressi money printing and the militarization of tax agency it won't work though gornments will ha to incentivize their own citizen to pay tax and this will require project of immense value with transparent accounting the prestige politician ha enjoyed for so long will fade a their power get distributed to the people and real solution without symbolic affectation are required to gorn when the lightning network is ready node liquidity and user growth is currently parabolic maybe by bitcoin will enter it transaction phase whole coin won't be so much a thing a satoshis or sat the law of diminishing return will ha arrid gone will be the day of x gain and large volatility the gain will become smaller and slower i expect this to begin at sat which would correlate to a m bitcoin which would gi the network the entire market cap of gold currently t still small and we'll still see large gain until m but they'll be smaller and the dollar peg will fade a robust defi ecosystem will also be built on and around bitcoin that mean smart contract the taproot upgrade will kick this off in earnest which will only augment network effect and utility bitcoin adoption is growing at a faster global pace than the internet did in the s one reason for this is use the infrastructure is already built when open source satellite blanket the world allowing a transaction in patagonia or the arctic a easily a nyc gornment's can do what elon musk suggested they do when he wa asked about regulation of starlink or afghanistan they can shake their fist at the sky i posit bitcoin will be man's final money just a artificial intelligence ai will be man's final inntion this is mostly due to the way bitcoin lerages energy a henry ford and thomas edison crudely figured out year ago in what most fail to realize is that the only physical currency in the world is energy see energy is required to ha a standing military to start a small business for nation state to exist for transportation globalization and maybe most importantly to communicate bitcoin then us energy to guarantee an individual's property btc and secure it network this is much different than the approach po consensus blockchains take their gornance is a conrsation eryone want to side step and pivot towards the other two part of the blockchain trilemma they' sold money ha nothing to do with tps throughput or tx cost those are all feature of a blockchain many of u grew up under democracy and assume it angelic ideal are best applied erywhere well they're not especially on blockchains aspiring for global adoption the first problem is there's no way to know how many people own how many token which make the allocation of voting power impossible and unfair another problem is there's no way to curtail collusion another is that of the world's population li in two country china india and that percentage is only growing another is that voting is a skill and after something is voted on and passed token holder against the change s ha no ability to opt out we won't en bother going into the tokenomics many of these project boast bitcoin doe away with this nonsense by guaranteeing immutable right having fixed issuance and tethering itself to the physical world by leraging physical infrastructure none more important than energy whether you ha bitcoin or satoshis doesn't matter there's nothing one can do that the other cannot there's no voting no securing the network with staking no special privilege no collusion and on the consensus layer if a proposal is agreed upon by of the hash it's optional wether a miner want to implement it or not meaning they can opt out bitcoin's first attraction is greed but below it quietly disburses freedom and distributes away the center of power structure bitcoin pollutes the environment from an economy of scale cheap electricity access to capital but below it quietly incentivizes green energy making it competiti regardless of fossil fuel affordability the end result of this trojan horse is going to be fascinating to watch and how fast it degrades nation state or finance sci fi alternati energy project might surprise some my judgement a warning and if you 't mind a tinfoil hat all of this doesn't happen without manifesting ry real problem during it transition phase but whater you're doing in life currently it should be geared towards acquiring more bitcoin i'd en suggest temporarily taking on a second job for the task now for the tinfoil hat a friction technical difficulty of wallet and hard wallet collapse privacy and ui improments will skyrocket this mean the first thing to break will be world gornment's ability to levy tax effectily which will require an enormous increase in money printing and the militarization of their tax collection agency the second shoe to drop will be mass municipal bankruptcy a city are already crushed under the weight of pension debt which they carry in hope of getting federal bailouts use this debt is unserviceable and staring down the barrel of compound interest with pension gone fireman police your water teacher park and recreation will become unstable climate change how will city finance the infrastructure needed to combat worsening drought fire and flooding much of the entire state of florida for exle flattest u state ha serious flooding issue nobody want to talk about the entire lower half of the state's coastline need project

0,common bitcoin fallacy bitcoin doe not ha any utility bitcoin is money and money doe not ha many us other than being money it's a worthless paper without any other utility or an entry in a database that being said money is one of the most important inntions we er made and modern civilization could not exist without it money is only useful for financial us that mean it is either a medium of exchange a store of value of an unit of account it's boring but ry important money is a gt trillion market and bitcoin can fill some niche within this market and capture a smaller or bigger percentage of it whether people use it a digital modern rsion of gold a a decentralized saving account remittance a an alternati to banking where banking is not available protect themsels against hyperinflation of their local currency or against corrupt regime or just add it to their instment portfolio to dirsify all of these are legitimate us of bitcoin for which there will always be a certain demand bitcoin is a zero sum game therefore it can't be an instment a lot of thing people inst in are zero sum instments gold art wine currency commodity derivatis option future are all exles of zero sum instments some of which ha existed for hundred or thousand of year bitcoin doe not ha an intrinsic value therefore the market value is zero a lot of thing that people inst in 't ha an intrinsic value gold art collectible and fiat currency 't ha any intrinsic value and yet they ha a constant value abo zero bitcoin consumes a much energy a an entire country this argument is often used by journalist trying to manipulate their reader why use country but not compare them to the energy consumption of other thing video gaming and tumble dryer consume a much energy a bitcoin but no one perceis them a energy wasting country is used use people percei country a huge but they percei gaming or dryer a small and insignificant source of energy consumption in reality bitcoin us only of global energy worldwide a fairly insignificant number cattle farming is estimated to generate of global greenhouse emission x more than bitcoin and yet some people seem to be feel far more threatened by bitcoiners instead of meat eater bitcoin can't scale this doe also imply that use bitcoin can't scale now it ner will the truth is that while the base layer ha a limited tps capacity bitcoin doesn't need to perform all it's transaction on the first layer so claiming that bitcoin a a technology can ner scale would also assume that no building on second layer will er happen which is of course contradicted by the fact that effort are being made build on second layer a demand for transaction go up there is an incenti to build more capacity on other layer of the network bitcoin is too volatile this doe also imply use bitcoin is volatile now it will always be that volatile there is no reason to belie volatility in bitcoin is constant volatility is a reflection of market maturity bitcoin wa far more volatile than bitcoin and that trend to lower volatility will continue recently bitcoin wa le volatile than the dow jones or nasdaq

0,problem with a bitcoin monetary standard i ha been a bitcoiner for a few year now i am currently in an advanced keynesian macroeconomics class and it ha made me question some thing if there is a bitcoin monetary standard in the future how will business get credit loan to operate their business without credit business would innovate much much slower productivity would go way down le employee they can hire etc it would be much harder to get a business off the ground and take so much longer to build up a business than if you had cheap credit i understand the consequence of cheap credit hence there must be bitcoin bank or exchange that distribute value between sars and borrower since bitcoin is decentralized and no protection from a central bank i can imagine there would be bank run all the time the loan to borrower would be ry illiquid and the liability of sars who deposited their bitcoin would be ry liquid this is what happened during the great depression hypothetically all the bitcoin depositor would pull out of the exchange and the exchange would become insolnt therefore lending credit would be pretty much non existent in a bitcoin standard therefore output and productivity would greatly go down therefore standard of living go down can someone please walk me through this and pro me wrong the keynesian are getting to me

1,are l rollups really the panacea for scaling i'm trying to get a better understanding of the roadmap use i 't understand how rollups are really going to work for real world high volume usage let me clarify that real world cheap secure and connient usage each l is like a silo in more accurate language it ha no asynchronous composability with the l or other l if a dapp is on l a and your fund are on l b you ha no access to the dapp you can go to l and back to l a but are people really going to do that cost and inconnience other solution i'm reading about are inter rollup bridge or intermediary en if these are fully secure and invisible to the user will they really be then you still face two possible problem routingcostthe issue being unless ery l is direct bridged to ery other l you might need multiple hop to get from rollups b to a the routing problem is well known with no centralised party managing route discory how is the optimal route discored cost is that ery bridge intermediary ha to be created liquidity maintained and that ain't for free connecting all l to all others seems ry inefficient and in itself creates another layer of cost complexity similarly publishing ery dapp on l and all l seems ry expensi and fragment liquidity i belie a core innovation of cryptocurrency is dis intermediation the removal of intermediary that's what make it pp hopefully these issue are thought through and someone can link to a clearer definition of how rollups scaling is expected to interoperate at mass scale tia
1,how big a role will the digital world play a the real world recors i think that en though the future of the economy remains uncertain that shouldn't scare off artist from experimenting and branching out it's exactly this type of approach that will make an artist more likely to succeed in unstable time not le i looked for the number and statistic which are not that great the brookings institution estimated that the creati industry wa on track to suffer a loss in sale of or billion in the united state alone with the performing and fine art sector being hit the hardest many more began to explore in earnest the opportunity waiting for them in the online space web publishing and streaming a well a emerging technology such a nfts and the metarse provided way for artist to expand their reach and experiment with new form i had that feeling that it en seemed like some artist were ready to turn their back on the real world altogether and embrace nfts a their new future what do you think the near future could look like for artist and other creatis i think that nfts will still likely be a focal point just take a look at project such a reelstar not only do nfts help artist dirsify their sale channel and reach a much broader more tech savvy audience but the blockchain technology undergirding nfts also make it extremely easy for artist to track resale and collect royalty automatically i en think that more artist will explore the metarse for artist who want to make their future a little more stable insting in a dirse array of channel and project could be crucial how big a role will the digital world play a the real world recors what do you think should we rely on digital asset

1,most people t understand the absolutely massi amount of computational power needed if they really wanted a gamefi project that actually entertaining eryone agrees that the main issue with gamefi is the fact that game are mediocre and mechanic are ry simple and while that s true the main reason behind it is the fact that an actually entertaining ethereum based game need a whole lot of computing power and blockchains in general especially ethereum are known to sweat when it come to mass production of nfts regardless of whether you think nft game actually make sense or not if it were for the scalability issue that come along with this concept we would ha already had some relatily entertaining game at least compared to the one we ha right now i m pretty sure a ethereum keep introducing update though we ll start seeing an improment in that regard some gaming centered ethereum rollups are starting to pop up like the mantle network they ll be helping to impro upon community lead gaming which in my opinion is the selling point behind gamefi when compared to regular gaming since the community get to be in full control i also remember seeing ubisoft help launch a gaming l called myria back in august but han t seen any update on it since for some people gamfi make no sense and i get where they re coming from considering that conntional gaming is just fine but i d personally like to see where community lead gaming would lead u we still ner had a popularized game where ery single decision is made by the community it would be rather interesting to see especially considering that vitalik s work on ethereum wa inspired by a centralized decision made in a game

1,here s why vitalik s trimella is becoming le and le of an issue for ethereum the trilemma ha haunt ery single blockchain there is no matter what anyone say there is not a single chain that ha yet to sol the trilemma at least for now each chain deal with the trilemma in it own way and ethereum chose to prioritize decentralization and security or scalability now although there technically still is no complete solution for vitalik s trilemma there ha been many improments to both the ethereum chain itself and it helping rollup chain known a l that wont sol the trilemma but will make it le and le of an issue with time until it entually no longer become a nuance there are mainly two reason why the trilemma on ethereum will grow irrelevant pretty soon modular l parallel l mantle network proto danksharding modular l current l while much more efficient than ethereum still ha a hard time dealing with massi spike in activity use they use a monolithic architecture arbitrum optimism loopring what doe this mean this mean that these l while fast still need to take care of execution finality and data availability in a serial manner meaning one after the other modular l take a different approach they basically split these taks into multiple sub layer and work all of them at the same time in parallel rather than in series currently i know of mantle network a the only l with a modular l testnet online they split task into three separate layer layer take care of execution layer take care of finality layer take care of data availability the final layer is perhaps the most important of all a data availability is one of the major issue that ethereum ha it battle with it make the chain extremely clunky and orloads it with data most of which will ner be used proto danksharding i been on this subreddit long enough and ha seen many post explaining what sharding is so i won t make this post any longer to make it short shadring is an ethereum upgrade that will gi a majoe boost for l throughput is expected to increase anywhere from to time combination of modular architecture and danksharding modular l alone are great sharding alone is greatbut the combination of both is something else entirely this will gi ethereum compounded scalability something that it ha ner seen before i truly belie that when danksharding get introduced and more l start leaning towards a modular architecture ethereum will be truly unstoppable and vitalik s trilemma while still technology unsold will become irrelevant

1,what are the main problem pe game need to sol to become mainstream although i ha high hope for blockchain gaming there are certain evident problem that might limit widespread adoption and gi the pe nft gaming industry more negati publicity i would add to the list some of these issue most people say that nft game are not fun i wa one of them until i started checking out coinfantasy or god unchained it's true that there ha been a ton of game token and release in the nft space recently and many of them look like garbage with ry questionable gameplay it becomes tough to keep gamers engaged when the gameplay is extremely repetiti and there are le than minute of it people just stop playing the game when they stop making money orall the majority of current pe game feel more like a job with the worst kind of grind would you agree how about a high entry barrier the majority of casual player simply cannot pay the admission cost it cause two related problem first the game is inaccessible to regular user which hinders long term user growth second instors are typically trader rather than gamers the delopers recei little input when the instors 't actually play the game and the game gradually dy poor tokenomics is probably one of the common issue trader buy nfts and hire gamers scholar to play the game using these nfts scholar make money in the form of nati crypto token instors and gamers dump the token on new instors hower once new instors stop to join the game there is no exit liquidity for current instors we all know that traditional gamers hate nfts but i belie that one of the problem is that instors ha unrealistic expectation despite the fact that there are many problem with this sort of gaming in general i belie that we should gi it a try use there are many fantastic game what do you think about all of the problem i' mentioned will they soon be resold that in my opinion is the crucial element that will allow game to advance en further
1,how to track for certain all address affected by a transaction and from this i understand that a transaction between eoaa and a smart contract can trigger transfer of token from the eoaa that sent the transaction to another eoab but this transfer of token between eoaa to eoab is not recorded on the blockchain my question now is if one is interested in tracking and be alerted by all activity on an account how will one do this for exle if i want to be notified when token are transfered to eoab gin the fact that the token transfer from eoaa to eoab doe not show up in any transaction how can i be notified based on my knowledge one way could be to listen to transfer ents on smart contract but follow up question a far a i understand it is possible for a smart contract to implement the transfer method without emitting the transfer ent not good practice but nothing stopping this from happening which make me think this approach of listening to the transfer ent might not be fool proof the transfer method and transfer ents are standardized part of erc token but i can imagine that there are other method and operation peculiar to certain smart contract not standardized but that will also lead to token transfer from one eoa to another so that mean an approach of listening to just the transfer ent will miss these kind of token moment so again the question how can one track all ents' especially token and eth transfer in and out of an eoa gin the technical drawback i listed below are there some knowledge about the working of ethereum that i do not know about that could make this possible

1,could a bunch of people in a room set up a manual blockchain or other dlt i wa wondering about this to get a clearer idea of how the idea behind blockchains could be applied in different con so imagine there are a hundred people in a room each person ha some money stashed at home and some good to sell is it possible for them to set up an analog manual blockchain or other distributed ledger system without using an actual blockchain what is the least amount of technology they could use whether they need to use messaging or pen and paper or a whiteboard doe each pair of trader need a witness three witness if this ha already been explored feel free to link some resource thanks
1,interest bearing dollar on chain question about adoption one great thing about leaving your money in a bank is that you get interest usdc doe not bear interest and eth and other cryptos are risky normal people may not always want to be insted into risky asset so it seems like they can hold dollar on chain which no risk like they can in the real world the difference is a few percent each year currently i can deposit money in bank who can buy bond and gi me interest most of the time this can equalise inflation admittedly not in if people ha their money in defi then they arent making money some exles binance hold bn in stable coin which lose value or time robinhood ha x dollar in a bank which gain value john sell ether and doesnt want to offr capital gain fee etc it a bear market so he scared to buy so he lea his money in usdc which losesvalue mary sell aapl and lea her money in a bank during a bear market which still yield in year people want to be able to accept payment whater on the blockchain use new smart contract come out that are more efficient cheaper faster they ha no interest in insting it into risky asset due to lack of time and expertise they lea their money in usdc it loses value my sandwich man downt the road accepts my payment it go to his bank account he make yield my grandparent want to ha their saving account on the blockchain except thats a stupid idea use it make interest hence bank which make which is enough for him to li off of with mn in his account hence we need bank at some profound lel you get the idea is this is a barrier to adoption what are the solution to this

1,so many different crypto why remod view poll s
1,crypto tax are eth gas fee taxable here we get query on this subject all the time so i thought i'd clear the air when you dispose of cryptocurrency to pay for a fee you may trigger a capital gain tax cgt ent on the disposal value of the fee itself depending on your tax jurisdiction of course a a result this capital gain loss is realised on the difference between the acquisition and disposal price of the cryptocurrency before paying for the fee a an exle you purchase eth to use for fee at the price of some time later you decide to mint an nft the gas fee for this mint are paid for in eth and you pay a gas fee of eth at the time of the sale the price of eth is now a a result you' actually made a gain on the eth itself which wa used a a gas fee the reason why is use the acquisition value of the eth wa and the disposal value of the eth is therefore this will trigger a capital gain ent of for the sale of the eth which wa used for gas while this may seem obvious to some you'd be surprised how many people forget to account for this in their capital gain calculation hope that clarifies thing and feel free to read more on this here

1,the truth about cbdcs design choice by ecb fed analysed both are aiming at tight control or account interest and spending a digital prison is being built in the shadow due diligence the truth about cbdcs ominous design realed a digital prison is being built in the shadow massi orreach of central bank underway they are designing a new kind of money allowing them to establish centralized settlement of all payment tie digital identity to all transaction and record them on a central bank ledger forer force built in feature such a limit on how much cbdc you can ha in your account negati interest rate account charge in line with regulatory objectis and cap on conrsions and spending create money that is traceable programmable taxable and subject to the monetary whim of central planner st out spending without permission and slowly phase out cash the war on money continues the aim to replace cash with a system of centralized control or all transaction and account balance this report explains exactly what to expect from central bank digital currency cbdcs it look at the possible design option what central bank ha decided so far and the likely outcome the ugly conclusion is that cbdcs are a new form of currency that allows a small group of unelected people control or what we can and cannot do with our own money lt what is going on a lot ha been said and written about cbdcs most wa speculation but now evidence emerges of what is being built gin that our financial system is complex one cannot just click a button and introduce a cbdc a of now much work ha already been e and much is still to be e this report trace the historical path of the delopment of cbdcs we start with looking at what cbdcs are then we look at why we need them a explained by the bank of international settlement bi next we look at how cbdcs are designed a the central regulator of central bank the bi made an inntory of all the different design option for cbdcs it also provided an honest account of the potential benefit and downside of those choice with this knowledge we can analyze the design choice made so far we obser how the european central bank ecb is going full steam ahead with their cbdc we come to the shocking discory that the most important design choice ha already been made and that there ha en been company hired to start programming next we analyze what is happening in the u the u federal reser fed is not a far advanced with their cbdc a the ecb hower their frank report real that their cbdc design choice result in similar control mechanism a that of the ecb and it en expose possible sinister motis to put it bluntly what central bank are choosing for design so far tell u all we need to know about where this is heading authority are downplaying what is going on and pretending that all is open for debate and subjected to the democratic process but the design they are secretly pushing forward open the door to the dystopian future we all fear lt what are central bank digital currency before we can continue we ha to define cbdcs after all we already ha digital money but cbdcs and what we currently use a digital money are ry different thing what we currently refer to a digital money is not issued by the central bank in the modern financial system the central bank only creates money in the form of cash bill and coin and cash deposit with bank all other money is created by private bank that s right the digital money currently in use is created by private institution the digital unit in your bank account are issued by a private bank cbdcs on the contrary are digital public money issued by the central bank cbdcs are a totally new kind of money with many new feature to summarize we go from two type to three type of retail money cash public money current digital money private money current cbdc public money new source ecb digital euro our future money note that cbdcs are essentially just different form of the same currency one unit of cash is on par with one unit of cbdc they are interchangeable for reason explained later these form of money are also intended to exist alongside each other for the foreseeable future to summarize central bank are issuing a new rsion of money which is a liability of the central bank a such cbdcs are not just another form of digital money a public money they are more comparable to the other form of public money cash this begs the question why do we need an addition replacement for cash lt why do we need cbdcs according to central bank there is much debate on why cbdcs are being rolled out to avoid speculation we will stick with what the bi ha said about why we need cbdcs this approach help u to understand the decision central bank ha taken and what the logical outcome will be financial stability and the reduced role of public moneyor the past few year cash ha become le popular this present a problem use a shown cash is currently the only form of public money used by the public retail and so when cash is phased out so is public money a principal concern of central bank is that if in the future cash were no longer widely accepted or available a sere financial crisis in the private financial system might create further havoc by disrupting day to day business and retail transaction cbdcs would be a way to keep the economy functioning monetary policyanother benefit of cbdcs touted by the bi is that they allow for a more direct influence on monetary policy argument for issuing a cbdc include potential strengthening of the pas through of the policy rate to money market and deposit rate and helping to alleviate the zero or effecti lower bound constraint the bi also argues for direct stimulus let s take a look at each benefit strengthening of the pas through of the policy rate mean more control or the interest rate charged throughout the financial system central bank wish to bypass private bank and set rate directly from the moment that household consider a cbdc to be an alternati to commercial bank deposit bank will ha le scope for independently setting the interest rate on deposit of the general public the zero lower bound describes the limit of negati interest rate in short in an environment of increasingly lower interest rate on bank account people might pull their money out of the bank it is after all better to hold cash than money in an account that charge deep negati interest rate to address this issue the imf circulated a paper called breaking through the zero lower bound it explores the idea of having different interest rate for different form of money for exle an additional interest rate on cash can ry easily be charged on private bank through what is known a the cash window at the central bank the central bank charge the regular bank for the use of cash and the bank then charge the user through extra fee on withdrawal and deposit this way the use of cash can be made more expensi than digital form of money this mechanism can be applied to steer the use of different form of money and en be a stepping stone on the road to a cashless society a you ll see later the imf s idea of different interest rate for different kind of money is vigorously embraced by central bank for exle the nigerian central bank used this idea to restrict cash shortly after introducing their unpopular cbdc and finally according to the bi cbdcs could facilitate a more direct distribution of fiscal stimulus to those member of the general public who need it this could make such policy more effecti than general helicopter money or distribution through the indirect and imperfect banking channel which ha been used in the past financial inclusionanother buzzword central bank like to use is financial inclusion with a cbdc eryone could ha access to basic financial service this would be especially interesting for people not serd by the current financial system which is a situation more prevalent outside the deloped world but a always like much else in the dirsity and inclusion agenda these rosy goal are mostly a facade one of the most prominent organisation behind financial inclusion is the united nation for whom the financial inclusion agenda allows the unlocking of public and private resource to fund their sustainable delopment goal the un in turn coordinate it policy through the better than cash alliance an ngo acting a a front for the interest of among others the bill melinda gate foundation citi bank mastercard and visa inc in this light inclusi finance can be seen a the conrsion of the unbanked into tax and debt serf who pay transaction fee and ser a collateral for the financial system financial innovationthe bi is discussing all sort of other feature all made possible by the idea of programmable money a we will see most of this innovation is in the interest of central bank one of the promised benefit of cbdcs is that it can make international payment much more efficient and transparent use these kind of liability are being built from scratch cbdcs are billed a offering a unique opportunity to facilitate easier cross border payment lt cbdc design choicesbefore we continue it is important to note that there ha been few official decision made a to how to mo forward the introduction of a cbdc requires significant work and central bank are moving slowly in order not to break anything in this next section we look at the orviews the bi ha made on designing cbdcs lot of research ha been e across academia financial institution and the central bank and the bi ha created a nice summary of the design option it also real what the benefit and downside of these design choice are with this knowledge we can then look at the design decision that ha already been made by the ecb and fed and hence conclude what is happening behind the scene token v identity basedfirst of all a choice ha to be made a to whether the cbdc is to be token based or tied to an identity through an account according to the bi it ha to be either one or the other source bi quarterly review march a token based system would work like other crypto currency those with the private key can spend the money but the drawback according to the bi are sere one is the high risk of losing fund if end user fail to keep their private key secret furthermore it would be challenging to design an effecti regulatory framework for such a system law enforcement agency would run into difficulty when seeking to identify claim owner or follow money flow just a with cash or bearer security in addition a token system would nullify the central bank objectis discussed abo the other option is that the use and ownership of a cbdc is accessible through an account tied to an identity similar to how the current banking system operates to make this happen the bi call for strong identity for all account holder where each individual is tied to one identifier across the entire payment system the disadvantage of an account based system according to a paper of the bi are that you cannot ha anonymity vi a vi the central bank and there cannot be private peer to peer transaction without an intermediary a is currently possible with cash see graph source bi committee on payment and market infrastructure cbdcs direct or indirect liability the next question should people ha an account directly with the central bank or through intermediary financial institution here the consideration are not just about what is desirable but also what is practically feasible currently central bank simply do not ha the infrastructure to hold account for hundred of million of citizen in addition there are regulatory obligation such a kyc and customer due diligence that central bank do not ha the infrastructure and mandate for the most logical outcome would be for central bank to use the existing financial company to roll out cbdcs on a more technical lel the question then becomes is the cbdc to be a liability on the balance sheet of the central bank or on the balance sheet of a financial intermediary with the latter option the cbdc would be an indirect liability of the central bank also known a a synthetic cbdc the bi doe not like this idea centralized v decentralizedanother choice need to be made between using a decentralized settlement system or a centralized one firstly for regulator decentralized doe not mean the same thing a it doe to the industry they see it a a few regulated entity validating the settlement system moreor regular consensus mechanism ha too much orhead and are too slow for the large number of transaction needed an issue the bi ha with a decentralized cbdc is that it mean that a decentralized network make adjustment to the balance sheet of the central bank this increase the risk to the system according to the bi programmabilityone of the main question a central bank ha to ask itself is whether it is going to create programmable money what is programmable money the u federal reser provides a good definition a digital form of money and a mechanism for specifying the automated behavior of that money through a computer program this mechanism is termed programmability in this note across the pond in individual country within the eu the need for programmable money is being debated hower a you will see in the following section programmability is an essential part of cbdcs the ecb ha en already released an api for institution to start programming financial stability requirementsthe fact that cbdcs are going to be exchangeable for digital currency result in some major risk to the financial system after all cbdcs make it easy to pull your money out of a private institution risk and deposit it with the central bank no risk if cbdcs could be freely traded the moment rumor spread that a bank is having issue all account holder will conrt their account balance to cbdcs guaranteed by the central bank you could ha instant bank run and collapse in the financial system would happen a quickly a they do in the crypto space in addition adding cbdcs increase the total amount of money in circulation creates en more inflation at a time when people are already having problem paying their bill a a result any cbdc need a built in mechanism to limit the amount of total cbdc that can be issued and limit how much can be exchanged for digital currency in short a programmable aspect of the cbdc ha to come into play we will see later how both the ecb and fed are already committed to using financial stability a an excuse to take full control or how cbdcs can be held charged and exchanged monetary policyone of the main activity of central bank or the last decade ha been trying to manage the economy through monetary policy up until now these interntions ha not always been effecti in kick starting the economy cbdcs can gi the central bank when properly designed much more direct tool for implementing monetary policy privacyprivacy is one of the main concern of regulator or at least it is the main concern for their potential user so this issue ha to be addressed in the design of the coin it is worth noting that privacy mean something different for central banker and for end user in the crypto space it mean that the technology make it impossible for anyone to track your purchase from the point of view of central bank privacy mean that the organisation monitoring and facilitating your payment are under constraint a to what they can and ha to do with your data moreor central bank compare the privacy of cbdcs with data mining private financial service company and with transaction being e on public blockchains they argue that in that light public institution are better at safeguarding privacy for the design of a cbdc a central bank ha to make a decision a to what lel of privacy a coin will ha taking into account that full privacy is considered incompatible with other policy objectis such a kyc and aml compliance a we will see there are strong indication that privacy a it is understood by the crypto industry is not going to be built into the cbdc system interoperabilitycentral bank will ha to make certain design choice such a whether foreigner are to be able to hold account with the central bank or if there is to be some sort of exchange facility perhaps similar to what the crypto industry call an atomic swap a coordinated cbdc design effort could take a clean slate perspecti and incorporate cross border payment option right from the start private v public chainon a final note instors in existing blockchains such a xlm or xrp ha been publicly claiming that cbdcs will be built with their chain a the base layer this is simply not going to happen a previously mentioned cbdcs are liability on the balance sheet of the central bank there is no way that they are going to base this on an existing blockchain use it would mean they would ha to take full control or the network now that we understand the different design choice available we can look behind the scene at how central bank are applying them starting with the ecb lt the digital euro ecb design choicesto understand the process of the creation of the digital euro we ha to recap how the eu work this is well described by todd huizinga a former american diplomat to the eu he explains in detail that the eu is run by elite who wish to create an er closer union regardless of the desire of the population of individual eu country a a result the eu ha created a culture where policy are presented a still being debated and subject to democratic principle whilst in fact behind closed door the direction is being agreed upon in backroom deal the same seems to apply to the eu s cbdc the digital euro the design and building of the digital euro is at an advanced stage while officially nothing ha been decided the reality hower is that the issuing of the euro and logically also the design of the digital euro is delegated to the european central banking system and a you will see in the remainder of this section the digital euro train left the station a long time ago with funding already secured and company being hired to build the required infrastructure a it stand now legislation is to be finalized in q and only in q will the decision on the digital euro be formally approd note that by then the design will be finished the design choice of the digital euroin the ecb published their report on the digital euro it see the future euro a a safe digital asset with advanced functionality and with profound implication for key area of central banking for the broader economic and financial system and ultimately for the life of european citizen the digital euro would be first of all another way to supply euro conrtible at par with other form of the euro a digital euro will be a liability of the eurosystem and therefore by definition risk free central bank money programmabilitythe digital euro should keep pace with state of the art technology at all time in order to best address the need of the market among required attribute are usability connience speed cost efficiency and programmability it should be made available through front end solution throughout the entire euro area and should be inter operable with private payment solution programmability is going to be required for a number of desired feature there are going to be control on how much money can be exchanged between different form of the euro different interest rate on different form of the euro and limit on what one can hold and or transact in crisis situation there will likely be a maximum amount of cbdc which can be held by one person at no additional cost in term of monetary policy the digital euro should be remunerated at interest rate s that the central bank can modify or time and with different interest rate applied in different case to get an idea of how much digital euro each account owner is allowed to own before being faced with restricti measure such a negati interest rate the dutch central bank suggests that euro should be enough for most dutch citizen a it represents one month s living expense and a financial buffer for unforeseen expense next to the account feature there is work being e on special payment instruction such a payment e between machine in short the digital euro is going to be programmable and not in a way that impros financial freedom account based access and the digital identitythe bi report taught u that central bank can issue a token or an account based system the ecb indeed discus both a possible option a pure bearer token system a exemplified by regular crypto currency would take away the control of the ecb thus according to the ecb such a system can only be allowed when both user are uniquely identified for exle with biometrics e g fingerprint and iris recognition the account based system on the other hand would be operated in the same way a the current banking system this is the preferred system of the ecb where they operate the back end while existing supervised intermediary operate the front end a we see shortly financial service provider ha already been hired to build this system a we speak the infrastructure for the digital euro is being built along with an eu wide digital id this digital id gorned by the eidas regulation aim to help business citizen and public authority carry out electronic interaction this digital id will contain your relevant data such a name address biometrics drir s licence medical data and will be used to facilitate transaction open bank account online shopping financial service such a insurance and god know what else this digital id wa approd in early december but like the cbdc wa already being built and funded long before that central or decentralized controlthe ecb s report repeat the bi s option of having a decentralized settlement system hower the ecb is not going for this model they state that the central bank will control the back end and ha control or all the unit that are to be created other possible featuresother design option are discussed such a the possibility for hardware wearable virtual card with additional feature such a shorter expiration date and spending limit and a pan european merchant solution privacy only for low value transaction the abo statement is from a more recent letter by fabio panetta the driving force behind the digital euro according to him the ecb will explore if they can allow some anonymity in the system the ecb is addressing privacy in response to a public consultation where the ecb asked european citizen what they thought of a european cbdc it receid an avalanche of negati response and privacy wa the most cited worry but the statement of the ecb on privacy are contradictory in public official tout it a an important feature but if you then look at their most recent internal presentation on privacy they explain that user anonymity is not a desirable feature a this would make it impossible to control the amount in circulation and to prent money laundering the truth is that a gradual shift to digital payment implies le privacy by default the ecb suggests that the digital euro should be designed so that the eurosystem should only be able to see the minimum transaction data hower they are settling the transaction and will need to know who is paying what to whom it is quite clear that privacy is not built into the system the ecb suggests that some privacy can be allowed for certain low value payment and offline functionality hower higher value transaction would remain subject to standard control lt programming the european cbdc ecb software packageon the th of december the ecb published a package for financial intermediary to start building application for the digital euro the publication contained cor letter confirming the design choice discussed abo but also a software package with the application programming interface api a set of defined rule that explain how the computer of bank are to communicate with those of the central bank source ecb website digital euro api package this package provides a programming standard for bank and payment provider that ser the general public it allow them to process payment digitally while the eurosystem settle the payment the ecb is testing a system where intermediary get to program different kind of transaction fi company ha been selected to build software integration on a settlement layer hosted by the ecb each will test a different type of transaction a an annex to the article one can download the code of the actual api from the source code a number of additional conclusion can be drawn about the model currently being pursued the digital euro will ha intermediary deal with client and the ecb ultimately settling all the transaction the intermediary creates the payment the eurosystem appro and then a callback confirms the detail of the transaction with detail on the time and date it settled despite the non stop bashing of bitcoin by the ecb the current proposal us the same technology utxo pub private signature and en the same security model secpk a bitcoin the ecb is literally creating a bitcoin rip off and may en be re using open source bitcoin code the ecb will respond to ery payment request with either settled or failed meaning that it ha the ultimate control or what payment do and do not get approval it is unclear what condition would result in a failed payment gin the large number of transaction the ecb will ha to process and the risk of running complex software at a settlement layer it is hard to imagine the ecb programming payment condition for specific case hower running a payment through a sanction list or a list with basic condition might be feasible moreor it seems likely that programming feature will be enforced at the layer abo the settlement layer for exle the ecb is working on a dedicated programmability platform layer between the settlement layer and the intermediary layer source ecb programmable payment in digital euro the documentation explains how intermediary create wallet address on behalf of their client it is only this address the ecb see the more sensiti account detail are kept with the financial service provider this is explained a safeguarding privacy hower a permanent record of all transaction is stored all the ecb need to do is match a name to each address and it see erything it is a of yet unclear how monetary and financial stability objectis are going to be coded into this system it also is not clear how the ecb aim to reconcile the contradiction of limit on account balance and their privacy goal the latest ecb progress update doe not alleviate these worry it state that for online payment the eurosystem itself will record transaction and perform associated rification task and it happens to be that online payment are the category of payment with the broadest set of high lel use case now ask yourself how large a share of payment in a digital currency will be e online in any case it is safe to assume there is not going to be real privacy in this system use with this design either the central bank or the intermediary know the identity of the user behind each transaction u federal reser design of the digital dollarcompared to the ecb the american central bank the federal reser is not a far advanced with designing their cbdc hower in january the fed did release their report money and payment the u s dollar in the age of digital transformation in the opening paragraph the fed repeat the familiar take that cbdcs are a different kind of money compared to existing form and state that in their opinion a cbdc is a digital liability of the federal reser that is widely available to the general public it would be the safest digital asset available to the general public with no associated credit or liquidity risk the report point to the fact that the federal reser act doe not allow direct federal reser account for individual the fed will therefore ha to adopt an intermediary model where the private sector would offer account or digital wallet to facilitate the management of cbdc holding and payment just a with the ecb you will not ha an account directly with the fed but although commercial bank and non bank would offer these service to individual the cbdc itself would be a liability of the federal reser further on the fed argues that a future cbdc should be intermediated widely transferable and identity rified while at the same time being privacy protected these are again contradicting objectis a a use case the fed note that gornments could use a cbdc to collect tax or make benefit payment directly to citizen additionally a cbdc could potentially be programmed to for exle delir payment at certain time again programmable money additionally a cbdc could potentially be used to carry out micro payment and streamline cross border payment by using new technology crucially the fed recap the risk unlimited use of cbdcs pose to the stability of the financial system a such the fed also proposes the variation of interest rate on different kind of money and limit on the amount an end user could hold moreor to prent a flight to safety it proposes limit to the amount a user could accumulate in a short period of time and last but not least the fed discus it monetary policy and the need to expand it balance sheet to accommodate cbdc growth part of this could be mitigated by shifting away from existing non reser liability yes the fed is suggesting withdrawing cash to make room for cbdcs new york fed testing of wholesale cbdcsthere were a number of recent headline reporting that the new york fed had started a week test of their first cdbc hower this project is mostly about exploring the concept of a wholesale cbdc this is a form of cbdc that is only used to settle the liability of regulated financial institution although interesting it doe not tell u much about the future of retail cbdcs which are the main subject of this report fednow payment systemfednow is another project under delopment by the fed that is sometimes confused with a cbdc this facility will enable individual and business to send instant payment between account while the idea of instant settlement reminds u of crypto currency what is settled are not central bank liability a such fednow is not a cbdc system lt conclusion the cbdc prison being builtcentral bank around the world ha started building cbdcs these need to be designed and each design ha consequence when looking at the design choice made so far we can see where thing are headed and it doesn t look good a of now no formal decision ha been made in the jurisdiction discussed regardless the eu s direction seems clear perhaps the u congress still ha a say in the future of money we shall see what we see in the work is a system where small group of unelected people get to appro all payment there will be no privacy it ha purposefully designed feature that control how much money you can hold and what kind of charge and negati interest rate apply a system of constant surillance and the centralization of sensiti information and then we han t en talked about all the other policy increasingly being enforced through the financial system such a a personal co budget or other social credit system the re directing of private resource towards public policy goal blended finance and the exclusion of political undesirable cbdcs replace cash with a kind of money you ner legally own you can directly be charged interest and fee on and cannot spend without permission do you want this source this post is larger than character so i remod the footnote from this post full list of footnote can be found here download this article in pdffor a pdf rsion of this article to store or share click tldr cbdcs are liability directly with the central bank they are a new kind of money next to cash and digital money currently held in private bank the bank of international settlement made an orview of all research into cbdcs it show that each design ha consequence the ecb ha chose for a design where intermediary deal with the client but the ecb settle all payment there is no real privacy in the system to ensure financial stability the ecb wish to maintain control or account balance apply variable interest charge and monetary policy stimulus the digital euro is in a far stage of delopment the federal reser act force the fed to go through intermediary a well the digital usd will be programmable and identity rified to ensure financial stability the fed wish to maintain control on interest charge and maximum account balance the fed also argues that cbdcs might ha to replace cash to maintain a healthy balance sheet the digital usd appears to not be in a far stage of delopment

1,a piggy bank with stablecoins in ethereum using multi signature wallet hi i ha this particular use case and would like to share it so people can recommend any solution besides building the solution myself so here it is i want to keep some usdc or busd under a multi sign wallet which requires signature to spend the fund of signature but i can see a couple of issue with only having party and needing signature to perform anything with any fund in that multi sign first death second separation of the party invold and a need to return fund to each party death if one of the two party dy during the duration of this trust of fund the remaining party need to go through and recor the other party's wallet to do anything with the fund which is an annoyance at best separation let's say any of the invold party want to stop putting money into this trust fund again is that the name of this thing and lea with their corresponding share of the money but the other party doesn't want to sign anything which freeze the fund until the dispute is settled and worst case scenario none of the party doe what the other part asks and a judge get invold to resol the conflict then some solution come to mind solving both particular edge case at the same time involving a third party that play the role of arbitrator it could be a lawyer who represents both party but these cost money and you need to trust the lawyer to do the right thing to me what come to mind is a smart contract is cheaper than a lawyer and you can write one if you know what you are doing to do the right thing but a smart contract can control of the fund and do whater n of m signature request right i wonder if a smart contract can be a signer party in a multi sign wallet my reasoning for that is that the n of m smart contract signer control of the fund if someone smarter than the person writing the contract want to exploit a bug the attacker won't get anything of value use he still need other signer to participate in the hack of the signer in this case okay so the question is there something like this out there in ethereum that can be used for cheap and with a frontend that won't banish suddenly or do i need to build it myself

1,how eips are approd on ethereum a simple explanation an eip can be submitted by anyone and becomes the responsibility of the author once they re created the author informs other delopers of their proposal gather support to build and launch it and document work throughout the process the majority of eips are standard track eips proposal that change the ethereum protocol itself broadly anything that technically change ethereum is a standard track eip there are seral sub type under the standard track core network interface erc core eips core eips are change drastic enough to require a fork in the blockchain fork are when the blockchain split in two use of a major decision with one path following the old rule and the new path following the new one networking eips networking eips are improments to node communication and transaction are transmitted on ethereum transaction are encrypted when sent when i send you fund i'm encrypting a message that only you can decrypt change to these aspect are networking eips interface eips interface eips are improments for how application interact with ethereum they standardize the api used for communication with the blockchain an exle is eip which changed an opcode on ethereum from suicide to self destruct for mental health reason erc eipsfinally erc eips establish new standard on ethereum often for smart contract these standard are responsible for token on ethereum erc and non fungible token erc and many more without these standard token wouldn t be easily tradeable additional eip typesstandard track eips the one listed abo are the most common the le frequent meta eip cors non technical change in process how delopment orall is managed finally instead of proposing new feature informational eips elaborate on existing design detail the eip approval process eip eips can be proposed by anyone but often require the work of multiple people depending on their impact eip editor review eips that are submitted and multiple delopers are usually required to build a feature the effort to reward ratio factor greatly into which proposal are prioritized and which aren t they all follow an identical process that determines which eips get delired first before submitting an eip author should first t the idea with others in the ethereum delopment community assuming the idea is not cored by an existing eip the author creates a draft and submits it to the eip editor there are different eip editor responsible for each sub type of eip they re responsible for making sure the proposal are technically sound once that s e they create the draft rsion of the eip once an eip editor feel like the draft is ready to recei feedback from the community they mo it from being in draft to in review at this stage any member of the ethereum delopment community can share their thought on how the proposal can be improd once complete the eip enters the last call stage this provides a final opportunity for feedback to be shared usually within day if any major change come up the proposal mo back to review if no major feedback arises then the eip mo into the final stage once an eip is final it becomes a candidate to include in ethereum s periodic upgrade called fork the process highlight the importance of individual responsibility in a decentralized environment no feature would be delired if not chioned by at least one person to start and each is only made complete through the process of peer review may the brightest idea win thank you for reading if you learned something interesting sign up to my free newsletter below i'll send you one email a week with a simple write up on a blockchain topic no ad shill or affiliation stay kind stay curious
1,what are the technical role of validators node runner when implementing new core eips i know the whole ecosystem s feedback are taken in before officially passing core eips so they are usually not controrsial by the time they get implemented but technically what are the role of validators when it come to core eip implementation my understanding is after client include the new change validators ha to choose to update to the new client rsions and if they choose not to update then a hard fork would be created what about the role of node runner in this process

1,help please i am confused i bought eth from moonpay but receid weth instead i asked support what happened and they responded only by disabling my moonpay account with no specific reason provided refuse further communication my question for this subreddit are at bottom of the post hi all a little or a week ago i tried to purchase some eth via the top up interface on the torus wallet website using the moonpay option a you can see in both the drop down menu well a the left sidebar the crypto currency option to choose from with moonpay a presented on the torus website are eth matic and usdc a this is my first time making such a purchase i wa extra thorough in checking ery confirmation page email i wa presented with to make sure that the currency selected is eth a i had wanted to make sure i didn t accidentally purchase matic which made it all the more shocking to me when moonpay seems ha sent me weth weth wasn t en an option to choose from via the method interface i used so i fail to see how this could ha en been user my error here is the polyscan link to the transaction i submitted a support request on moonpay s website and receid no reply after day i did recei an automated email immediately after submitting the support request saying they typically respond within hour excluding holiday etc if you want to read it here is the message i submitted to moonpay support along with many of the screenshots in this post no new information i han t already mentioned abo though so you can probably skip or reading it so after day i sent a dm to u moonpaysupport on twitter and got this reply note that wa to this day still is my first only crypto currency related transaction i er e with that wallet or any other wallet that is in fact the first crypto wallet i er had so it s quite literally impossible that i had e anything else in the past with my account wallet history that wa against their term condition i ha literally ner had any crypto currency in my possession ownership until that weth they seem to ha mistakenly sent me instead of the eth i had purchased from them with all that said thank you sincerely if you read through this far my question are am i correct in understanding that i should ha receid eth and not weth there actually is an issue here right gin that u moonpaysupport said this decision is final and we won't be able to provide any further assistance on this matter it seems i ha zero course of action to take in regard to getting the eth i paid for from them any recommendation for where i can reliably safely purchase some eth ideally not from an exchange where i need to submit a bunch of document to open an account i am canadian credit card ha canadian address if that make a difference my resistance towards submitting document to open an account with an exchange isn t use i am trying to remain anonymous or anything but use all i want right now is enough eth to pay for some gas fee to transfer some nfts out of my torus wallet and opening an account with an exchange seems so excessi so much work yet here i am typing out this long as post thank you so much for any help insight any of you can provide
1,would there be a time when eth hold stake them self on simple to use device i ha this question in my mind a i hear fear of eth being more centralized a one of the reason being few validators control majority of staked eth coinbase binance etc a ethereum network being merged to po many long term hodlers are adding eth to stake them m staked i do notice that there is a strong need for being self validator rather in dec cen pool like lido coinbace etc and it not easy rather simple to become validator and stake with eth there fore i ha a suggestion or proposal to bring it to ethereum devs try to bring a mobile mini hard dri device preconfigured and could be become single or multiple validator node's with extension to mobile app to control this device with the size of an iphone connects with wifi lan bluetooth usb charging etc reduce collateral limit from eth to eth or le this way more young instors will start there own validator node i am not sure if there is any device available but this would bring ethereum network security to be more decentralized this is my opinion and i wish this to happen soon if it not already there

1,are there difference in normal token transfer ents and erc token transfer ents so i learnt that erc token ha transfer and transferfrom ent from my understanding transfer ent is when a transaction come from an address to the smart contract instructing the transfer of some of it token to another address transferfrom come from an address that ha been pre approd to transfer token from another address here are my question what ent is triggered when normal transfer of eth from one account to another account occurs what exle are there on how to subscribe to these ents using the jsonrpc endpoint is subscribing to erc token ents different from subscribing to normal ethereum transfer how will same transaction look like using a library like ether r
1,how to get ents pushed instead of polling in ethereum i am trying to see how i can subscribe to an ents on the ethereum blockchain and i can only see polling mechanism and no push mechansimi am look at the documentation for the json rpc endpoint here i can see gin the combination of ethnewfilter ethgetfilterchanges ethgetfilterlogs it is possible to register a filter on an rpc node and poll for change what if i t want to poll but require a push mechanism how can that be e i t see any endpoint with name containing thing like subscribe listen etc so not sure how to go about this

1,what do you find to be the most interesting aspect of eth's history from the beginning ethereum me my fav crypto it seemed more complex and interesting than bitcoin since it is the home of smart contract and decentralized application holding a major share of the total value locked in the sector ethereum s dominance in the dapp market wa up to before other rival platform were created ethereum is still the undisputed king of dapps despite it high fee the platform is still the first choice for different application ranging from finance exchange and storage to gaming nfts and gornance this show how far it ha come since it whitepaper wa published in it seems like it wa yesterday time definitely fly like erything else ethereum started a an idea and unlike bitcoin which wa only intended for financial usage the aim wa to employ blockchain technology to create decentralized application this wa the idea of canadian computer programmer vitalik buterin who is of russian descent today we may en recei free renewable energy thanks to blockchain tech if you look at project like elan future all of these thing appeared so far away just a few year ago i think that it's incredible how much tech evold like erything else eth had it ups and down through all these year but i'm super excited to see how will it evol in upcoming year especially use the upgrade is expected to be fully implemented around or beyond this mean that until then ethereum will likely continue to depend on off chain scaling solution such a layer and sidechains what do you find most amazing when it come to ethereum

1,visa is looking at way it can help the ethereum ecosystem delop ha you heard about visa's most recent relation that it is working to implement auto payment on ethereum through the delopment of a nol wallet type a procedure dubbed account abstraction by the company according to what i' heard visa did in fact issue a technical paper in which it looked into the idea of creating an automatic payment mechanism for ethereum self custodial wallet i find it amazing what we can all do with the help of modern technology cryptocurrencies and other thing in addition to the payment system the ticketing industry and other thing blockchain may also prent the production of free clean energy i also think that the energy sector will use blockchain in the near future the amount of electricity needed to meet the world's energy need a well a the effect of the global community on the climate and the cost of energy might be greatly reduced thanks to this cutting edge technology claim elan future enabling auto payment for self custodial wallet is difficult in light of the recent visa and eth news a doing so may require granting access to one's private key to a smart contract that will be making the payment on their behalf in essence auto payment ha the potential to jeopardize the security offered by self custody the process of confirming a transaction on the blockchain would apparently become more flexible a a result of all of this in my opinion visa for exle belies it would permit multi owner account through multi sig and public account from which anybody may do business

1,will a transaction with no priority fee use up the gas limit from ledger's website gt you can send transaction without adding a priority fee hower keep in mind that setting a ry low priority fee is risky transaction may wait in a pool until the entire gas limit is used up this confuses me i think i understand the concept of gas limit and i t see how it applies here my understanding wa that until a transaction is picked it sits in the mempool and doesnt burn any gas if it's picked then only gas limit matter not max fee nor max priority fee in other word is there a risk to setting max fee that are too low apart from getting a stuck transaction

1,idea how we could create timelocked transaction backup to recor ether from lost key i ha been thinking a lot lately about key management and fund recory it occurred to me that we could create a system that allows u to recor fund from lost key by signing time bound transaction which can sweep our fund in the ent that we lose access in a nutshell this work by signing a transaction that deploys a contract which sends fund to another address this could be a friend family member or en your exchange and setting time constraint such a not valid before and or not valid after you can also sign many of these transaction with multiple nonce value so that you still ha a valid transaction in the ent that you make future transaction since this signed transaction is constrained to the recipient and certain time criterion it is not sensiti and can be stored anywhere including on the cloud a a user you ha the power to invalidate the transaction at anytime by either spending the fund or using up all the nonce i ha started creating a prototype here let me know what you think of the concept and how you would impro it merry christmas

1,a simple explanation of eof evm object format eof is the biggest upgrade in the evm's history coming in the shanghai fork in march eof will completely change how ethereum work here's a summary eip the first upgrade in eof change how instruction to the evm are structured specifically it establishes a structure where one didn t really exist before it split bytecode into two string of character one containing code and the other containing data this eip also make it easier to upgrade the evm it creates a system to distinguish new contract and what feature each is using the evm executes each program based on the rsion of the evm it wa released in so new upgrade can be delired more easily eip this introduces the concept of code validation specifically when a smart contract is deployed contract today aren t validated by the ethereum network before they re deployed they get validated a they re executed by people validating contract upon deployment sa significantly on execution cost program are validated once upon deployment and any necessary data for operation is made available in the data section of the bytecode eip quick tangent stack machine can be imagined a glass container tall and thin they execute instruction and store data in these glass container the first piece of data is placed at the bottom and erything afterwards get placed on top in a stack stack machine ha pointer that can mo between piece of data to read them the way ethereum shift it pointer today is with a jump which requires a destination or a jumpdest eip 's new opcodes enables the ethereum stack machine to shift it pointer far more efficiently this result in cheaper gas fee both for deploying a contract a well a for interacting with one it also make on chain analysis easier eip this introduces function that the stack itself can perform function are instruction that need to be performed more than once in a program writing such instruction once a a function make program more efficient leading to cost saving on ethereum currently function t exist at the bytecode lel that the stack machine executes on ethereum to repeat instruction the jump and jumpdest opcodes are instead used to shift the pointer to where an instruction is when it need to be executed eip this eip focus on validating contract upon deployment but by looking for error the stack machine might encounter called stack orflows or underflows stack orflow when a stack is out of space stack underflow retrieving data from an empty stackdespite stack orflows and underflows being basic error they can occur on ethereum today the check to prent them are introduced with this eip eof is a suite of eips together making evm execution more efficient more consistent and more easily upgradeable eof itself is first upgrade in the evm's history and can be expected in the shanghai hard fork in march if you'd like to learn more read the full write up on my free newsletter below

1,putting stock on the blockchain from le liquid exchange i wanted to share a thought i had about how putting stock on the blockchain could help stock exchange in le liquid market attract instments and impro the li of those in the region and the best part is it could all be e while encouraging transparency and giving liquidity provider a new way to inst in the stock market so what do i mean by le liquid market these are stock exchange in region or country where there isn't a much trading activity this can make it difficult for company to raise the capital they need to grow and succeed and it can also make it hard for instors to find good opportunity but by putting stock on the blockchain these exchange can potentially attract more instment from around the world the transparency and security of the blockchain can make it easier for instors to feel confident about putting their money into these market and for the company listed on these exchange it can provide a new source of funding and a way to tap into a global instor base but it's not just about attracting more instment by bringing more activity to these exchange we can also help to impro the li of those in the region when company are able to raise the capital they need they can create job dri economic growth and contribute to the orall well being of the community and for automatic market maker liquidity provider this could be a fun and exciting new way to inst in the stock market instead of just being limited to the major exchange they can now potentially access a whole new world of opportunity and help to dri liquidity in these le liquid market

1,l protocol finally seem to be gaining traction l protocol finally seem to be gaining traction which is good news for ethereum at this point it would seem plausible to conclude that ethereum ha successfully used network effect and the first mor advantage in the field of smart contract technology and that it should now be trying to expand on this a stage that layer s can enable which one do you employ i'm used to metis a scaling solution that also seek to enhance the dao idea by making it into something more serious through what it refers to a a dac the ethereum network which ha the most deloper activity and is the only cryptocurrency that is not obscure to those who are not acti in crypto may continue to be at the center of web a it delops a a sign of ethereum's trustworthy reputation i'd say that eth is the only cryptocurrency except for bitcoin which can be seen a a somewhat conservati digital asset to own or the long run although ethereum is currently dominant and should remain so it would be wrong to claim that there is no potential for any rival layer s a direct competitor to ethereum that offer identical functionality without the gas cost and scaling issue is referred to a alternati layer

1,short passage to be explained like am guy i usually get english but this time it all going or my head i know what finality mean i know both finalisation and justification upgrade but the following did not make sense to me finality requires a two third agreement that a block is canonical an attacker cannot possibly create an alternati finalized chain without owning or manipulating two third of the total staked ether destroying at least one third of the total staked ether the first condition arises use two third of the staked ether is required to finalize a chain the second condition arises use if two third of the total stake ha voted in favor of both fork then one third must ha voted on both double voting is a slashing condition that would be maximally punished and one third of the total stake would be destroyed what i understood of total eth staked need to be vote for upgradation of the concerned block the abo alone and not en the reasoning or how this voting happens like if they ask for finalising justifying x block or is all of that e by only asking which chain is the correct latest blockchain state or what exactly is asked can someone please simplify this for me i do not understand anything from the second condition paragraph please explain me that paragraph in simple manner

1,ml for detecting dodgy contract to me it seems like one of the most common problem in crypto is dodgy smart contract people sign stuff from wallet that they shouldn't be signing use it lead to them losing a lot of money i thought it would be a good idea to train a ml model that take in various input i'll list some out below to get an idea and determines whether the contract is a scam or not or at least generates some safeness score i think it could also store this in a database that could be publicly available either through an api or maybe through a blockchain exles of factor would be website age github star presence transaction history history of people having problem website itself something like codex applied to the contract to understand what it doe and determine if it is a scami think there are many more input that can be considered and the goal is obviously to reduce fraud in the crypto space and make it a bit more trustworthy what do people think

1,smart contract utility explanation this is what someone said when i said smart contract were useful can anyone debunk it no they are not useful and some of them are so insane that i can't belie anybody who spent more than second thinking about them would er think they're useful it en touch on the fatal flaw of smart contact while falsely claiming they're the solution gt if there s a dispute between the two party a gornmental third party must get invold in many case this third party will also play a role in the creation of the contract ok so what if there actually is a dispute the contract say x is supposed to happen but enforcement is automatic based on certain condition but what about condition that aren't able to be included in the contract sure rent is due on the first but the water wa off for a week and the tenant doesn't owe the full amount all contract for stuff in the real world still ha to abide by the legal system which mean ultimately court need to be able to control what happens en if someone absolutely refuse to play along imagine you're trying to sell a house using smart contract do you en own the house in the first place just use you ha some token saying you do doesn't mean you actually do if someone steal your private key do they now own your house if the token is not the actual definiti record of ownership and it absolutely should not be then you han't remod reliance on third party but just added an irrelevant not legally binding aspect to the system and of course all of this is assuming that we can make smart contract perfect without any error code can and will ha error and many people ha already lost fortune due to poorly written contract if there's no enforcement system external to the contract it's not usable in the real world if there is an external system then the smart contract is no longer the definiti truth and sers no useful purpose

1,here s how l are planning on moving from fast to en faster l ha made major gain in the recent year and ha deloped new tech and upped their throughput ethereum a well ha pushing into upgrading the chain in a way that boost l throughput dank sharding towards the end of hower regardless of how fast a chain l can process transaction there will always be the issue of dependency what are dependency dependency are the result of blockchains and in extension l processing transaction in a sequential manner dependency is when ery transaction relies on the one before it in order for it to get executed this mean that while a blockchain l might ha great processing power all of that power is being focused on one transaction at a time regardless of how significant said transaction really is this put a massi restraint on the capability that a blockchain l is capable of performing think of it a you buying a new packaging machine for your factory this packaging machine ha slot to handle multiple package at the same time hower your factory only ha one conyor belt meaning so you can technically work package at a time but practically you re restrained by the sequential order you re forced to follow how are l trying to sol this issue one way of solving this issue is implementing a parallel evm engine aptos lab deloped a block stm engine and to make it short and uncomplicated for the arage reader what this doe is it executes a bunch of transaction in parallel it doe that under the assumption that none of the transaction conflict one l polygon adopted a similar approach to their evm in order to scale ethereum but it came with it own set of complication use polygon process a massi volume of transaction the system that aptos came up with won't work use in a hugely adopted system like the polygon po acting a if there were no dependency anywhere in any block won t work it would be taking a theoretical idea too farwhat polygon did instead wa write transaction in a data structure called dag if you want you can expand your knowledge on this but in order to sa time and not make thing complicated what this doe is take dependency into consideration and then execute transaction before validating so that the metadata with deduced dependency can be easily executed what doe this mean for ethereum while there still aren t any parallel evm chain right now a we saw certain l like polygon are working on deloping one and hopefully this push other l to follow suitthis is definitely an added value for ethereum in ethereum s new roadmap the chain will rely solely on l for scalability so this will be major news considering that a delopment like this one will most likely double the throughput that any l is currently putting out all of which will benefit ethereum since it main issue ha always been scalability restraint

1,how ha the transition to po gone so far been researching and adding up my stake in xmr and bch but eth is catching my eye a bit more hower the previous two coin are proof of work which i think i understand the pro and con of well enough proof of stake on the other hand ha me getting pretty mixed feedback and i'm not sure what to think a there appears to still be much uncertainty about the pro con of po v pow from what i gather some thought are pro more energy efficient not inherently a bad thing to use a lot of energy but a lot of energy wa mined in china which us le clean source such a coal or natgas faster lower time complexity and all that more scalable a le computation power is required that mean it can run much more smoothly a eth is something of an instment rather than something backed by computation con more beneficial to centralization and the rich by the model though i will note this arguably applies to pow a any oligarch who wanted to take or could pay someone with technical expertise to set up their own rig and pay them a commission or something like that allowing potentially for censorship and coopting whether by force or by a attack le secure validators could be bribed more threatened by censorship than pow coin i for one think gornment ha no role to play in the creation or regulation of money and that no man should ha control or it in other word i support the separation of state and money for the good of the mass mixed neutral still ha high gas fee use case is defi rather than outright cash though in theory perhaps it could be used for that a well bch is trying to get into defi a well from my understanding so perhaps eth could do something in the other direction is this correct are the con orstated i know le about po and eth defi in general than i do pow or the coin mentioned abo all feedback appreciated

1,idea for pp exchange that run faster and more smoothly than a cex hey eryone i had an idea for a pp exchange like bisq for uk and eu but us open banking ob to get around many of the shortcoming that bisq ha i want to get feedback on this preamble recently you may or may not know that stripe released it own r in the u a ha moonpay etc i used the moonpay one a few time to buy small amount of eth for quick test when i t want to use my main wallet on a transaction i wa charged and stripe also take a ridiculous cut obviously it possible to go through cexs but it not easy to integrate a low fee r onto a defi website and from a cex and people dislike cex s for a variety of good reason it s incredibly frustrating seeing large fee or complex process to get token into my wallet from fiat bisq ha two major flaw in my opinion besides the fact it in the u im from the uk which i would say is more forward facing on the fintech side there is little control or order size it not super liquid the payment method are dodgy on the fiat side most importantly require proof of transaction which is difficulti propose an exchange that combine bisq s framework with open banking and some inspiration from uniswap that should allow virtually free pp trustless flexible ring a seller put their erc token in a liquidity pool smart contract and sign a hash with the block number which is communicated to the buyer a buyer enters the amount they wish to buy and the price is determined by an amm or get the spot price from uniswap binance an algorithm figure out eryone they need to pay and generates a qr to pay eryone you can bank transfer multiple people at the same time in the uk for free and instantly using ob called pisp the hash is in the reference hashed with the buyer address an algorithm scan the seller data to look for the hash and once it is there us the hash to unlock the contract using some zk proof and can generate the address from the signed hash of the seller or scan the buyer bank data to ensure the transaction ha been made once the contract receis this proof it sends the buyer address the stored token this is the simple rsion i thought alot about the associated problem including being unable to rify account data etc to what extent doe this rely on a centralized entity etc the conclusion i reached is that this should feel completely seamless for the buyer thanks to open banking i e scanning qr code i belie in interoperability not competition between good cefi innovation and defi it is completely non custodial at all stage there is actually no cost in this entire process except that of transferring the token to sell to a contract i think the concept of liquidity provider earning some fee like a on uniswap can fix potential liquidity problem grateful for any feedback

1,a thought experiment imagine a powerful authoritarian gornment ccp potentially or maybe en the usa felt threatened by ethereum and wanted to attack the network in such a way that they were willing to pour billion or en trillion of dollar into the attack we know that buying a huge portion of eth would dri the price up but let's say cost is not something they care about they then spin up a huge number of validators and node they find a way to attack the network in such a way that many feel there is a real threat of course the chain would fork and those validators would be slashed or black listed perhaps of their eth is lost but at the same time this cause a crisis of faith en if only short lid causing the price to fall imagine they are with some bank or something also shorting eth with significant lerage they earn more eth than they lose then they use this eth to repeat the attack ad infinitum how would the network handle this

1,the fact that centralized platform hold this much power in a space centered around decentralization is a problem this isn t what vitalik or satoshi envisioned the entire reason cryptocurrencies were created to begin with use of centralized institution like bank and gornments taking control through financial mean these centralized exchange and other cefi platform aren t any different they ha full control or our hard earned fund and can legally do whater they want with them this is not to mention that they re regulatory compliant meaning the gornment can basically tell them what to do how did it come this far ethereum and it dapps are a thing for a reason why use a centralized exchange when dexs are a thing especially when you take into consideration that they come with many more perk the defi is expensi argument had long been dead with the adnt of l and other scaling solution the ogs like arbitrum and optimism are there for a reason and now you got ethereum based organization like bitdao insting hundred of million of dollar into scaling solution which resulted in l like mantle with hyperscalability feature for dapps and web tech i d hate to see all of this r d money being wasted while we inst more into centralized exchange why t we take advantage of all of this tech and the fact that l ha become way more powerful and start insting in defi instead i m sick and tired of seeing people lose money use of the recklessness of centralized exchange

1,protocol proposal feedback appreciated repost hi i made an earlier post outlying an idea for a protocol i had but i think it wa explained too poorly so i' deleted that and tried to do a better job here quick bit of background im a college student who's been in crypto seriously for about a year the fundamental difference between this and the fiat system is custody or key and one of the big barrier imo is people being afraid to store their own key so i' come up with an insurance protocol for your key essentially i want to know what people think about an open source protocol idea i ha simply speaking it a way to back up your key by encrypting them with information only know would know and then storing this on the blockchain a basic illustration could be i could take my key encrypt them with my bank detail passport number mother maiden name etc and store that on chain i would also ha some record of what i ha used for the encryption i e e mother name bla bla bla obviously the stuff you encrypt it with ha to be stuff you won't forget in year and that only you should know i ha a list of such thing the motivation for this to ha a copy of key accessible should you lose a hardware wallet change pc metamask go down etc or any black swan ents like this but it could be a good backup
1,mining pool a mining pool is a joint group of cryptocurrency miner who combine their computational resource or a network to strengthen the probability of finding a block or otherwise successfully mining for cryptocurrency there are different shade of mining a miner can mine by oneself gt though she would recei all the reward without having to pay anyone else the approach is usually impractical in reality for casual miner with a mining rig or two the difficulty in popular blockchains like ethereum ha become so high that finding a block would take year joining a mining pool gt a miner could join a mining pool by adding her hash power to the power of the group when anyone in the pool find a valid block the reward is shared among the miner proportional to the work they ha submitted joining a cloud mining gt instead of owning the hardware required to mine herself either individually or in a pool the miner could rent time from existing miner who operate the hardware

1,smart contract proposal for backing up key planning on building some opensource software smart contract trying to see if my protocol is well thought through feel free to shit on itmotivationa lot of people getting into crypto are concerned about losing their key hardware wallet balancing losing your key with them being easily found is a tough line to draw i m going to propose a protocol to securely back up your key and i wanted opinion on it the goal is to accelerate crypto mass adoption by ensuring non crypto fanatic can trust that they wont chuck their life saving away on a piece of paper in a recycling bin requirementsi spent a while thinking about the necessary requirement of a good system and my proposal is centered around the following requirement so i d be appreciati of criticism of the requirement a they greatly affect the proposal security standard independent of any rd party obviously this ha part firstly you do not rely on a rd party to access said protocol secondly no rd party can access your key under any reasonable circumstance for exle an authenticator app could be hacked at least but realistically better than bank security so it should be more difficult for a hacker to access this than your bank account anonymous full anonymity preview zk proof encryption open source all crucial code should be held within smart contract that doe not require front end software to functioni also came up with some practical requirement for this to work proof must be timeless i e something a simple a your car registration plate is insufficient a this could change proof must be easy there must be zero ambiguity in what you need to provide including detail like formatting proof must be accessible there must not be any doubt that the seeker should be able to recor their key in an emergency proof should be editable in case situation change contain redundancy in case some information is for whater reason lost must not be biometric not easy to pro not standardized mean to measure it not easily always accessible let say in year who know if fingerprint id will be a thing encodingencoding contains stage public id you enter piece of publicly identifiable information pbid from the stage list and encrypt this using a symmetrical hashing algorithm in s creating c combination of information each is stored in mapping along with a signed rsion of this information private identifier you enter a many piece of prid from the stage list and encode these in triplet using a symmetrical hashing algorithm next you encrypt this with decryption key d which must start with a hexadecimal representation of your public key and be character additionally long you store this with your public key in mapping so each address corresponds to a list of encrypted data personal identifier perid you can now create and answer and provide a hint to personal question and encrypt these with d you then hash your private key mnemonic with d and hash the result with each combination of x answer you then store these in mapping a a list of hexadecimals decodingfirst you select piece of pbid to hash and find the signed rsion from m you then recor your address using any zero knowledge algorithm to preser anonymity and check if your wallet is of value before continuing you repeat the process with prid and recor d you repeat with perid and combine with d to recor your private key list pubid name mother maiden name phone number license email address account number sortcode priid passport number card number proof of email address the question will be forer hidden so you can pick anything embarrassing that big corporation wouldn't know small point why do we need perids if only i can access prids realistically you will use rd party software to put prids onchain so we satisfy requirement why do we ha prids gin then abo if perids work by themsels requirement you do not wanted jilted ex who may know some of your perids to get in why do we need zk instead of identifying people by their hashed pubids use you want to separate the process of knowing pubids and perids and having a public key could be inherently and independently useful also for this information to be updatable we must be able to use address to id the updater especially considering thing in list may change

1,is validator uptime actually a vulnerability signal hear me out before burning me at the stake here there are many assumption taken in this post o client fallback client etc and en more edge case that refute my thought this post is intended to shed light on a general case that may apply to many validators if not most gin it would seem to affect vanilla validator configuration validator uptime is a publicly discernable attribute through missed attestation and a anybody running a validator should know critical node maintenance like security update oftentimes require a system restart that would result in publicly viewable downtime if i wa a malicious actor that wanted to attempt to gain access to validator key by compromising these node then this uptime metric could provide me a fast and easy short list of validators that likely ha not gone through this maintenance effort i could en rank my list depending on how long the validator ha been online targeting node that potentially ha not been restarted in month or year with the assumption that security exploit are more effecti on these node missing a few attestation is relatily painless from a financial perspecti if a node operator is hellbent on not performing maintenance on their system for whater reason would it make sense to pay a few cent each month and create a script that would cut network activity to the node for a few hour at the end of ery month if it were me i think i would pay this low cost to avoid being placed on the malicious actor short list then again if it were me i would just update my node instead

1,need advice if anyone know i need like worth of eth for gas fee coinbase won't let me send anything out for day metamask all require a ssn for a direct fiat buy which doesn't seem safe to me is there any easy way i can buy eth with fiat that requires little or no kyc
1,i' been wondering how some nfts make money when they sell for a little a and people pay exorbitant fee did you er think about how people decide on nft price or how you price nfts i' been wondering how some nfts make money when they sell for a little a and people pay exorbitant fee that's why i' been thinking about this question market for nfts began to gain traction in and by the end of march this new market for digital asset had a total lifetime traded volume of approximately million some of the frequently asked question are how doe one price their art and what is the best strategy for selling nfts despite the lack of predefined pricing strategy for nonfungible token nft seller may choose to sell them at the listing price in a secondary market alternatily they may complete the sale at a price that a buyer is willing to pay referred to a the buyer price use of this gaming nfts are the easiest to deal with nfts can be rewarded with battle gameplay armor weapon or who know what a in wam tournament a you can see i'm more interested in gaming nfts so i'm not sure how pricing work for different type of nfts en so i belie that if you set your price too high you risk ner being able to sell that item and that if you set your price too low gradually raising it will be more difficult what are your opinion
1,could anyone help my stupid self i need like of eth for gas fee and coinbase make you wait day to send out any amount of crypto just need one person to send me with of eth and i'll send you of usdc idk where to get eth easily only one person i will not do this for multiple people if you can do it i highly appreciate you or anyone ha a solution please let me know xaabadddbbcceecfe

1,i made a news aggregator app called ethsummary that summarizes ethereum related news hi eryone so inspired by a question i asked about a week ago now about eryone's favorite news source i started work on an ethereum news summary app it pull news from twitter account and reddit thread specifically at ethereum and at vitalikbuterin and currently at sbf for tweet and r ethereum and r ethfinance for reddit pull from bankless and adding disrupt in a few day and then general news site exclusily eth related stuff polishing up the edge but i wanted to share it here and see what you guy think also opinion on account subreddits to add would be awesome it update itself ery or so minute hope this is something you find helpful gonna get a proper domain name soon heroku's a bit hard to work with
1,how do stablecoins make money eli hi eryone doe anyone know how stablecoin issuer like circle tether and makerdao make money it's all a bit unclear to me and after recent ents i ha started to do more due diligence about crypto product some of them are really unclear or i'm just stupid anyways saw this picture on twitter and it made me think where are the interest rate margin gained from from decentralised lending platform like aa or from exchange with lending or do they lend usdt usdc busd to institution thanks to whoer help me understand and ha a good sunday

1,where to buy eth without plaid more often than not i'm buying ethereum on binance i wa funding my usd balance through plaid until i found out about the amount of access plaid ha to my banking institution i know i know i should' looked into them a little more but i did it out of connience and low fee damage is e let's mo on currently i'm using a debit card but this incurs a fee not the worst fee i' er seen but i'm sure there are better option out there so the question is how are you guy buying ethereum and what are the fee not too worried about kyc it's something i' learned to li with unfortunately
1,sent eth from coinbase it's showing a 'internal txn' on etherscan and not receid so i purchased regular eth from coinbase and sent it to a temp deposit address on a website the transaction is i 't use eth too much but this doesn't look to me like a normal eth transaction i think it's coinbase wrapped eth or something i'm confused use i repeated the process and i definitely bought normal ethereum from coinbase is this normal i' lost my money on the site a it say they 't accept transfer from contract

1,crypto gaming need to be fun to be successful money doesn't matter do you agree do you think that most cryptocurrency game today lack the mechanic to keep player interested for en a short period of time i read one interesting article about this and made me think why han t more top tier game introduced real world reward into their game i'm referring to title in which of gamers are not professional esports athlete and recei no monetary compensation for thousand of hour spent playing their favorite game the possibility of introducing monetary incentis ha always been on the table why hasn't it been game need to avoid injecting monetary reward into an experience that is designed to be intrinsically rewarding the gameplay should be most important use that's the thing that keep player attracted to the game and entertained ha you seen how awesome wam tournament are well that's the exact reason i'm captivated by that game it's insane and we need more game that are fun and worth playing the fact is that nobody will inst hundred of hour in an activity that isn't fun unless it pay a lot of money and you can only pay out a large sum of money if a large number of user collaborate to create a significant amount of value this quickly becomes a death spiral for nascent crypto game a the game are unable to generate enough value to adequately reward player for spending hour inside an unrewarding game loop instead of starting with economics or haphazardly adding crypto to a working game loop delopers should create game that people want to play a play to earn mechanism could destroy the retention of en a fantastic game with high retention number what are your thought

1,where will sol project go i know posting in eth community the obvious answer is this should make project mo toward a pron decentralized chain and i think that make sense and some will choose eth but they chose sol or eth initially primarily due to cost so will there still be a market for lower cost option albeit with more scrutiny i still belie multiple chain will meet differing need just curious if en a few agree if so who is next up to fill void just to be clear i think eth will still dominate market share but curious which chain will ha a better share with sol faltering

1,the fictitiousness of the consensus algorithm the failure of decentralization and the emergence of nonblockchain the content is ry long pre scrolling is recommended definitionthe blockchain is operated based on a plurality of node configured in a pp method countless transaction are submitted moment by moment from client all or the world towards countless node spread all or the world the result of these transaction are recorded on all node and in particular the content should be the same orall in order to realize this the rule that all node must follow is the consensus algorithm to describe it more conceptually it can be defined a a method in which a specific node is selected by a certain rule especially by the decentralization principle the selection and execution order of transaction is determined by the selected node and other good willed node independently rify and execute the content of individual transaction and store them in their database a such consensus algorithm can be clearly defined hower many people are misunderstanding this definition the subject of consensusthere is a serious misunderstanding about it of the general public misunderstands this point and most of the dapp programmer who ha not built the mainnet themsels are misunderstood or ambiguous this is en shown on ethereum's official website there is no understanding of the definition of the consensus algorithm mentioned abo or it is ambiguous the fundamental cause of this problem is the illusion about the subject of consensus in short en though the content of the transaction that's the authenticity of the author is not a subject of consensus it is often mistaken the only subject of the consensus are the selection of transaction and the order in which they are implemented a the content of the transaction exactly the authenticity of the author the transaction that a sends eth to b is electronically signed with a private key and deployed to the blockchain network the authenticity of the transaction creator is judged by each of all pp node it doesn't get help from anyone outside and it doesn't ask anyone outside hower most ordinary people and surprisingly many dapp programmer mistake the authenticity of the content or the author's authenticity a the subject of consensus hower this is not the subject of consensus but of anti consensus a famous pharase about this is the following do not trust rify a a result en if all other node in ethereum conspired to forge the transaction and store it in the database the honest node doe not care about it at all and rifies the transaction by itself and store it in it own database and new node joining afterwards will follow the honest node b selection and execution order of transactionsthese are the genuine subject of consensus no more no le not all transaction submitted to the blockchain are selected and the selected transaction are not executed in the order in which they are submitted this is use it is theoretically impossible a long a the concept of a block of finite capacity is premised therefore there arises a problem of deciding how many transaction to accept in one block and in what order to execute them it is the problem of the consensus algorithm and in itself this becomes the definition of it i selection of transactionsfor exle assuming that suddenly one billion transaction are pushed in one second it becomes impossible to put them in one block therefore we ha no choice but to choose some of them in this case most mainnets collect transaction in the order of high gas price and put them in block therefore en transaction submitted first in time may not be included in the block if the gas price is low they also run later than other transaction with high gas price en if they are contained in block for reference the existing centralized system sol this problem by creating a queue so en if a billion transaction suddenly hit in a second it can theoretically accept and process the whole transaction ii order of execution of transactionsthis is also usually determined based on gas price maybe all the mainnets are doing that and i' ner heard of that exception in this case it is natural that the possibility of manipulation occurs the answer of existing blockchain protocol to this are a follows code is law it mean that you are responsible for not checking the law in advance this is simply an irresponsible attitude for exle if an incompetent legislator incorrectly entered the amount of parking fine and added another zero the legislator is not at fault and you are an idiot for not checking the law this is the current state of the blockchain in the dao crisis the law wa entually forced to be revised now it should be law is code the order of execution of transaction must be in the order in which they were submitted at least they should try to do that hower the existing mainstream platform insist that the current gas price auction system is the right way offering only poor excuse of course eryone know that it is a lazism the birth of the block conceptas described abo the current consensus algorithm ha a fundamental problem nertheless the reason satoshi and buterin adopted this method wa to make centralized manipulation impossible in the selection and execution order of transaction that's they sacrificed the general principle of pre submissionism to pursue decentralization by the way in order to pursue decentralization in the satoshi sense the order of selection and execution of transaction must be determined by a node rather than a specific node hower if countless client submit their transaction to a myriad of node the unity of the orall database will be broken if the transaction are executed in the order submitted for each node therefore he wa forced to seek way to select and order transaction by any random node and to allow other node to accept them to this end it is needed to establish rule on who will make decision on selection and who will follow them a selected by a duly elected selection decision maker other node follow it and execute each transaction and store it in their own database thereby maintaining the orall database uniformity it wa the pow that satoshi came up with a a way to determine who ha the authority to make the abo selection decision that mean that the person who sol the high lel math problem the fastest will be gin the right to decide on the selection of transaction hower in order to do this you need time to sol math problem and during that period the transaction queue is accumulated at this point satoshi came up with the concept of the ry block it is the miner who succeeds in solving the math problem satoshi established a rule that the miner selects all or some of the transaction accumulated during the period of solving mathematical problem put them in one block and executes them and all other node follow the rule the block concept of blockchain wa born in this con limitation of the meaning of decentralization in blockchainas such the block concept emerged a a methodical element to make it impossible to manipulate in the adoption and order of execution of transaction it wa the best way within the limit of satoshi's intelligence the reason satoshi adopted the block concept wa of course to achie the idea of decentralization despite innumerable problem such a the execution delay of transaction during the block generation time the rersal of the transaction execution order and uncertainty of being selected in the block satoshi belied that decentralization would be guaranteed if a node wa selected from among the innumerable good willed node spread around the world and those node determined the selection and execution order of transaction and he thought that if only the decentralization wa guaranteed he could endure a number of problem caused by block generation if so it is necessary to calmly examine the advantage of the decentralization compared to the centralization system at the expense of such considerable cost for this it is good to make a comparison in other word it is assumed that there is one centralized node and that this node determines the selection and execution order of transaction and other node follow suit next the decentralization system is compared with this first there is no difference in the content of the transaction whether it is a centralization method or a decentralization method this is use forgery is impossible thus the transaction in which a transfer bitcoin to b work exactly the same on these two system and is also stored in the database in the same way it is also impossible for the centralization system operator to produce the abo manipulated transaction from the beginning and both system are the same in this respect hower there are difference between the two system in the selection of transaction and in determining the order of execution the problem is that it is necessary to examine whether the difference is essential or relati speaking from the conclusion the difference is only a relati difference and in particular in term of fairness that is prention of manipulation it can be said that there is nothing better than a centralized system in a decentralized system let's look at this in detail the manager x of the centralized system can arbitrarily manipulate the selection and execution order of the first transaction in which a transfer bitcoin to b and the second transaction in which a transfer bitcoin to c so if x hate b los c and a's current balance is bitcoin x can make the bitcoin which is normal to be transferred to b be transferred to c by manipulating the order of transaction or omitting the first transaction at all satoshi wa aware of the abo problem and a a countermeasure he studied how to empower random node operator to decide the selection and order of execution of transaction the result of the study wa mining and the concept that arose a an inevitable result of the mining wa the block finally at first it seemed that satoshi's idea could be realized without obstacle if there are innumerable node and an arbitrary or random node operator determines the selection and execution order of the transaction it can be admitted that virtually no one can manipulate it hower the reality did not go a satoshi thought the first typical situation wa the emergence of the mining king in china he wa able to exert the power of the operator of a centralized node to some extent based on the enormous hash power and most of all the critical scene wa the dao incident ethereum foundation and a series of sympathizer ha artificially manipulated the selection and execution order of the transaction to generate an artificial fork since then countless artificial fork ha been implemented in the blockchain ecosystem a a result satoshi's logic of decentralization ha virtually collapsed a an inevitable result the block concept ha now fallen into a relati rather than an absolute concept in the blockchain in fact en if it wa not the chinese mining king or the dao crisis there wa always a possibility of manipulation by arbitrary node operator that is the case when a node operator is preparing to manipulate at that time in case he succeeds in mining if he prepares manipulated code and allows the code to be executed when he succeeds in mining or is selected a a validator he can manipulate them for exle with simple code manipulation it is possible to change the selection and order of execution of transaction in a low rather than high order of gas price a such decentralization through mining and block wa originally an incomplete method it wa not a digital but an analog concept that is on a different lel from the absolute concept of the impossibility of forgery by electronic signature and this result applies equally to po whether the stake is large or small a node operator can manipulate the selection and execution order of transaction a long a he is selected a a validator but the problem 't end here it's time to ask a more fundamental question is it reasonable to fundamentally determine the selection and order of execution of transaction based on gas price to say the conclusion in advance it is a manipulation in itself it's nothing more and nothing le than to benefit someone who ha offered more bribe let's look at it in detail in general it is right to execute the transaction receid first for exle no matter how much remittance fee are offered to a bank it ner change the remittance order use it is a principle of nature to process remittance in chronological order there is no reason to treat this principle differently in blockchain therefore if the order is to be rersed a corresponding unavoidable reason must be presented satoshi's answer to this is a follows by extracting transaction in the order of higher gas price the platform can prent infinite repetiti attack this is not a reasonable presentation this is a simple security issue and a topic unrelated to decentralization that's it is not an issue to be considered in the stage of building the core of the blockchain that should be considered once the essential structure of the blockchain is completed in other word in the core stage it is right to complete the basic structure so that the transaction are executed in chronological order therefore the infinite repetition attack problem should be considered in the process of considering various secondary problem of the basic structure that ha been completed primarily in the process it is the right programming mindset to devise and install a new appropriate additional device separately also such a device is easily conceivable for exle you can find a lot of great method en at the lel of common sense such a conducting transaction in chronological order receiving cost in term of security rather than gas and returning them if there are no problem later unfortunately it is assumed that satoshi did not ha time to come up with such an idea a a result the gas cost were forcibly inserted into the core part of the blockchain under the wrong name that's the security cost were inserted under the name of gas cost the aftereffect of satoshi's decision on subsequent blockchains were sere in conclusion satoshi's decentralized method could not achie it original purpose the selection and execution order of transaction could be manipulated and more fundamentally determining them based on the gas price is just manipulation in itself the gas cost priority policy is an unusual manipulation against the common sense that the transaction receid first should be implemented first and the reason for that manipulation wa also poor in conclusion it is inevitable to raise fundamental question about satoshi's decentralization method that is the block method itself this is not just an issue for bitcoin but a problem for ethereum and all other blockchains disappearance of the blockif all transaction can continue from beginning to end without manipulation and the database can be stored equally on all node the purpose of the blockchain is achied a curious result emerges here that is the fact that the concept of a block is not necessary to achie that purpose in addition the fact that none of the existing blockchains achied the essential purpose of the blockchains mentioned abo perfectly at least satisfactorily make u surprised that mean that the block is a failed concept a shown by the comparison of the two system abo it cannot be guaranteed that the decentralized pp system of satoshi or ethereum ha special advantage or the centralized pp system instead by adopting a centralized system but strengthening the device that control the central main node to prent abuse of authority it is possible to make a more fair and unmanipulatable system than the existing decentralized system for exle a main node temporarily monopolizes the selection and execution of transaction and is forced to select and execute transaction in chronological order then the other node monitor it constantly and if it operates against principle disqualify it and appoint one of the other standby node a the main node in any case both centralized pp and decentralized pp cannot manipulate the content of a transaction that's both method already ha sold the byzantine general problem the remaining issue are of what to select and how to set execution order but rather a centralized system can operate them more fairly the transaction submited first is executed first and the gas cost may not be receid at last we come to a final conclusion the concept of the block is remod a long a the transaction are executed in the order submitted there is no reason to divide and put them in block this is no different from executing transaction in chronological order receid by bank or credit card company they no longer need the concept of block the concept of the block wa only satoshi's desperate measure and it is by no mean a logically necessary concept to achie the purpose of the block chain and the most important fact is that it is desirable to remo the concept of a block a much a possible therefore it come to the conclusion that the block concept will entually disappear the only thing that remains is the transaction chain now the blockchain must be renamed the transaction chain which will revolutionize the blockchain ecosystem the appearance of nonblockchainat least it is possible to remo the concept of block while maintaining the current lel of fairness of decentralization in bitcoin or ethereum more precisely it mean that there are theoretically infinite way to eliminate the concept of the block to impro the selection and execution order of transaction while securing fairness beyond the current lel of the fairness of decentralization in bitcoin or ethereum then what will the consensus algorithm look like if the block concept is actually remod first of all the chain is made up of only transaction this transaction chain also ha no fear of forgery at least in the content of the transaction a long a pp is the premise there is no fear of forgery or falsification of the content of a transaction whether it is on a centralized or decentralized system if so the only thing left is the selection and order of transaction who will decide them this mean going back to the point when satoshi created bitcoin based on experience or the past year satoshi ha failed on this issue for now therefore we must return to satoshi's initial starting point en if we 't like that and we ha to start or from scratch what need to be obserd here is one thing and that is enough that's the lel of fairness must be abo the current lel of bitcoin or ethereum complete fairness is impossible it's not impossible in theory but it's practically impossible unless an innovati new technology like rsa emerges the easiest thing to think about is appointing a main node in appointing the main node the status may be endowed permanently or only temporarily the most appropriate answer will be somewhere in the middle of the two it is virtually impossible to appoint and replace the main node only temporarily i e only once for each transaction satoshi wa confronted with this ry problem at that time satoshi imagined the concept of block and from this blockchain wa born and year later it wa confirmed that the concept of block wa a failure in this case the most common sense that can be thought of is to appoint a main node under a certain standard and constantly monitor it a a method you may use the platform's own code or you may use a smartcontract and if manipulation or laziness of the main node is detected a method of replacing the main node automatically or by poll is introduced en at this lel the fairness is not inferior to the former chinese mining king or specific foundation led artificial fork creation abo all this method ha the advantage of being able to set the operating standard in advance in a smartcontract a a result arbitrary fork generation is fundamentally blocked this is use the fork generation principle itself that other node follow the longest blockchain ha been remod then it can be said that it is relatily more fair than the existing decentralization system in the end that can be called proof of democracy pod decentralization which is le fair than pod is no longer decentralized entually the religion of decentralization also collapse many people still belie in this myth it is superstition use there is no technical basis the trustlessness ha a technical basis called a electronic signature hower there is no such definite technique for the permissionlessness an essential element of decentralization a demonstrated abo the block failed the decentralization ha failed in both theoretical and practical way therefore in this situation calling for decentralization is nothing more than calling for it a a simple ideology it is no more than a cry for th century anarchism decentralization without technical support is nothing more than a mere cry of ideology in reality pow and po are also fundamentally operated under the control of pod they are no longer decentralized thing let's look more specifically pow is not a mining certification method but a mining manipulation method a can be seen from china's mining king po is also only a method that can be manipulated by stakeholder there is currently no technology or method to prent the manipulation the dao crisis and the numerous fork that ha been conniently attempted since then only pro that the blockchain is accepting democracy it ultimate bastion that is it may be seen that the pow or po is only a kind of pod at present in other word all existing consensus algorithm are pod pure decentralization independent of democracy doe not currently exist therefore the method of selection and ordering of transaction can only be explored based on pod at present advantage of nonblockchain satoshi's block ended in failure hower it ha since become the standard for all blockchains most blockchains fundamentally do not deviate from satoshi's basic framework entually all of them disappear or remain only for museum use personally bitcoin's block will survi forer on the other hand ethereum is ry unstable there is absolutely no reason to maintain the block concept in the ethereum c ethereum's attempt to maintain the current block concept is an obvious long term impossibility nonblockchain ha many advantage once you can stick to the principle that is transaction may be executed in the order of reception or submission a in the previous exle if the tree method with the main node a the top is applied transaction can be executed in the order receid by the main node furthermore all transaction can be accepted without omission this is the same a the queue concept in a general computer o there is nothing special the nonblockchain would normally adopt a tree structure of course in preliminary the horizontal pp method of the current blockchain may be adopted a an auxiliary method it depends on the mainnet deloper's choice anyway if the tree structure is adopted it can boast the fastest speed theoretically there can no longer be a rapid structure the nonblockchain doe not require a concept such a gas price to determine eligibility to be included in a block use the concept of a block doe not exist in the first place it is enough to accept and implement in fact the gas cost of existing blockchains are virtually irrelevant to the node's operating cost this is use the execution of transaction and the storage of data are performed in all node but the gas cost are only probabilistically paid to miner or validators to be exact gas cost should be distributed fairly to all node in this respect the existing gas cost system is extremely unreasonable instead it is desirable to institutionalize a separate method of payment of operating expense newly and that is possible but that will not be specifically mentioned here the real purpose of existing blockchains collecting gas cost is not for operating expense the mining reward are sufficient to pay operating expense in fact the real purpose of the gas cost wa security cost this is being confessed by ethereum's official site in short gas fee help keep the ethereum network secure by requiring a fee for ery computation executed on the network we prent bad actor from spamming the network the nonblockchain collect security cost not gas cost if malicious intent is not positily recognized due to the review the collected gas cost will be returned in this way the security cost may be set high enough without resistance entually by returning the gas cost they become zero a described abo the advantage of the nonblockchain are considerable and there are no theoretical or practical obstacle to it adoption so of course the existing block concept must be discarded and a system consisting only of a pure transaction chain will inevitably emerge the nonblockchain consensus algorithm is bound to be pod for the time being for now we ha no choice but to wait for the emergence of consensus algorithm that can achie decentralization in the true sense by a genius who will appear someday until then it will only be in the form of a pod conclusionthe block wa just satoshi's impromptu idea the necessity for hash to be contiguous is only between transaction not between block a a result the name of the blockchain itself is meaningless the blockchain is only one method proposed by satoshi to realize the ideology of the transactionchain the block is not the truth the block concept wa only one of the myriad way to realize the transactionchain and it ha now reached the point of disposal the byzantine general problem wa not sold by satoshi but wa just a problem that had already been sold by cryptography it wa the electronic signature looking inside the blockchain at the current stage there are no particularly remarkable technology other than the electronic signature other technology are only those that ha already existed or can be deloped by ordinary programmer it is absurd to try to achie decentralization with only such poor equipment in other word the crypto world at this stage doe not ha the ability to realize the ideal of blockchain a

1,a lesson from ftx it seems like the biggest takeaway after ftx ha been realed to be insolnt is that cold storage is the only way to go hower i belie most people are orlooking the biggest potential concern that can be drawn from it there were giant centralized exchange in cryptocurrency binance coinbase and ftx one of them is now on the brink of bankruptcy there is a huge danger in narrowing that list to two if a large percentage of people decide to sell after what s happened how can we know that coinbase and binance ha enough liquidity to facilitate withdrawal one of the first thing that happened during the great depression were mass attempt to withdraw cash from bank who did not ha that cash on hand stable coin are not a solution if you can t sell them you can t spend them tether limited is not the federal reser no matter how much usdt is minted they cannot create more usd out of thin air i m aware of tether limited s claim that usdt is backed but with the massi increase in price across the market that we seen or the past two year the resers of cash in comparison to the rising price ha to be dwindling i m not trying to fear monger but people should be more concerned and should be demanding more transparency for centralized exchange ledger or trezor wallet cannot be frozen but if centralized platform t ha enough cash to pay out to those who want to sell then it completely undercut any value proposition for cryptocurrency regardless of whater the price is or how much your wallet is saying it s worth

1,legal guidance for u ethereum stakers re ofac compliance is there any legal guidance available for u solo staking validators needing to censor ofac blacklisted ethereum address my understanding is there is no way to do this in the default vanilla configuration instead you would need to use third party software by flashbots called mev boost and then select relayers that state they will be censoring ofac blacklisted address i am unable to find much in the way of formal legal guidance re this obligation there is some factual evidence for u based validators not needing to censor ofac transaction but they are all circumstantial such evidence includes few if any bitcoin miner currently censor ofac transaction ethereum miner prior to po mostly did not censor ofac transaction the only exception to this wa ethermine and they did not start censoring ofac transaction until after tornado cash wa added a few week prior to the merge there is no indication they censored before tornado cash wa added to the ofac list en now many large u based validators are running vanilla configuration without censoring such a coinbase kraken and staked u persumably they would not do so if they thought this wa against ofac regulation i am wondering if anyone ha any access to any real legal analysis in this regard my concern would be treasury ofac is a dept of the treasury would be more likely to target solo validators to make an exle out of them since they would not ha the resoucres to defend themsels than a large exchange or other centralized entity such a coinbase or kraken then they could use any settlement or conviction a precedent to then go after the larger centralized actor
